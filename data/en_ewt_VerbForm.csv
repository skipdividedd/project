tr	Fin	Al - Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border .
tr	Fin	DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad .
tr	Fin	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J . Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s .
tr	Fin	You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets .
tr	Fin	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Fin	Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul .
tr	Fin	The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings .
tr	Fin	( Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population , who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in .
tr	Fin	This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center - north of the country .)
tr	Fin	Guerrillas killed an engineer , Asi Ali , from Tikrit .
tr	Fin	They also killed Shaikh Hamid ' Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit .
tr	Fin	Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers .
tr	Fin	One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
tr	Fin	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Fin	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Fin	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Fin	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Fin	This item is a small one and easily missed .
tr	Fin	But in my view it is highly significant .
tr	Fin	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Fin	Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
tr	Fin	A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died .
tr	Fin	The trial begins again Nov . 28 .
tr	Fin	In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya .
tr	Fin	Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
tr	Fin	Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars , they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area , then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK - 47 ' s in the air .
tr	Fin	And there is nothing we can do about it really , people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land .
tr	Fin	Everyone is apprehensive , there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days .
tr	Fin	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Fin	What irritates me is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi ' ite clerics , we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance , and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as ' Ba ' athists ', ' Saddamites ', ' Wahhabis ', and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago .
tr	Fin	So what happened ?
tr	Fin	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Fin	Speaking of Fallujah , we have only Al - Jazeera to rely on for our news from there .
tr	Fin	Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents .
tr	Fin	Al - Iraqiyah tv said that ICDC were controlling Ramadi .
tr	Fin	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Fin	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Fin	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Fin	This is not a post about fault - finding or assigning blame .
tr	Fin	It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
tr	Fin	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
tr	Fin	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
tr	Fin	Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
tr	Fin	The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .
tr	Fin	However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
tr	Fin	Here are some excerpts :
tr	Fin	The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
tr	Fin	There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl .
tr	Fin	There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl .
tr	Fin	Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions .
tr	Fin	These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl :
tr	Fin	I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing .
tr	Fin	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Fin	The Chernobyl Children ' s Project ( http :// www . adiccp . org / home / default . asp ) offers several ways to help the children of that region .
tr	Fin	One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
tr	Fin	S . and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
tr	Fin	Take care , my friend , Linda
tr	Fin	I ' m sorry to say Elena ' s story has been revealed to be a fake .
tr	Fin	The tape was a way to signal priorities .
tr	Fin	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .
tr	Fin	MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelters Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .
tr	Fin	All this is highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot schemes .
tr	Fin	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Fin	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Fin	The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism , and even the threat of nuclear war , than Iraq ever did .
tr	Fin	Israel owes the United States at least this much , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace .
tr	Fin	Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there .
tr	Fin	Certainly , the Shiites already hate al - Qaeda and would help ; likewise the Kurds .
tr	Fin	The problem of mollifying the Sunnis , though , has to be solved to avoid giving al - Qaeda an entrée .
tr	Fin	The Americans have to put away their free - market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households .
tr	Fin	We need an FDR in Iraq , not a Ronald Reagan .
tr	Fin	George W . Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .
tr	Fin	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Fin	Let ' s just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :
tr	Fin	' Bush fails reporter ' s pop quiz on international leaders
tr	Fin	The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
tr	Fin	Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan .
tr	Fin	"Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as "" Lee ."""
tr	Fin	Hiller asked , inquiring about Gen . Pervaiz Musharraf , who seized control of the country October 12 .
tr	Fin	""" Wait , wait , is this 50 questions ?"" asked Bush ."
tr	Fin	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Fin	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Fin	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Fin	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Fin	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Fin	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Fin	A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush ' s comments .
tr	Fin	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Fin	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Fin	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Fin	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Fin	"He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with "" stability ."""
tr	Fin	Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year .
tr	Fin	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Fin	"This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "" stability "" to the region in fall of 1999 ."
tr	Fin	Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then .
tr	Fin	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Fin	"Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the U . S . has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians ."""
tr	Fin	Israel , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
tr	Fin	Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
tr	Fin	The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements .
tr	Fin	Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians .
tr	Fin	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Fin	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Fin	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Fin	The bungling of post - war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state .
tr	Fin	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
tr	Fin	Anti - Israeli and pro - Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents .
tr	Fin	The more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran ' s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
tr	Fin	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
tr	Fin	Worse for Israel , the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites .
tr	Fin	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Fin	Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine .
tr	Fin	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , which is popular in Jordan .
tr	Fin	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post - Saddam Iraq are no exception .
tr	Fin	Whereas Saddam Hussein ' s dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , they are now free to organize .
tr	Fin	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .

tr	Fin	THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global
tr	Fin	Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
tr	Fin	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Fin	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Fin	And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s four - day visit to India recently .
tr	Fin	For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga ' s government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
tr	Fin	"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive ,"" Muni told IPS ."
tr	Fin	Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
tr	Fin	But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .
tr	Fin	Kumaratunga ' s India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .
tr	Fin	Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .
tr	Fin	But they , too , failed .
tr	Fin	Colombo , too , seems to be in an intractable position .
tr	Fin	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Fin	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Fin	Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .
tr	Fin	""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement ,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview ."
tr	Fin	In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .
tr	Fin	However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .
tr	Fin	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Fin	Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US $ 4 . 5 billion .
tr	Fin	Japan ' s special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
tr	Fin	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Fin	"The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces ."""
tr	Fin	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Fin	"She added that recent visits to the island by India ' s top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island ""."
tr	Fin	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Fin	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""
tr	Fin	Musharraf calls the bluff
tr	Fin	Two years ago , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements .
tr	Fin	The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
tr	Fin	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Fin	India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China ( which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
tr	Fin	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Fin	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
tr	Fin	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U . S . State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .
tr	Fin	Despite Sept . 11 , the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy .
tr	Fin	Despite many wrinkles , India remains a part - democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op - ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly .
tr	Fin	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Fin	With Colin Powell around , the U . S . has no need of an Osama bin Laden
tr	Fin	M . D . Nalapat , an expert on jihad , is professor of geopolitics at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education , India .
tr	Fin	We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam .
tr	Fin	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Fin	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Fin	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Fin	The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
tr	Fin	( Click here for source . )
tr	Fin	And , let ' s remember , flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous !
tr	Fin	What follows is the text of an e - mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ).
tr	Fin	Read on to learn the facts .
tr	Fin	Before you fall for Dems ’ spin , here are the facts
tr	Fin	That he missed a physical ?
tr	Fin	That his daddy got him in ?
tr	Fin	So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :
tr	Fin	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
tr	Fin	Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
tr	Fin	That was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training periods thrown in as well .
tr	Fin	It was full - time work .
tr	Fin	After training , Bush kept flying , racking up hundreds of hours in F - 102 jets .
tr	Fin	As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
tr	Fin	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Fin	Bush earned 340 points in 1969 - 1970 .
tr	Fin	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Fin	He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
tr	Fin	And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
tr	Fin	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Fin	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti - Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ).
tr	Fin	Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .
tr	Fin	His superior officers said OK .
tr	Fin	Requests like that weren ’ t unusual , says retired Col . William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
tr	Fin	“ In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots ,” Campenni says .
tr	Fin	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Fin	So Bush stopped flying .
tr	Fin	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Fin	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Fin	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Fin	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Fin	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Fin	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Fin	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Fin	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer .”
tr	Fin	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Fin	Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry ’ s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
tr	Fin	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Fin	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it ’ s important or not in November .
tr	Fin	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Fin	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty .”
tr	Fin	Earlier , Kerry said , “ Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question .”
tr	Fin	That ’ s fine .
tr	Fin	Byron York is a White House correspondent for National Review .
tr	Fin	His column appears in The Hill each week .
tr	Fin	One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
tr	Fin	I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week .
tr	Fin	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Fin	Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi ' s Al - Iraqiya list .
tr	Fin	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' gifts ' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi , a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis .
tr	Fin	Sheikh Naji Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list .
tr	Fin	Indeed , Sistani ' s agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
tr	Fin	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Fin	Again there is no official written statement from Sistani ' s office confirming this allegation , which I think is intentional .
tr	Fin	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Fin	It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha ' lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
tr	Fin	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Fin	Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
tr	Fin	I doubt that will be the outcome though .
tr	Fin	The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
tr	Fin	Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
tr	Fin	Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April , 2004 , with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques .
tr	Fin	I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
tr	Fin	After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can ' t mention here .
tr	Fin	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Fin	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Fin	Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation .
tr	Fin	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Fin	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Fin	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Fin	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Fin	But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I don ' t believe the US is going anywhere so soon .
tr	Fin	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Fin	Very recently , US forces in Al - Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul - Razaq Inad Al - Gu ' ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe .
tr	Fin	The Gu ' ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al - Anbar governor some months back .
tr	Fin	The Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid - nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe .
tr	Fin	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
tr	Fin	Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
tr	Fin	I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
tr	Fin	Even partition is not a possibility , there are no clear borders between the two .
tr	Fin	Here ' s a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , published yesterday .
tr	Fin	"("" At first I hid a lot ."
tr	Fin	I thought the US government was looking for me .
tr	Fin	"Now I hide a lot less ."")"
tr	Fin	Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada ' s whereabouts with an indefinite shrug .
tr	Fin	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Fin	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Fin	And though he ' d been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
tr	Fin	"Meiring ' s crimes are fresh , and wave the false flag which is the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Fin	They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
tr	Fin	( Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines .)
tr	Fin	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Fin	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Fin	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Fin	But Posada ' s nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that ' s a vain hope .
tr	Fin	Meiring is more than an embarrassment .
tr	Fin	"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Fin	Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
tr	Fin	I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives .
tr	Fin	Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell ' s whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics .
tr	Fin	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross - examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .
tr	Fin	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
tr	Fin	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Fin	Then Charles A . Briggs came to the rescue .
tr	Fin	"Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records "" for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P . Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA ."""
tr	Fin	"The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson did not work "" directly or indirectly "" for the CIA since retiring ."
tr	Fin	Last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , threw out Wilson ' s two - decades old conviction .
tr	Fin	Judge Hughes wrote : ` government knowingly used false evidence against him ,' concluding ` honesty comes hard to government .'
tr	Fin	looks like it is rearing its head again in Louisianna ..
tr	Fin	Sheriff ' s deputies in Louisiana made a third arrest Wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of children and animals at a Ponchatoula , La ., church .
tr	Fin	Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church .
tr	Fin	We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose .
tr	Fin	Now that ' s a post I can relate to .

tr	Fin	And It ' s Not Hard To Do .... IF You Know HOW .
tr	Fin	Don ' t Let This Pass You By Without At Least Taking A Look .
tr	Fin	The Only Catch Is That You HAVE To Have An Income ABOVE $ 21 , 000 ...... And ...... You HAVE To Follow The Easy Instructions Provided To You .
tr	Fin	In early February , India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ).
tr	Fin	It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar .
tr	Fin	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Fin	Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , which took a heavy toll on the Andamans .
tr	Fin	"Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy ' s Far Eastern Naval Command , now being established along with India ' s "" blue water navy ""."
tr	Fin	Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
tr	Fin	The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base .
tr	Fin	The drugs and arms travel in all directions .
tr	Fin	"Since the "" Sea Tigers "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
tr	Fin	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Fin	This is not unknown to New Delhi .
tr	Fin	A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands , using fake Indian ration cards , while citizens of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave .
tr	Fin	""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell ' s Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners ,"" he said ."
tr	Fin	"An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50 , 000 "" foreigners "" in the Andaman Islands , but unofficial figures are much higher than this ."
tr	Fin	A large number of them are Bangladeshis , who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere .
tr	Fin	As most of them have few technical skills , and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case , they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities .
tr	Fin	The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns , cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous .
tr	Fin	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Fin	These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily , bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia .
tr	Fin	In 2001 , according to Indian army officials , security forces launched a wide - ranging operation in the 300 - some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar , and found huge caches of arms .
tr	Fin	In addition , LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers .
tr	Fin	A shipment of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars , left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex - Joux 3 .
tr	Fin	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Fin	In 1997 , the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition .
tr	Fin	Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
tr	Fin	Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante , an island off the coat of Myanmar , west of the Andaman islands .
tr	Fin	Subsequently , Phuket became the LTTE ' s main backup base .
tr	Fin	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Fin	The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building - up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less - strong militant groups .
tr	Fin	A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan .
tr	Fin	The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox ' s Bazar passes through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong .
tr	Fin	India ' s Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1 , 000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal .
tr	Fin	Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia .
tr	Fin	The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans , which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south .
tr	Fin	Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non - Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island .
tr	Fin	Ramtanu Maitra writes for a number of international journals and is a regular contributor to the Washington - based EIR and the New Delhi - based Indian Defense Review .
tr	Fin	He also writes for Aakrosh , India ' s defense - tied quarterly journal .
tr	Fin	[ Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Fin	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Fin	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Fin	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Fin	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Fin	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate . ]
tr	Fin	“ The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all .
tr	Fin	Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan ,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan ’ s English daily The Nation .
tr	Fin	That changed on September 22 when President George W . Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
tr	Fin	Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting , said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully .
tr	Fin	‘’ Where are Mullah Omar , Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar ?’’
tr	Fin	All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan .
tr	Fin	( Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban , Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb - e - Islami .)
tr	Fin	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Fin	‘’ Bush was very well briefed before the meeting ,’’ the diplomat said .
tr	Fin	An Afghan official at the meeting added , ‘’ The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda .’’
tr	Fin	Karzai was clearly pleased at the results .
tr	Fin	‘’ President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban ,’’ says Karzai .
tr	Fin	The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans .
tr	Fin	However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
tr	Fin	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Fin	However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
tr	Fin	‘’ Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before ,’’ says Lt . General David Barno .
tr	Fin	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Fin	Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
tr	Fin	However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .
tr	Fin	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Fin	Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders , who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency .
tr	Fin	With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home .
tr	Fin	Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt . General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
tr	Fin	Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Fin	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Fin	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Fin	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Fin	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Fin	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate .
tr	Fin	Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
tr	Fin	In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai , Iran , Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai .
tr	Fin	Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .
tr	Fin	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Fin	Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran ’ s border .
tr	Fin	Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan ’ s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai ’ s campaign against warlords .
tr	Fin	At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’ s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo - conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively , the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran .
tr	Fin	Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand .
tr	Fin	However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran .
tr	Fin	‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters ,’’ says Barno .
tr	Fin	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .
tr	Fin	So far what they have done together has been good for us and that ’ s how we would like to keep it ’’, says Karzai .
tr	Fin	In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections , they would be resisted .
tr	Fin	Many Taliban living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai .
tr	Fin	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Fin	Or they weren ' t eyewitnesses and are just lying .
tr	Fin	If some of John Kerry ' s wounds were superficial , Bush received no wounds .
tr	Fin	That is the logic of the medal ).
tr	Fin	Kerry saved a man ' s life while under fire .
tr	Fin	Bush did no such thing .
tr	Fin	He gave no service to anyone , risked nothing , and did not even slack off efficiently .
tr	Fin	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Fin	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Fin	"( Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet , "" Let heads roll !"")"
tr	Fin	That temper is only one problem .
tr	Fin	Bush has a sadistic streak .
tr	Fin	He clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching executions .
tr	Fin	His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
tr	Fin	"Even for those who later abstain , "" visual - spatial abilities , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , are the slowest to recover ."""
tr	Fin	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Fin	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Fin	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Fin	Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
tr	Fin	But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
tr	Fin	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Fin	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Fin	"There is one place in Alabama where Mr . Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Fin	NPR ' s Wade Goodwyn has this report about Mr . Bush ' s time on that campaign .
tr	Fin	In 1972 , Baba Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign .
tr	Fin	Groom was Republican Red Blount ' s scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
tr	Fin	Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas , and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday .
tr	Fin	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Fin	It was a Texas accent .
tr	Fin	But he just melded with everybody .
tr	Fin	Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days .
tr	Fin	Blount ' s support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon ' s postmaster general .
tr	Fin	In Washington , Blount became friends and tennis partners with Mr . Bush ' s father , then Congressman Bush .
tr	Fin	That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father ' s urging . . .
tr	Fin	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Fin	But throughout Alabama , there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to help Red Blount .
tr	Fin	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Fin	Groom says this job helped Mr . Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics are local .
tr	Fin	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Fin	Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr . Bush was not one of them .
tr	Fin	GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of ' 72 , Red Blount ' s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr . Bush ' s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
tr	Fin	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Fin	After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr . Bush about it .
tr	Fin	The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
tr	Fin	In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
tr	Fin	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Fin	GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr . Bush enjoyed his freedom .
tr	Fin	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Fin	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Fin	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Fin	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Fin	Mr . ARCHIBALD : People have different ways of starting the days in any office .
tr	Fin	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Fin	GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr . Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
tr	Fin	Mr . ARCHIBALD : I mean , at that time , I was 28 ; George would have been 25 or 26 .
tr	Fin	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Fin	I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
tr	Fin	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Fin	Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn ' t remember George telling drunk stories .
tr	Fin	"But that means nothing , since they weren ' t the sort of things guys like Bush told the "" girls ""."
tr	Fin	Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger .
tr	Fin	When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
tr	Fin	Just remember that death is not the end
tr	Fin	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
tr	Fin	Just remember that death is not the end - Bob Dylan
tr	Fin	( also see this thread on the RI discussion board ):
tr	Fin	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Fin	"Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : "" It ' s unbelievable that no one can account for 200 , 000 assault rifles ."
tr	Fin	American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq .
tr	Fin	But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights , which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005 .
tr	Fin	"A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "" any weapons from Bosnia "" and added they were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia ""."
tr	Fin	"A NATO spokesman said : "" There ' s no tracking mechanism to ensure they don ' t fall into the wrong hands ."
tr	Fin	"There are concerns that some may have been siphoned off ."""
tr	Fin	This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re - routed to al - Qaeda .
tr	Fin	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Fin	It ' s always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration ' s harshest mainstream critics .
tr	Fin	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Fin	And it ' s guilty :
tr	Fin	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Fin	The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
tr	Fin	Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .
tr	Fin	""" It was about how he could humiliate her the most ,"" prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments ."
tr	Fin	""" He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself ."""
tr	Fin	"After the sentencing one of Robinson ' s tearful supporters "" turned to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [ SNAP ], who had helped reopen the case , and told her , ' I hope you rot in hell !'"""
tr	Fin	More than ever , police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes , even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions .
tr	Fin	When victims and witnesses stay silent , nothing changes .
tr	Fin	SNAP is right in part .
tr	Fin	Police and prosecutors have the tools .
tr	Fin	The will is another matter .
tr	Fin	Some do , individually .
tr	Fin	That ' s still the domain of those who don ' t .
tr	Fin	lots of important stories out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good souls for that conviction .
tr	Fin	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Fin	"At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state officials said Jeffs "" is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards ."""
tr	Fin	"An editorial in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "" the state ' s history , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet ' s nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach lawmakers and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities ."""
tr	Fin	""" There ' s no tracking mechanism in place ""?!?!?"
tr	Fin	Never mind .
tr	Fin	I ' m sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
tr	Fin	We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming ....
tr	Fin	just go here , its simply amazing
tr	Fin	i count like 14 explosive headlines .
tr	Fin	Then , of course , there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case ...
tr	Fin	Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
tr	Fin	I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
tr	Fin	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
tr	Fin	Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life .
tr	Fin	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .

tr	Fin	US outsourcing special ops , intelligence to Iraq terror group , intelligence officials say
tr	Fin	The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ...
tr	Fin	A country deserves the leaders it has , my friends ...
tr	Fin	And MEK -- the Iranian ( not Iraqi ) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult :
tr	Fin	As the leaders like to boast , the Mujahedeen is a family affair .
tr	Fin	('' We have three generations of martyrs : grandmothers , mothers , daughters .'')
tr	Fin	When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
tr	Fin	Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
tr	Fin	'' Every morning and night , the kids , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute them and shout praises to them ,'' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told me .
tr	Fin	Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
tr	Fin	The Rajavis , Afshari went on to say , '' saw these kids as the next generation ' s soldiers .
tr	Fin	They wanted to brainwash them and control them .''
tr	Fin	One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don ' t know what they are , don ' t care , or know perfectly well .

tr	Fin	How are chants of death and suicide ... morality .
tr	Fin	They were death metal brainwashed fans , literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
tr	Fin	( not church morality , no that is phoney , love thy neighbor ... hell no , kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????)
tr	Fin	I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article .
tr	Fin	I think the jury ' s still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers .
tr	Fin	The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .
tr	Fin	Irony is dead ... Long live Irony !
tr	Fin	That ' s it .
tr	Fin	Well , it ' s not as simple and clear cut as all that .
tr	Fin	Imaginary evil is romantic and varied ; real evil is gloomy , monotonous , barren , boring .
tr	Fin	Imaginary good is boring ; real good is always new , marvelous , intoxicating .
tr	Fin	The answer is likely D : all of the above , due to this being a complex reality we live in .
tr	Fin	But to me , without question , they often know perfectly well .
tr	Fin	Here is a thought : When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Fin	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ""."
tr	Fin	& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old .
tr	Fin	"Since the article was specifically about "" death metal "" I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality :"
tr	Fin	One man ' s relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post - war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year .
tr	Fin	In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino , both just 16 , disappeared .
tr	Fin	The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together .
tr	Fin	But their parents refused to accept this .
tr	Fin	Michele Tollis , Fabio ' s father , began to attend metal concerts and festivals across Europe , handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio ' s friends .
tr	Fin	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Fin	It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
tr	Fin	During this search , Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son ' s disappearance .
tr	Fin	"They ' re inseparable ,"" he says ."
tr	Fin	"Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : "" To hell with death ""."
tr	Fin	"I wholly agree , and would expand that statement to include : "" To hell with death metal ""."
tr	Fin	Talk about a beat - your - head - against - the - wall moment !
tr	Fin	And for ' Smartwolf ' above , think about the inversion principle being employed .
tr	Fin	( I know , ignorant question ) Then why call them , or any other phonies ' Christians ', even if they themselves claim the appellation .
tr	Fin	They are merely imposters .
tr	Fin	Everything they claim is a lie , and this above all .
tr	Fin	This only serves their purposes .
tr	Fin	They want to be identified as ' Christians ', and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician ' s practice of the inversion principle .
tr	Fin	We need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
tr	Fin	See them as they are , not for what they claim to be .
tr	Fin	... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Fin	Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of ' degenerate art ' in 1937 , while curating a parallel show of ' Aryan ' art across the street .

tr	Fin	Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the ' imaginary ' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon , which is this global system .
tr	Fin	Is the distinction accurate and valid ?
tr	Fin	This is where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum comes into play .
tr	Fin	so , enemy , what ' s your point ?
tr	Fin	My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
tr	Fin	Here ' s another interesting example :
tr	Fin	Balance died in 2004 after a ' fall .'
tr	Fin	He blended belief systems such as Shamanism , Christianity , Buddhism , Paganism , Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil ' s vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners .

tr	Fin	I ' m a regular poster but for some reason blogger won ' t let me in today ... but sign me TroubleFunk .
tr	Fin	Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
tr	Fin	For example , is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?
tr	Fin	Similarly , is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system ?
tr	Fin	In regards to death metal , the problem is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture .
tr	Fin	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
tr	Fin	A bit of a knee - jerk reaction from me there , and I apologize for my over - generalizations .
tr	Fin	My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion .
tr	Fin	True believers are dangerous animals .
tr	Fin	Also , I ' m quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses .
tr	Fin	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush ' s claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
tr	Fin	"I seem to remember something about ' by their works shall ye know them ."""
tr	Fin	Again , I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly .
tr	Fin	These people are dangerous wether they ' re head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers '.
tr	Fin	( The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic ....)
tr	Fin	I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non - violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it ' s important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
tr	Fin	I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US ' s local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
tr	Fin	It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi - nation corporation .
tr	Fin	It ' s a long but very worthwhile read .
tr	Fin	""" As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological "" entertainment "" in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come ."
tr	Fin	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
tr	Fin	I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non - Arab and also significant non - Moslem minorities .
tr	Fin	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Fin	The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Fin	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Fin	The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Fin	The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Fin	The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
tr	Fin	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
tr	Fin	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Fin	They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
tr	Fin	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Fin	Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
tr	Fin	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Fin	Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
tr	Fin	The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
tr	Fin	Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
tr	Fin	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Fin	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Fin	A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
tr	Fin	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Fin	They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
tr	Fin	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Fin	* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder .*
tr	Fin	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
tr	Fin	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Fin	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Fin	Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
tr	Fin	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
tr	Fin	September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
tr	Fin	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
tr	Fin	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
tr	Fin	So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
tr	Fin	It creates headlines .
tr	Fin	It is spectacular .
tr	Fin	It is frightening .
tr	Fin	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Fin	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
tr	Fin	Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
tr	Fin	Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
tr	Fin	Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .
tr	Fin	And it is a war !
tr	Fin	What is behind the suicide murders ?
tr	Fin	Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
tr	Fin	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
tr	Fin	Aren ' t they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
tr	Fin	Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
tr	Fin	They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
tr	Fin	Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
tr	Fin	The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
tr	Fin	It never happens there .
tr	Fin	There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
tr	Fin	There was certainly more despair in Saddam ' s Iraq than in Paul Bremmer ' s Iraq , and no one exploded himself .
tr	Fin	A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
tr	Fin	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Fin	The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
tr	Fin	Turkey understands it well .
tr	Fin	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
tr	Fin	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Fin	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
tr	Fin	* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies .*
tr	Fin	Words can be lethal .
tr	Fin	They kill people .
tr	Fin	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
tr	Fin	An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
tr	Fin	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Fin	Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
tr	Fin	Mr . Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
tr	Fin	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Fin	When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
tr	Fin	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Fin	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Fin	I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
tr	Fin	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid - day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
tr	Fin	She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
tr	Fin	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
tr	Fin	"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "", the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader ""."
tr	Fin	There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
tr	Fin	These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
tr	Fin	They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
tr	Fin	It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
tr	Fin	* 3 . The third aspect is money .*
tr	Fin	In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
tr	Fin	The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
tr	Fin	These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
tr	Fin	Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
tr	Fin	This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
tr	Fin	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Fin	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Fin	The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
tr	Fin	Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
tr	Fin	Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
tr	Fin	Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
tr	Fin	You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
tr	Fin	"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
tr	Fin	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Fin	* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws .*
tr	Fin	The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
tr	Fin	There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
tr	Fin	Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
tr	Fin	Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti - democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
tr	Fin	These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
tr	Fin	But now we have an entire new set .
tr	Fin	All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
tr	Fin	Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
tr	Fin	I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
tr	Fin	"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as "" war criminals ,"" with some Western media repeating the allegations ."
tr	Fin	The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
tr	Fin	The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
tr	Fin	The picture I described here is not pretty .
tr	Fin	Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter - propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
tr	Fin	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Fin	Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
tr	Fin	If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
tr	Fin	But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
tr	Fin	Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
tr	Fin	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Fin	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Fin	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Fin	It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
tr	Fin	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Fin	It is ruthless .
tr	Fin	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Fin	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Fin	Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
tr	Fin	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Fin	When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
tr	Fin	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Fin	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Fin	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Fin	Above all , never surrender to terror .
tr	Fin	What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
tr	Fin	Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
tr	Fin	If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
tr	Fin	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Fin	On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
tr	Fin	I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
tr	Fin	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Fin	Europe , more than any other region , is the key .
tr	Fin	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Fin	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Fin	"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ("" CIA "") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax ."
tr	Fin	"An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "" unbelievable "" biological attack , the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("" KSM "")."
tr	Fin	In November 2003 , a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties .
tr	Fin	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Fin	Photographs from a seized computer disc included the controls and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot .
tr	Fin	In a bulletin , the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon .
tr	Fin	This is old news .
tr	Fin	It ' s just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI ' s ( former ) theory about a lone , American scientist .
tr	Fin	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Fin	Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 , included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise .
tr	Fin	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Fin	Mabruk , at the time , was the head of Jihad ' s military operations .
tr	Fin	There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development .
tr	Fin	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Fin	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Fin	"In March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9 / 11 but was to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Fin	Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $ 14 , 000 in July , accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks .
tr	Fin	KSM explained that Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US - trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative , Malaysian Yazid Sufaat .
tr	Fin	KSM and Hambali sent al - Hindi ( al - Britani ), along with Jafar the Pilot , to case NYC targets for a second wave .
tr	Fin	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Fin	Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
tr	Fin	He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader .
tr	Fin	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Fin	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Fin	After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow , Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape .
tr	Fin	He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise .
tr	Fin	Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9 / 11 on US soil .
tr	Fin	At one time , some thought he had been spotted in Iran .
tr	Fin	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Fin	The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released .
tr	Fin	( Khalid Mohammed ' s involvement dates back to Bojinka , as does Hambali ' s ).
tr	Fin	In May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9 / 11 Commission .
tr	Fin	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Fin	The same week , the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes , they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received .
tr	Fin	Zawahiri , Al Qaeda ' s # 2 , is head of Al Qaeda ' s biochemical program .
tr	Fin	The confidante and right - hand man of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets .
tr	Fin	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Fin	A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
tr	Fin	There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 .
tr	Fin	Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources .
tr	Fin	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Fin	At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek , under the optimal method , there is no electrostatic charge .
tr	Fin	In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings , there was an electrostatic charge .
tr	Fin	Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns .
tr	Fin	( Spores must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable .)
tr	Fin	Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
tr	Fin	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Fin	"The "" trillion spore "" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
tr	Fin	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Fin	USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , in sensational detail , of Atta ' s inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster .
tr	Fin	Khalid Mohammed then told interrogators that Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusting may have related to Yazid Sufaat ' s anthrax manufacturing plans .
tr	Fin	Al Qaeda had both the means and opportunity .
tr	Fin	US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9 / 11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 .
tr	Fin	"Sufaat was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ("" JI "")."
tr	Fin	JI has ties with the Moro Front .
tr	Fin	Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda .
tr	Fin	"( Green symbolizes "" Islam "" and Prophet Mohammed ' s holy war )."
tr	Fin	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Fin	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Fin	"The crop dusters were to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Fin	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Fin	"Newsweek reported that a "" second wave "" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support ."
tr	Fin	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Fin	Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning .
tr	Fin	It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui , who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology .
tr	Fin	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Fin	Understandably , Amerithrax is a confidential investigation .
tr	Fin	The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt .
tr	Fin	As agent Van Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation said , the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information .
tr	Fin	Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March .
tr	Fin	Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad .
tr	Fin	( Karachi is in the south ).
tr	Fin	"The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda ' s "" Chemical Wire Group ."""
tr	Fin	The family ' s lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station .
tr	Fin	That was the last Ismat heard from her .
tr	Fin	Aafia never reached the uncle ' s house .
tr	Fin	"Perhaps something got lost in the translation , but the phrase "" Chemical Wire Group "" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers ."
tr	Fin	The family ' s attorney advises me that Aafia had no knowledge of chemicals ( and that would not appear to be her training ).
tr	Fin	"There still is a very hot pursuit of the "" Atta - level "" Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting ."
tr	Fin	"His nickname is "" Jafar the Pilot ."""
tr	Fin	A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot .
tr	Fin	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Fin	The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically - based preconceptions .
tr	Fin	In early June 2003 , a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax .
tr	Fin	The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan .
tr	Fin	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Fin	The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program at Kandahar .
tr	Fin	Iraq , however , remains a possible source of the Ames .
tr	Fin	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Fin	The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq ' s secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
tr	Fin	According to at least some reports , Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad .
tr	Fin	"The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "" liberals ."""
tr	Fin	"Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "" Leahy Law "" to military and security forces ."
tr	Fin	Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI ' s involvement in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries .
tr	Fin	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Fin	Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries .
tr	Fin	This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remains foremost in the mind of Dr . Zawahiri .
tr	Fin	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Fin	Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq .
tr	Fin	Al Qaeda had a motive in mind .
tr	Fin	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Fin	Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
tr	Fin	"Most of the "" talking heads "" on television , however , knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers ."
tr	Fin	The FBI ' s profile includes a US - based supporter of the militant islamists .
tr	Fin	"Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "" either - or "" approach is not useful ."
tr	Fin	There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage .
tr	Fin	A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the conclusion that there were not one , but two , such mailings containing anthrax .
tr	Fin	( The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun ).
tr	Fin	( News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun .)
tr	Fin	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Fin	The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D . C ..
tr	Fin	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Fin	( There initially was an outstanding $ 2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program , the reward now is up to $ 5 million .).
tr	Fin	There was no claim of responsibility .
tr	Fin	There was no explanation .
tr	Fin	That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 .
tr	Fin	He reportedly treated them like sons .
tr	Fin	Although while in jail in the early 1980s , Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik ' s ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group , Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman ' s friends .
tr	Fin	Thus , the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center .
tr	Fin	"As Brian Jenkins once said , "" terrorism is theater ."""
tr	Fin	A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
tr	Fin	"There ' s even a chapter titled "" Poisonous Letter "" in the Al Qaeda manual ."
tr	Fin	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Fin	"Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "" The 19 Martyrs ."""
tr	Fin	"A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "" In the Hearts of Green Birds "" refers to what is inside ."
tr	Fin	"The mailer ' s use of "" Greendale School "" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing ."
tr	Fin	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Fin	Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed ' s color .
tr	Fin	By Greendale School , the anthrax perp was being cute , just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
tr	Fin	""" Dale "" means "" river valley ."""
tr	Fin	Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i . e ., Cairo ' s Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group .
tr	Fin	In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise .
tr	Fin	"As to opportunity , though seldom reported , there is a wealth of "" open source "" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada ."
tr	Fin	The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought .
tr	Fin	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Fin	Whatever your political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve our support .
tr	Fin	We are , after all , in this together .
tr	Fin	First , the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI is doing .
tr	Fin	Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources .
tr	Fin	Second , hindsight is 20 / 20 .
tr	Fin	"Third , with the "" new age "" Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . in charge of the investigation , it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security ."
tr	Fin	"Finally , the "" Hatfill theory "" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor ."
tr	Fin	Leahy ' s chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right - winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted .
tr	Fin	The judge , frustrated by the apparent lack of progress , encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed ( and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint ).
tr	Fin	Typically , we receive both FX and inflation from you , but both curves may not always be used .
tr	Fin	I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests .
tr	Fin	For now , this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and / or inflation curves .
tr	Fin	Puerto Rico CPI only ( I need historical inflation data , as well )
tr	Fin	Brazil we have current data already
tr	Fin	China we have current data already
tr	Fin	I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting / IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already .
tr	Fin	Please send us the list of the curves that you will need to revalue our international assets for the August Board meeting .
tr	Fin	I have to decline the invitation with regrets .
tr	Fin	I have too many commitments right now .
tr	Fin	See you all there - this is ling overdue
tr	Fin	See you all there - this is ling overdue
tr	Fin	However , when we were talking about this position , Mike compared Sara to Elena .
tr	Fin	Elena ' s title is admin coordinator , and I know that Sara should not have this title , and honestly do not think that Elena should also .
tr	Fin	Admin coordinator ' s do primarily administrative work .
tr	Fin	I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah ' s duties / level to other Sr . Spec . in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent , or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad .
tr	Fin	Please advise .
tr	Fin	I appreciate all your help .
tr	Fin	This was ( another ) nice deal for Enron .
tr	Fin	We save $ 21 , 000 in real money this way , the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server , using a box that wasn ' t being used by anyone .
tr	Fin	I ' m happy about this .
tr	Fin	Anne , please , include this info in Iris ' file
tr	Fin	The above services provide no value to me personally .
tr	Fin	Appreciate the idea .
tr	Fin	I believe ENE will continue to be range bound , but in case it is not , I don ' t want to forgo 50 % of my option premium .
tr	Fin	I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy .
tr	Fin	To that regards , I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls .
tr	Fin	Please look into that for me .
tr	Fin	Of course , you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce .
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place , but maybe @ 73 .
tr	Fin	Call me if you ' re interested .
tr	Fin	Who cares ??????
tr	Fin	Please note that effective immediately my email address has changed to Sean . Cooper @ ElPaso . com
tr	Fin	Your buddy Beau invited me .
tr	Fin	already have plans on thursday .
tr	Fin	oh god is there an agenda .
tr	Fin	already have plans on thursday .
tr	Fin	oh god is there an agenda .
tr	Fin	i completely agree .
tr	Fin	My only concern is that we take the boys away from their overwhelming task .

tr	Fin	Please respond to request below .
tr	Fin	He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories - in particular , Real Time Traders .
tr	Fin	If you would , please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening , if possible .
tr	Fin	I ' m at xif you have any questions .
tr	Fin	I understand all of those comparisons , however , the reality is if we lose Dean ( which we will if we don ' t pay 65k + 10k ), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75 - 80k .
tr	Fin	This is pretty easy math for me .
tr	Fin	I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
tr	Fin	Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following :
tr	Fin	Also , the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66k .
tr	Fin	Let me know your thoughts .... then I will run it by Oxley .
tr	Fin	I need to check something in 969 ' s 2000 tax return .
tr	Fin	Who has the 2000 tax return file for 969 ?
tr	Fin	I think that this is for you since I don ' t know any of these people .
tr	Fin	WHY : Today is John ' s last day at EBS .
tr	Fin	This is NOT an Enron - sponsored event .
tr	Fin	Please let me know Monday morning .
tr	Fin	Please see my comments in red below .
tr	Fin	I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group .
tr	Fin	This entity is not in TIS , SAP , nor Hyperion .
tr	Fin	The 2000 tax return has no income , assets , or liabilities .
tr	Fin	There is a corporate data sheet for this company , but this entity seems to have been inactive since it ' s creation .
tr	Fin	Despite the name , this entity appears to be a MTM company .
tr	Fin	Per September financials , this company has about $ 3M of MTM and about $ 8K of expenses , nothing else .
tr	Fin	The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS , and did not get assigned during the reorg .
tr	Fin	Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities , but no I / S items .
tr	Fin	83N is my responsibility .
tr	Fin	I think this entity should stay with 83N .
tr	Fin	So I suggest it be assigned to Leon .
tr	Fin	It should be 4 - easy .
tr	Fin	I think this could go to either Holding / Administrative Companies ( Same as 17H ) or Network & Services ( Leon ).
tr	Fin	Broke out the activities of 1179 .
tr	Fin	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a CFC .
tr	Fin	Broke out the activities of 1307 .
tr	Fin	Let me know if you have any questions .
tr	Fin	I see that it is a 4 , so that will be no problem .
tr	Fin	Please let me know Monday morning .
tr	Fin	Please see my comments in red below .
tr	Fin	I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
tr	Fin	They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection .
tr	Fin	By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent .
tr	Fin	I am interested in several artists .
tr	Fin	I listed all of our ( sometimes mine vs . my wife ' s favorites and priorities ).
tr	Fin	They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
tr	Fin	I want signed and numbered .
tr	Fin	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
tr	Fin	I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive .
tr	Fin	At least that is what I am thinking now .
tr	Fin	By the way , I am interested in re - looking at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that your gallery had a couple of years ago .
tr	Fin	"It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling )."
tr	Fin	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20 , 000 .
tr	Fin	Is there 1 available ?
tr	Fin	Huskers drool over Sooners .

tr	Fin	I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today .
tr	Fin	I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch .
tr	Fin	Actually , I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don ' t be too mad if I have to cancel .
tr	Fin	PS Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games ( when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture . com bowl and that one in Shreveport ( I can ' t remember the name of it )) I realized he is a very , very sick college football fan .
tr	Fin	Jeff , here is the intial draft .
tr	Fin	Please leave as a word document and make any changes and additions that you think necessary .
tr	Fin	Mark , I thought you would enjoy the comment about you .

tr	Fin	We stayed at the Menger and had a great time .
tr	Fin	This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at St . Francis , which may be his new school ( so far , so good ).
tr	Fin	I ' ll be in around1000
tr	Fin	October 19 / 20 , Neil is out of town , so I have to pick Michael up from school ( leave at 430 )
tr	Fin	October 26 / 27 , hope to be vacation time .
tr	Fin	Neil has a meeting in San Antonio ( usually it is in Miami , San Francisco , Phoenix - not so great this year ).
tr	Fin	It is the officer ' s meeting for Enterprise , and spouses are invited .
tr	Fin	This means we won ' t be in town for the Compaq thing .
tr	Fin	Figures , of course .
tr	Fin	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
tr	Fin	We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
tr	Fin	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
tr	Fin	Forget the ONE or more contract questions .
tr	Fin	I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project .
tr	Fin	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :

tr	Fin	On the issue of the contracts , the draft says that the $ 170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed .
tr	Fin	Hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
tr	Fin	2 . The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .
tr	Fin	3 . I expect at least one EPC contract per project .
tr	Fin	FYI , see below .
tr	Fin	Mom ' s birthday is tommorow .
tr	Fin	That is some good stuff .
tr	Fin	I hear you are coming our way soon .
tr	Fin	Look forward to drinking a few beers .
tr	Fin	Yo Mama ` s so fat ....
tr	Fin	Your mama is so fat : When she hauls ass she has to make two trips .
tr	Fin	When she dances she makes the band skip .
tr	Fin	When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her 13 years to live .
tr	Fin	She puts mayonnaise on aspirin . (<- clearly the winner )
tr	Fin	Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard .
tr	Fin	When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts .
tr	Fin	Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph .
tr	Fin	"Her driver ` s license says "" Picture continued on other side ."""
tr	Fin	She has to iron her pants on the driveway .
tr	Fin	The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs .
tr	Fin	"Yo mama ` s so fat , all the restaurants in town have signs that say : "" Maximum Occupancy : 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama "" Yo mama ` s so fat , when she ran away , they had to use all four sides of the milk carton ."
tr	Fin	Yo mama ` s so fat , instead of Levis 501 jeans , she wears Levi ` s 1002 ` s .
tr	Fin	Yo mama ` s so fat , when she gets in an elevator , it HAS to go down .
tr	Fin	Yo mama ` s so fat , she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth .
tr	Fin	Yo mama ` s so fat , she ` s got smaller fat women orbiting around her .
tr	Fin	Yo mama ` s so fat , she could sell shade .
tr	Fin	Expect a call from Paul tonight .
tr	Fin	What are some good interview questions ?
tr	Fin	Poll your co - workers .
tr	Fin	I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn ' t want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis .
tr	Fin	I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say .
tr	Fin	He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality .
tr	Fin	Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive ?
tr	Fin	Don ' t take that deal out until I look at it .
tr	Fin	I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book ( I only wrote it in my red book ).
tr	Fin	Paul called me today .
tr	Fin	He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then .
tr	Fin	Don ' t make Peters and Co . wait .
tr	Fin	Give him a call tommorow .
tr	Fin	I am in the office so give me a call .
tr	Fin	The deed is done .
tr	Fin	Find attached resume and cover letter .
tr	Fin	Dan is really smart and a hard worker .
tr	Fin	I think he would be a good fit .
tr	Fin	Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss ( gone to Kelowna golfing for the weekend ).
tr	Fin	Paul is out of the office today so I haven ' t had a chance to talk to him .
tr	Fin	See you there !
tr	Fin	Ryan Watt says high .
tr	Fin	I will be able to attend .
tr	Fin	We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
tr	Fin	Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
tr	Fin	Late Jan sounds great .
tr	Fin	I believe that these are three weekends in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th .
tr	Fin	Saturday probably works better for me , just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon !!
tr	Fin	Talked to the little mother - to - be .
tr	Fin	She said a shower would be grand .
tr	Fin	She has some big presentation mid - January .
tr	Fin	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Fin	On the means of delivery , I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent .
tr	Fin	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John ' s name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent )?
tr	Fin	Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ?
tr	Fin	With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .
tr	Fin	I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .
tr	Fin	There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report .
tr	Fin	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against .
tr	Fin	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
tr	Fin	Sorry that this response looks so long .
tr	Fin	Since you asked for input , I hope that you don ' t mind that I gave you some .
tr	Fin	Steve , I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21 % year on year ( ie ) $ 13 . 9M from $ 11 . 5M .
tr	Fin	We have been able to keep ENA ' s direct group expenses flat year on year , we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
tr	Fin	Don ' t worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker .
tr	Fin	I just wanted Sue to hear ( she enjoys utility bashing so much ).
tr	Fin	Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is .
tr	Fin	I apologize if I offended anyone .
tr	Fin	Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large , regulated utility in California .
tr	Fin	You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
tr	Fin	I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach .
tr	Fin	See below .
tr	Fin	There are still four important issues , however :
tr	Fin	This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
tr	Fin	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Fin	Please let us know if you have additional questions .
tr	Fin	Are whole offices ( eg Tokyo ) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices ?
tr	Fin	If you have any questions , please call 503 / 464 - 7927 .
tr	Fin	it ' s on tonight
tr	Fin	the deal number is 814014 - why can ' t you see this ?
tr	Fin	If you need any more info , please advise .
tr	Fin	Thank you .

tr	Fin	Don ' t forget about me .
tr	Fin	Also , it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly .
tr	Fin	Steve , everything looks good with one exception .
tr	Fin	The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET - 2 or NET - 284 .
tr	Fin	You review and approve it , keep it on your desk , and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday .

tr	Fin	"I also deleted "" subject to recall "" based on our discussion , assuming you get approval for that revision ."

tr	Fin	If you are not the intended recipient , please contact the sender and delete all copies .
tr	Fin	Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War .
tr	Fin	She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands .
tr	Fin	She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives .
tr	Fin	"Ms . Walters approached one of the women and said , "" This is marvelous ."
tr	Fin	""" Land mines ,"" said the Kuwaiti woman ."
tr	Fin	Cullen and Dykman ( attorneys for Boston Gas Company ) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas .
tr	Fin	"They also made one other change , they are taking out the "" subject to recall "" language at the bottom of page 2 under item # 1 ."
tr	Fin	That would be fun .

tr	Fin	YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOU PLATE , DAD .
tr	Fin	Jack welch is the CEO of GE , not GM .
tr	Fin	"We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "" wish list "" for us ."
tr	Fin	The response was tremendous and , in some cases , very creative .
tr	Fin	Your fellow employees asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush .
tr	Fin	In all , we received requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event .
tr	Fin	We thought you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting , so we ' ve provided a sampling of the suggestions below .
tr	Fin	Here are the top ten most requested eSpeakers .
tr	Fin	If you have any contacts who could help us get in touch with these guest speakers , please let us know at ethink @ enron . com .
tr	Fin	Everybody needs a little help now and then , even eSpeak .
tr	Fin	There were plenty of internal speakers requested , as well .
tr	Fin	Those requests should be somewhat easier to meet , although scheduling time with some of our colleagues can be quite a task !
tr	Fin	Thank you all for your participation .
tr	Fin	7am at Hyatt Regency Downtown would be perfect .

tr	Fin	I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures .
tr	Fin	I ' m very proud of what we ' ve done .

tr	Fin	It will be nice to see you again .
tr	Fin	Please respond to ekrapels @ esaibos . com
tr	Fin	Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold .
tr	Fin	If possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .
tr	Fin	The line in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral .
tr	Fin	The 20 mill reflects gross exposure .
tr	Fin	Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable .
tr	Fin	We too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us .
tr	Fin	I think this would solve our main concern ...
tr	Fin	Please let me know ... we are eager to keep trading with Global and yourselves ...
tr	Fin	Let me know if we need to discuss anything .
tr	Fin	I am hopeful that we are ready to prepare execution copies .
tr	Fin	We look forward to your response .

tr	Fin	Peggy Banczak is the ENA lawyer who handles Mexico .
tr	Fin	Are either of you familiar with this project ?
tr	Fin	Our project manager ( Scott Laidlaw ) and engineer ( Harry Okabayashi ) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work .
tr	Fin	I now understand that someone at ENA / Enron Mexico / Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC contract with ABB for this project .
tr	Fin	I am not in the office today , so please include Renee Alfaro on your response .
tr	Fin	I enjoyed your recent e - mail but was sorry to hear about your dad .
tr	Fin	It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly .
tr	Fin	These are always difficult times .
tr	Fin	As I watched my mother and father ' s health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die , it is a very defining time in our lives .
tr	Fin	But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes .
tr	Fin	Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU .
tr	Fin	I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA .
tr	Fin	They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires .
tr	Fin	They ' re currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami , Florida .
tr	Fin	It was a 7 lb ., 10 oz ., 20 inch little boy .
tr	Fin	So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
tr	Fin	They are a great deal of fun .
tr	Fin	I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston .
tr	Fin	I hope you have a great summer .

tr	Fin	Unfortunately , do to Mr . Lay ' s schedule he will not be able to participate .
tr	Fin	Thank you again ,
tr	Fin	I want to check with Mr . Lay before confirming .
tr	Fin	As you know , our next meeting is on Wednesday , July 12 from 3 : 00 - 5 : 30 p . m .
tr	Fin	There are three possible dates for the meeting , which I suggest be in two parts -- first , a meeting among the panel only from 5 : 00 - 6 : 30 p . m ., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6 : 30 - 8 : 30 p . m .
tr	Fin	Here are the dates :
tr	Fin	Ken said to go ahead and equip it with what you think it should have .
tr	Fin	Please let me know when he can expect to receive it .

tr	Fin	Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation to a reception which they are hosting on Wed . 6 / 14 at 5 : 00 PM to be held at the Houston Petroleum Club .
tr	Fin	I hope that you will be able to attend that event .
tr	Fin	Now it is time to take the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education system .
tr	Fin	This is o . k . for Ken Lay , but we are changing to a more uniform address , so would likely be better to use kenneth . lay @ enron . com .
tr	Fin	"This is a "" test email send "" of the WPO Forum Group from Richard Everett ."
tr	Fin	By return email , please verify that you received this message and let us know if there is another email address that you prefer us to use .

tr	Fin	I had a couple of hickies on my neck the day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns .
tr	Fin	She still has some sort of scholarship but I am not for sure how much it pays .

tr	Fin	She will be 20 on 11 / 03 .
tr	Fin	I am really proud of her .
tr	Fin	Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much .
tr	Fin	I am sure she would like to hear from you .

tr	Fin	Oh , Jeff Sherrar has a new book out .
tr	Fin	Rise to Rebellion .

tr	Fin	Last thing , send me a million dollars , I ' m tired of working .
tr	Fin	I thought we only had cashout , at most 3 times , before this June .

tr	Fin	I need prices for May , June , and July .
tr	Fin	Please respond to Mary . Ellenberger @ enron . com
tr	Fin	I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have .
tr	Fin	Let me know what you think .
tr	Fin	Attached please find the latest enovate risk policy .
tr	Fin	I ' m still at home .
tr	Fin	I ' ll be in tomorrow .
tr	Fin	I have a fax machine at home , though , if you prefer .
tr	Fin	Are you in the office to initial signature pages today ?
tr	Fin	If not , is there someone else that will ?
tr	Fin	I know that Jeff is in Portland .
tr	Fin	If Jeff is happy , I ' m happy .
tr	Fin	I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights .
tr	Fin	His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L . L . C .
tr	Fin	Therefore , I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written .
tr	Fin	I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have .
tr	Fin	Let me know what you think .
tr	Fin	Attached please find the latest enovate risk policy .
tr	Fin	It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn ' t know anything about it and get them to initial it .
tr	Fin	Plus , I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that , instead of having a lawyer she hasn ' t dealt with initial it .
tr	Fin	She is very conscientious about what she signs , and who initials what .
tr	Fin	Is the attached form the final final form ?
tr	Fin	Since it will be Janet signing , it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first .
tr	Fin	Either fax or someone else works fine .
tr	Fin	Let me know which is easier and we can coordinate .
tr	Fin	I ' m still at home .
tr	Fin	I ' ll be in tomorrow .

tr	Fin	It was good to hear from you !
tr	Fin	We had a nice Thanksgiving here too .
tr	Fin	It ' s funny , because usually it ' s just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia doesn ' t really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me !), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
tr	Fin	It was good having the girls down .
tr	Fin	"We played a new version of Uno called "" African Uno "" that was complex , fast and at times , physically challenging ."
tr	Fin	It ' s not for the meek .
tr	Fin	It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
tr	Fin	She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses ( when you play you ' ll see why you can know everyone elses hands !).
tr	Fin	I expect Craig didn ' t want Mom to see his place because it was messy .
tr	Fin	I think compared to my house , he ' s embarrased about his apartment .
tr	Fin	And his apartment is so run down down I ' m afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby .
tr	Fin	I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
tr	Fin	"The upstairs "" guest suite "" is pretty neat ."
tr	Fin	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Fin	But , I guess , it ' s a start ...
tr	Fin	I leave the evening of the 21st , my flight comes in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am .
tr	Fin	It ' s good chatting with you .
tr	Fin	Keep in touch !
tr	Fin	Anyway , I got you message , and I got the World Series thing ( although I had already received
tr	Fin	Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving , I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I ' ve ever had ( I not gonna tell them that , I don ' t want them getting swell heads ).
tr	Fin	Ma said she had a great time in Houston , She was happy to see yourself , as well as C & D .
tr	Fin	I think she likes her special room in your house .
tr	Fin	Love ya .
tr	Fin	"See our web page at "" http :// www . radianz . com"
tr	Fin	Let me know if the notice information is OK with you .
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure you have the authority to sign documents w / o special authority ...
tr	Fin	"With respect to Deutsche Bank ("""" DB ""), we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
tr	Fin	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co - signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we ' re OK .
tr	Fin	Thank you ,
tr	Fin	As much fun as they are , I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them .
tr	Fin	But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
tr	Fin	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Fin	Anyway , I ' m sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
tr	Fin	Things in Houston are good and definitely warm .
tr	Fin	"I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" Rent "" and it was wonderful ."
tr	Fin	Talk to you guys soon ,
tr	Fin	A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul .
tr	Fin	Are you really ?
tr	Fin	I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
tr	Fin	Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what ' s going on in Houston .
tr	Fin	Take care ,
tr	Fin	Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo ! Messenger .
tr	Fin	The play was very good and I think well received .
tr	Fin	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling ).
tr	Fin	I caught the third day of Corey ' s Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job !).
tr	Fin	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Fin	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went .
tr	Fin	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they ' d make a good match ?
tr	Fin	She ' s a very fun girl .
tr	Fin	Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch .
tr	Fin	How was the play ?
tr	Fin	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Fin	I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
tr	Fin	I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully .
tr	Fin	However , having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors .
tr	Fin	Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have established , I have the memory of an elephant ).
tr	Fin	Now back to what ' s really important ... you .
tr	Fin	Thought you ' d like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec . 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it ' s all about you and your needs .
tr	Fin	I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam both written and on the rode .
tr	Fin	This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire .
tr	Fin	I know I need some of your organizational skills .
tr	Fin	How ' s life on 32 today -- well that ' s enough about you let ' s talk more about me .
tr	Fin	There is no pleasure in having nothing to do ; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it .
tr	Fin	"Note that the No "" Out "" version requires us to pay the premium on Tuesday !"
tr	Fin	As we discussed , the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue :
tr	Fin	Please call if you want to discuss .
tr	Fin	Have a good weekend .
tr	Fin	If you are not the intended recipient , please delete the e - mail and notify us immediately .
tr	Fin	Is there anyone else we should tell ?
tr	Fin	fyi ... it sound like Bobby is in serious condition .
tr	Fin	I think they ' ll send us another update once he ' s out of emergency and into a room .?
tr	Fin	Then it ' s real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number .? The address is below .?
tr	Fin	Thought you might like to know .
tr	Fin	Jann , phoned this morning and asked me to pass this information to the group , concerning Bobby Riggins .
tr	Fin	Bobby is a member of a bicycle team , while cycling this weekend , he and other members of his team were injured by a truck .?
tr	Fin	There was one death in the injured group and the others with major injuries .?
tr	Fin	Bobby is one of those with major injuries .?
tr	Fin	He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub Hospital .?
tr	Fin	Keep Bobby , his team members and their families in your prayers .
tr	Fin	I think it ' s a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ).
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually , I ' m sure I don ' t have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me .
tr	Fin	We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL implementation .
tr	Fin	Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with more than one of you in one place .
tr	Fin	Thank you
tr	Fin	Argentina intend to press ahead even given the concern about taxes , etc .
tr	Fin	They wish to launch on Sept . 1 - meaning we will need to be sending mailings sometime around mid - August .
tr	Fin	Just wanted to know were we stand on the ETA and PA for Argentina ?
tr	Fin	If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
tr	Fin	Is that what you want ?
tr	Fin	To make matters even more confusing , there are two Mark Taylors .
tr	Fin	I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI ( based in London ).
tr	Fin	Ineos is an English company which has a majority of its operations in the US .
tr	Fin	Note that the credit thresholds are in US $, but the MACS are designated in British Pounds .
tr	Fin	Please send the draft to Troy Black and he will forward to the CP .
tr	Fin	Please deliver a copy to me as well .
tr	Fin	Have a great weekend .
tr	Fin	I left you a voice mail on Friday .
tr	Fin	I looked at the UEComm Master and had some comments -- such as our name is wrong , the cross default threshold for us should be US $ and not AUD , and there were a few other questions I had .
tr	Fin	Please find attached the Enron Master Agreement .
tr	Fin	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call .
tr	Fin	Turn up your sound a bit .

tr	Fin	Hope you ' ve been storing up sleep , cause it looks like you won ' t be getting much for a while .
tr	Fin	Take care

tr	Fin	Thanks , I know you are busy .
tr	Fin	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else .
tr	Fin	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
tr	Fin	Let me know if one of you could help me do this .
tr	Fin	Evidently , this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now .
tr	Fin	There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value .
tr	Fin	I believe that there might be a sign - flipping problem for PUTS that ' s causing this whole issue .
tr	Fin	Karim - this ' s likely the explanation to your other question ...
tr	Fin	Shouldn ' t all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative ( representing positive liquidation ) for the puts ?
tr	Fin	The liq value for the call is CORRECT .

tr	Fin	It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend .
tr	Fin	This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph ( c ) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement .
tr	Fin	It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on , and you probably didn ' t see them at first .
tr	Fin	I didn ' t either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up .
tr	Fin	I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives , and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London .
tr	Fin	I communicated that to Bob Bowen .
tr	Fin	He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business .
tr	Fin	i ' m a gas trader on the west desk and one of my customers had some issues with our electronic trading agreement .

tr	Fin	Consequently I need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the following :

tr	Fin	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year .
tr	Fin	I understand how competitive the process has become , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , personality , extracurricular activities , etc . that this would compensate for my disability .
tr	Fin	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Fin	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level .
tr	Fin	I also plan on retaking the GMAT test .
tr	Fin	Due to my disability , this will be a monumental task ; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business .
tr	Fin	Take care and hope to hear from you soon .
tr	Fin	In the end , the results were not favorable .

tr	Fin	I am very interested in energy - finance and think that your idea is a very good .

tr	Fin	Let me know if you have any questions .
tr	Fin	Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see associated with the heat rate spread option .
tr	Fin	I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
tr	Fin	As such , please provide the following detail :
tr	Fin	Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/ MWh to value the deal ?
tr	Fin	Yvan , and Ben , please provide answers to these question via written correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding .
tr	Fin	Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far .
tr	Fin	This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .
tr	Fin	Randy , this is the issue I left you the voice mail on .
tr	Fin	"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to "" work in good faith with CDEC "" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC ' s system ."
tr	Fin	"We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "" assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses "" associated with the manual system ."
tr	Fin	In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .
tr	Fin	That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS , but it that ' s what they are saying , let me know and we can figure out a solution .
tr	Fin	Good point , but I ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .
tr	Fin	None of them did , and most importantly , the winning bidders did not .
tr	Fin	Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates .
tr	Fin	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?
tr	Fin	After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we ' ve done .
tr	Fin	If there are any objections you need to get back to me ASAP .
tr	Fin	pls print .
tr	Fin	In discussion with Dave , we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers .
tr	Fin	However , as you will see , the questions I thought of got kinda long - but I think we need answers for all of them .
tr	Fin	Please provide me your thoughts asap .
tr	Fin	Here it is .
tr	Fin	Here is the attachment ...
tr	Fin	It incorporates Mr . Stojic ' s and Mr . Kelly ' s initial comments .
tr	Fin	Please review it and let me know if you have any comments on or before Tuesday afternoon ( I will be out of the office Monday ).
tr	Fin	Thank you !
tr	Fin	Please approve Susan ' s attached expense report and forward to accounting with a cc : to me .
tr	Fin	Forgot to cc you .
tr	Fin	Please approve Susan ' s attached expense report and forward to accounting with a cc : to me .
tr	Fin	Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair ( she only wanted one , however ).
tr	Fin	Many people at Enron already have this type of chair , but we rarely , if ever , have a surplus because they are so popular .
tr	Fin	The cost is $ 567 . 77 per chair plus tax .
tr	Fin	Please approve the purchase of two .
tr	Fin	sorry , i left lou off of the message .

tr	Fin	I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM ' s spies intercepted .
tr	Fin	She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him .
tr	Fin	Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer ' s duplicity , but after tempers cooled , MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response .
tr	Fin	Yea -- it was outstanding news !
tr	Fin	Who is responsible for completing all paperwork for entering a new market ?
tr	Fin	Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC ?
tr	Fin	( Please visit our newly updated website www . caem . org for more information on the DISCO Forum .)
tr	Fin	If you should decide to arrange lodging at a different hotel , please do so quickly as there is limited availability in all surrounding hotels .
tr	Fin	If you have any questions or require any assistance at all , please contact Hope Duncan at 202 . 739 . 0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703 . 729 . 2710 .
tr	Fin	Is this correct ?
tr	Fin	Linda Robertson says they should be charged to Jim Steffes ' cost center , etc .
tr	Fin	Let me know .
tr	Fin	I ' m in all week .
tr	Fin	Please disregard and destroy the form you received on July 2 , as well as any blank forms retrieved from the PEP system prior to that date .
tr	Fin	Please use the attached for Associate and Analyst evaluations .
tr	Fin	We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
tr	Fin	The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue , providing specific examples and proposing the solution .
tr	Fin	Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
tr	Fin	Thane and I also visited with him .
tr	Fin	Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed .
tr	Fin	( Even though he has bigger things to do in D . C ., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas , the repercussions could be global .)
tr	Fin	There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th .
tr	Fin	Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt . Governor , there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions .
tr	Fin	Thane is in Austin on Friday , but is available by phone .
tr	Fin	I will be on a plane to Houston at 8 : 00 a . m .
tr	Fin	Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9 : 30 until 3 : 00 .
tr	Fin	I am available after Rick ' s Friday budget meeting ... are you available then ?
tr	Fin	You are right , we do need a formal plan , Thane has started an initial draft .
tr	Fin	Walking out last night , Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets .
tr	Fin	Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes .
tr	Fin	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Fin	As important , the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market .
tr	Fin	Let ' s get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference .
tr	Fin	Jean and Thane , I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation .
tr	Fin	I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick ' s budget meeting .
tr	Fin	We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order , filing , etc . with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information .
tr	Fin	Many details remain to be worked out , but we will keep you advised .
tr	Fin	I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston .
tr	Fin	Please , let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization .
tr	Fin	I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview .
tr	Fin	I enjoyed your presentation , and meeting you briefly afterwards , at the SIAM Workshop last Friday .
tr	Fin	I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and development of modeling and simulation software products , mostly for the oil and gas pipeline industry .
tr	Fin	Please consider whether I might fit in your group .
tr	Fin	Your answer to a question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for .
tr	Fin	Also , please let me know , by email , the names and contact information of other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with my qualifications in their group .
tr	Fin	Publications are available on request .
tr	Fin	Thank you for your time .
tr	Fin	Sorry I guess I didn ' t read it very well .
tr	Fin	It ' s ok with me .
tr	Fin	Contact Cindy Stark to make an appointment .
tr	Fin	Thought since I will be in Houston , stop by your office for few minutes .
tr	Fin	What is the subject matter you wish to visit about ?
tr	Fin	I will be in Houston on May 11th and would like to visit with you in early afternoon if possible .
tr	Fin	Please let me know what time would work for you .
tr	Fin	I figured this posting belonged to one of you .
tr	Fin	Please see the message from Danny Jones .
tr	Fin	This is ok by me .
tr	Fin	Rick looks like a good candidate .
tr	Fin	Please forward your comments or questions as soon as possible .
tr	Fin	These seats are in Section 104 , Row D , Seats 1 - 4 .
tr	Fin	Please let me know if you are interested in any of these games .
tr	Fin	Took me a little longer to review and revise Adam ' s first drafts than I had thought ( there ' s a lot going on here , as you ' ll see soon ).
tr	Fin	I expect to send them out to you sometime tomorrow .
tr	Fin	Since Debbie is a client too , I think I ' ll just mail them to your home unless you prefer otherwise .
tr	Fin	Please contact Sherri Sera ( 713 / 853 - 5984 ) or Bill Dorsey ( 713 / 646 - 6505 ) for the weekly dial - in number and passcode .

tr	Fin	Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see .
tr	Fin	It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
tr	Fin	There ' s a new EOL Counterparty listed in the UK .
tr	Fin	Please respond .
tr	Fin	Please see attached .
tr	Fin	are you the right lawyer to look at this ?

tr	Fin	"We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include , "" a division of Cargill Incorporated ""."
tr	Fin	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Fin	The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty ' s name from Global Counterparty .
tr	Fin	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
tr	Fin	That is the source of Tana ' s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
tr	Fin	Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub - to - Legal Link to Cargill , Inc . per GCP procedure .
tr	Fin	Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Fin	This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename .
tr	Fin	Please review the process below :

tr	Fin	I ' ll be in town through Sunday morning .
tr	Fin	I am in mediation .
tr	Fin	I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher , as well , just to make sure it is handled .
tr	Fin	My schedule shows an afternoon session .
tr	Fin	I got this .
tr	Fin	I assume this is 12 : 30 Central Time ?
tr	Fin	Here is the overview of Bob Henderson ' s Employment Agreement .
tr	Fin	Michelle , please comment .
tr	Fin	Please send me an email response about whether you and Michelle Cash are OK with what he ' s written .
tr	Fin	After a conversation with Ryan Seleznov I herewith like disclose in writing my intentions in respect to Dealbench .
tr	Fin	Please see attached Word file
tr	Fin	Please see the attached .
tr	Fin	Please send David Lund copies of our standard corporate services agreement and the standard assignment letter ( use Bridgeline example -- with and without non - compete ).
tr	Fin	Here are the sample Agreements .
tr	Fin	Please let us know if you need anything else .
tr	Fin	I agree also , but I don ' t know all the parties or complications involved .
tr	Fin	I agree with what the concern is below .
tr	Fin	We have GIS ids , and Eid ( external id - just like GIS id ).
tr	Fin	I think we should try to migrate to one of these .
tr	Fin	Please let me know what type of statement I should make back to the customer .
tr	Fin	Per my voicemail message , please review the note below .
tr	Fin	Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information .
tr	Fin	I am very concerned about this issue .
tr	Fin	I have the following suggestion for our company .
tr	Fin	This will be safer for all employees .
tr	Fin	For example , I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number .
tr	Fin	Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number .
tr	Fin	Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting .
tr	Fin	The Leads who are responsible for Associates are as follows :
tr	Fin	If anyone has any questions on the above please let me know .
tr	Fin	Shanna , I spoke with Per tonight about this .
tr	Fin	Let ' s talk tomorrow .
tr	Fin	This is the background to my conversation with Shanna .
tr	Fin	I have a copy of the document I can give to you tomorrow .
tr	Fin	John , Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions .
tr	Fin	I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur .
tr	Fin	Thank you
tr	Fin	Let ' s discuss exactly what is involved here -- confidentiality , etc .
tr	Fin	I wanted to let you know about this before I respond to her request .
tr	Fin	Let me know if you have any questions .
tr	Fin	Kathy McMahon suggested that I contact you in an effort to gather information on : Enron ' s Affirmative Action Policy and plans ; as well as demographic analysis of workforce ( gender , age , ethnic origin , nationality )
tr	Fin	Please let me know at your earliest convience if you can help me .
tr	Fin	please print all these for me .
tr	Fin	Try this .
tr	Fin	We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth , Florida project as well .
tr	Fin	Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work .
tr	Fin	In that respect , we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team .
tr	Fin	I think the first step is a call between yourself , me , Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero .
tr	Fin	Barbara , please organize a call for Mike , Michelle , Mark Stubley and me .
tr	Fin	Apparently the City informed them that no permit is required .
tr	Fin	Mike Indivero , I understand that Mr . Mike Croall ' s release date from NEPCO is Oct 31 , 2001 .
tr	Fin	Please advise as to who his replacement is and their report date .
tr	Fin	Sara , trading is still not settled .
tr	Fin	Thank you for the invitaion to the conference call .
tr	Fin	I assume we should come over EB .
tr	Fin	Could
tr	Fin	I have a conference call this afternoon at 3 pm ( Houston time ) with Antonio Felix de Araujo Cintra from the Tozzini firm regarding further research on derivative products for trading in Brazil .
tr	Fin	If you would like to participate in person or by conference , please let me know .
tr	Fin	I will be in Sao Paulo from Sept 20 - 22 and Buenos Aires from Sept 23 - 24 .
tr	Fin	Let me know if you would like to participate in any way .
tr	Fin	please try to verify .
tr	Fin	How about Friday , Sept . 17 , at 9 am ( Houston time ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) time ?
tr	Fin	Please advise .
tr	Fin	NOTICE : This message is confidential .
tr	Fin	If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system ; you should not copy this message or disclose its contents to anyone .
tr	Fin	Thank you .
tr	Fin	Please let me know if you would like for me to conference you in .
tr	Fin	If you would like this executed , please let me know .
tr	Fin	Looks good .
tr	Fin	Dan : please see if the attached draft works .
tr	Fin	My extension is 35620 .
tr	Fin	If you think any other pertinent information could be included , please feel free to add it .
tr	Fin	I e - mailed your assistant earlier this morning and have had no response .
tr	Fin	Please advise .
tr	Fin	If anyone would like to be conferenced in or attend in person , please let me know .
tr	Fin	It ' s a good starting point .
tr	Fin	"Other "" guidelines "" exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia ."
tr	Fin	I ' m not exactly certain as to what you are looking for .
tr	Fin	Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US ( although LA . is about as close as you can get to a third world country ).
tr	Fin	Let me know how I can help further .
tr	Fin	Here it is -- we printed this 2 - sided and laminated it .
tr	Fin	see below .
tr	Fin	It looks like the 2 - day L / C issue is an issue .
tr	Fin	Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original .
tr	Fin	He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight .
tr	Fin	Hope you ' ll have time to review it today .
tr	Fin	Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5 ) and the new l / c wording ( drops the 2 day period to replace an l / c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay ).
tr	Fin	I know we talked about these issues earlier , but Tiger ' s lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing , even if we are the one ' s issuing the gtee and l / c .
tr	Fin	Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help .
tr	Fin	There is an outside chance we could have everything set to go this week .
tr	Fin	I ' m fine in Texas , still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe , working hard , etc .
tr	Fin	As for me , well , I lead the simple life , own a little house in West University , own a little car ( I had to buy a new one recently - the 14 - year old 380 SE started scaring me a bit ), you know , the usual .
tr	Fin	How ' s your family ?
tr	Fin	This weekend I ' m off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires on business .
tr	Fin	Hope all is well .
tr	Fin	Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines ( physical and financial ) for the London traders .
tr	Fin	Thank you for your help .
tr	Fin	Sara , here are the trader guidelines I developed for UK gas , UK power and Nordic power .
tr	Fin	I assume you need both gas and power .
tr	Fin	These are to some extent country or market specific .
tr	Fin	Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines ( physical and financial ) for the London traders .
tr	Fin	Thank you for your help .
tr	Fin	Please review the attached memo to verify that I have identified all of the products that you are interested in trading in Brazil .
tr	Fin	I will be in Sao Paulo on Monday , September 20 , 1999 .
tr	Fin	Thank you ,
tr	Fin	Thank you for your patience and I hope you can take a few moments to enjoy the holidays .
tr	Fin	Note that this communication is confidential , covered by CA ' s settlement rules .
tr	Fin	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Fin	As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
tr	Fin	* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *
tr	Fin	* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *
tr	Fin	* Offers a 7 . 5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
tr	Fin	* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ). *
tr	Fin	* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3 . 5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
tr	Fin	* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *
tr	Fin	* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *
tr	Fin	* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .
tr	Fin	PG & E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today ' s mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
tr	Fin	We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback .
tr	Fin	The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal , an Attachment ( a copy of PG & E ' s proposed Gas Rule 27 ), and a set of supporting workpapers .
tr	Fin	"Finally , please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in "" Word 2000 "" format ."
tr	Fin	We would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of Word , upon request by individual Parties .
tr	Fin	We look forward to seeing you on January 10 - 11 .
tr	Fin	In the meantime , we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season .
tr	Fin	Thank you .
tr	Fin	Our time is likely to be limited to 5 - 10 minutes .
tr	Fin	Code is 80435 .
tr	Fin	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).
tr	Fin	Our time is likely to be limited to 5 - 10 minutes .
tr	Fin	Code is 80435 .
tr	Fin	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).
tr	Fin	That ' s a very good point .
tr	Fin	"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
tr	Fin	In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
tr	Fin	Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .
tr	Fin	We ' re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
tr	Fin	But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .
tr	Fin	"The administration is hell bent on finding a "" fall guy ."""
tr	Fin	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
tr	Fin	"His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "" refunds ."""
tr	Fin	On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .
tr	Fin	And Carl Wood ' s remarks were extreme .
tr	Fin	At the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked arms in calling for refunds .
tr	Fin	"Bilbray joined the "" gouging "" band wagon ."
tr	Fin	"The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "" real "" investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works ."
tr	Fin	On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
tr	Fin	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Fin	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Fin	IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
tr	Fin	"In the best case , the clamoring for a "" refund "" subsides ."
tr	Fin	In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .
tr	Fin	"In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) "" played by the rules ,"" but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers ."
tr	Fin	You ' re right , Sue .
tr	Fin	Harry also had a good comment --- don ' t specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
tr	Fin	This is a request for your interview participation .
tr	Fin	The Associate and Analyst Programs will be on the Penn , undergraduate campus interviewing summer Analyst interns next week .
tr	Fin	Currently , I need three interviewers for Thursday , March 1st and one interviewer for Friday , March 2nd .
tr	Fin	Please let me know of your availability .
tr	Fin	As always , thank you for your time and please contact me @ ext 58369 if you have any questions .
tr	Fin	Please don ' t mention my NY trip to anyone .
tr	Fin	Keep in touch .
tr	Fin	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40 , 000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
tr	Fin	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Fin	please print
tr	Fin	Please address , and I ' ll check with Legal as well .
tr	Fin	We typically only book deals when everything is signed off .
tr	Fin	these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .
tr	Fin	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Fin	seems like a 5 second decision to me .
tr	Fin	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Fin	please print
tr	Fin	Thank you very much for your quick reply .
tr	Fin	I highlight the relevant skills in the summary .
tr	Fin	The position is with the EES MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE , RETAIL & COMM , ENRON ENERGY SERVICES .
tr	Fin	Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions .
tr	Fin	That girl ' s mother sounds like a real problem .
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure how I would have handled it .
tr	Fin	What happened ?
tr	Fin	Here ' s a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7 : 35am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I ' d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
tr	Fin	It was now , 8 : 15 and there was no sign of her bus .
tr	Fin	On top of things , I had quiz at 8am .
tr	Fin	Which I then realized I missed .
tr	Fin	I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own .
tr	Fin	I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts .
tr	Fin	I called her grandmother and explained things to her .
tr	Fin	A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her , but I couldn ' t do it .
tr	Fin	Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8 : 30am ).
tr	Fin	There were only 15 minutes left of class .
tr	Fin	I stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
tr	Fin	After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived .
tr	Fin	I told the bus driver where to drop her off .
tr	Fin	I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure .
tr	Fin	And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe .
tr	Fin	Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well .
tr	Fin	I spoke to her prior to my note .
tr	Fin	Is there anyone else in EGM that could participate ?
tr	Fin	Please let me know .
tr	Fin	Jen , please take care of this for EGM
tr	Fin	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
tr	Fin	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Fin	We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9am - 12pm ) or afternoon ( 2pm - 5pm ) complete session .
tr	Fin	Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date .
tr	Fin	Thank you ,
tr	Fin	This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick reactions and favourable market movements .
tr	Fin	Jen , please take care of this for EGM
tr	Fin	"2 . In Section 3 . 1 , in the last sentence after the proviso insert "" a "" before the word "" change "" and after the word "" in ""."
tr	Fin	3 . In Section 6 . 1 , change 20 Business Days to 20 days .
tr	Fin	Also , add a semicolon at the end of clause ( i ).
tr	Fin	"6 . Capitalize the word "" facility "" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor ."
tr	Fin	7 . Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6 . 2 . 1 .
tr	Fin	"Also , in the 7th line of the reps add the word "" into "" after the word "" entered "" and before the word "" this ""."
tr	Fin	11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I ' m not sure exists .
tr	Fin	"In clause ( e ), delete the "" s "": from the word consolidation ."
tr	Fin	13 . In UCC / Disclaimer of warranties , add a clause ( c ).
tr	Fin	Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
tr	Fin	Please note the following as you review :
tr	Fin	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Fin	"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs )."
tr	Fin	Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched .
tr	Fin	"P . S . Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "" hiatus "" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7 / 16 ."
tr	Fin	Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of the language that makes the LC transferable .
tr	Fin	Are you okay with that ?
tr	Fin	If so , are we ready to execute ?
tr	Fin	I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions .
tr	Fin	In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form , I think you should add a forward contract rep .
tr	Fin	He needs more info about these trades ( i . e ., price info ) and would like to talk with you about it .
tr	Fin	His number is 860 - 665 - 2368 and e - mail address is leporjj @ selectenergy . com .
tr	Fin	Here ' s everything that flows from 5 / 1 / 01 forward .
tr	Fin	We need to include all outstanding transactions .
tr	Fin	Just let me know and I can send you a new attachment .
tr	Fin	I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
tr	Fin	I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we ' re all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
tr	Fin	Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week .
tr	Fin	It is Enpower No . 295870 .
tr	Fin	It is Enpower No . 295870 .
tr	Fin	It is Enpower No . 295870 .
tr	Fin	Are we ready to execute ?
tr	Fin	I am out of the office today but will be back tomorrow .
tr	Fin	Please call me .
tr	Fin	It simply refers to the same ICC publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit generally .
tr	Fin	Is there some specific concern that we can address ?
tr	Fin	Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
tr	Fin	Were there any ?
tr	Fin	Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar .
tr	Fin	I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft .
tr	Fin	It is a fairly standard , fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar .
tr	Fin	If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments , please give me a call .
tr	Fin	We hope to execute this Agreement this week .
tr	Fin	If you have any comments , please let me know .
tr	Fin	Our in - service date is May 1 .
tr	Fin	If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts / materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events , please let me know .

tr	Fin	Ticket price was $ 1 , 183 per ticket .
tr	Fin	Paul and Judy are on board .
tr	Fin	Janell and Dennis will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to Janell ' s broken leg .
tr	Fin	John , sorry for the late response , but I think you can implement immediately .
tr	Fin	I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed ( I don ' t remember if you were there or not ) but I ' m thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great , thanks !
tr	Fin	The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use , I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps . to use for updates .
tr	Fin	I was aware .
tr	Fin	The new Hotline phone number is 713 - 853 - 3044 .
tr	Fin	I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation , TK was also made aware .

tr	Fin	See the attached spreadsheet .
tr	Fin	Let me know if you have any questions .
tr	Fin	These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago .
tr	Fin	Are you comfortable with the difference ?
tr	Fin	This difference is mainly due to the following :
tr	Fin	Please call me at x36709 if there are questions
tr	Fin	Monday ' s are always tough .
tr	Fin	Please review and let me know what you think .
tr	Fin	Let ' s talk before I leave town next Wednesday .
tr	Fin	Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday .
tr	Fin	If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and / or send me their resume .
tr	Fin	See you Sunday .
tr	Fin	Let ' s discuss .
tr	Fin	The in - service date of May 1 , will be very difficult to attain .
tr	Fin	Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ).
tr	Fin	These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect .
tr	Fin	Questar may be able to purchase material , but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery .
tr	Fin	The I / C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100 % of design ).
tr	Fin	If you have questions or issues , please let me know .
tr	Fin	Our in - service date is May 1 .
tr	Fin	If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts / materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events , please let me know .
tr	Fin	"Listening to the Edison call w / investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("" big bang "" approach ) sometime in Q1 ' 02 ."
tr	Fin	Figured they ' d contacted them , but wanted to make sure .
tr	Fin	You know when the meeting with schedulers will be ?
tr	Fin	I apologize , I ' m on the road and haven ' t heard when that will be .
tr	Fin	Thanks for the info - a few people from our shop will be in attendance ./
tr	Fin	Electricity : A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president .
tr	Fin	Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state ' s energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis , pushed the state into the power - buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers .
tr	Fin	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Fin	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Fin	""" I don ' t know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort ,"" said Dunn ."
tr	Fin	"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter ."
tr	Fin	""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis ,"" Maviglio said ."
tr	Fin	Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .
tr	Fin	ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn ' s committee will find no criminal conduct .
tr	Fin	""" It was an emergency ,"" Fishman said ."
tr	Fin	""" We had to take action .''"
tr	Fin	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct . 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .
tr	Fin	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Fin	""" All hell broke loose .''"
tr	Fin	Records show that on Oct . 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .
tr	Fin	""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity ,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III ."
tr	Fin	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .
tr	Fin	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Fin	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Fin	The generators got their way .
tr	Fin	The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .
tr	Fin	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they couldn ' t make a profit even under these constraints .
tr	Fin	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Fin	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Fin	Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .
tr	Fin	Neither the ISO board , which had established the price cap , nor the governor learned of Winter ' s actions until the cap had been removed .
tr	Fin	In fact , the attorney who helped draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made .
tr	Fin	""" In retrospect , we should have told them ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Fin	With the price caps gone , the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs .
tr	Fin	""" The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor ' s key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment ,'' Maviglio said ."
tr	Fin	""" It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant ."
tr	Fin	"This action accelerated the utilities ' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power - buying business ."""
tr	Fin	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO records show .
tr	Fin	Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $ 30 billion .
tr	Fin	Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians .
tr	Fin	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .
tr	Fin	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .
tr	Fin	""" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Fin	"We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund ."""
tr	Fin	Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .
tr	Fin	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Fin	""" Terry did this by himself ,'' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
tr	Fin	""" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing ."""
tr	Fin	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Fin	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed , but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos , the governor ' s spokesman Maviglio said .
tr	Fin	James J . Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter .
tr	Fin	""" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark ,'' Hoecker said ."
tr	Fin	""" They ( ISO management ) did what any independent system operator would do ."""
tr	Fin	What Dunn ' s committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired .
tr	Fin	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Fin	""" We don ' t know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out ,"" Dunn said ."
tr	Fin	""" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact .''"
tr	Fin	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .
tr	Fin	Sounds good .
tr	Fin	"I suggest a "" blind draw "" on the teams , best ball not scramble on the golf , and as for the wager , no emails from the losing team for one week !"
tr	Fin	Is there any question ?
tr	Fin	As I recall , Montavano , Shapiro and I usually make up one team , but I ' m willing to switch around a bit .
tr	Fin	And if yes , what ' s the game and wager ???
tr	Fin	It ' s a two way street , of course .
tr	Fin	There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation , but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show .
tr	Fin	"Where is the "" simple "" explanation of the transportation piece ?"
tr	Fin	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Fin	What say ye ?
tr	Fin	Looks good

tr	Fin	If so , please contact Michelle .
tr	Fin	Justin , I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here .
tr	Fin	We sued Houston Casualty last year but I don ' t recall making any bad faith claims .
tr	Fin	It settled anyway , a long time ago .
tr	Fin	I guess the questions on which I should like your steer are : ( a ) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference to bad faith proceedings made by United India ?
tr	Fin	( b ) Is it right that Enron has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas ?
tr	Fin	( c ) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you ?

tr	Fin	We are still very interested in having Enron support our eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol .?
tr	Fin	The real purpose of my call , however , is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational statements of the Protocol .
tr	Fin	I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association ' s dispute management systems and services for eCommerce B2B transactions .?

tr	Fin	We are hopeful that we can post the complaint to the UCAN web site later today .

tr	Fin	the industry of Marriage and Kids , you heard me .
tr	Fin	Marriage is , in and of itself , a noble concept , but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck .
tr	Fin	How can I say such an abomination , ask you ?
tr	Fin	Look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating , yet they do .
tr	Fin	These are the people who keep Jerry springer on the air .
tr	Fin	These are the kids who will destroy society , because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture , you heard again .
tr	Fin	Not so , Kids are what kids are and will do what they do .
tr	Fin	It ' s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
tr	Fin	Very few parents do this .
tr	Fin	And this is a direct result of the Politically correct , permissive , time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this .
tr	Fin	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .
tr	Fin	Look inside yourselves parents , is this you ?
tr	Fin	Probably it is .
tr	Fin	Fuck you .

tr	Fin	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Fin	"Now , NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with "" go "" fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches ."
tr	Fin	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
tr	Fin	I hope so .
tr	Fin	A few weeks ago , shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry .
tr	Fin	One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed .
tr	Fin	"The other is a new fuel tank "" guaranteed "" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation ."
tr	Fin	NASA has some PR hurdles to overcome in the future .
tr	Fin	But lets hope for their sake ( and the sake of all space lovers out there ) that they can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again .
tr	Fin	"In George Orwell ' s influential novel "" 1984 "" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "" war is peace ""."
tr	Fin	I see the merit in flowing with duality .
tr	Fin	Think of all life , if you will , as one great choir or one grand congregation .
tr	Fin	Our strength is in our unity and harmony .
tr	Fin	Any major dischord and we all suffer .
tr	Fin	Any insult to the collective good brings us all down .
tr	Fin	We are only as strong as our weakest , we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager .
tr	Fin	When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down .
tr	Fin	There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
tr	Fin	Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him .
tr	Fin	If we are all in this thing together , let ' s play nice .
tr	Fin	Remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else , remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny .
tr	Fin	There is no health without peace and no peace without health .

tr	Fin	We now present the kaoshikii dance , which is excellent before and after yoga postures .
tr	Fin	I encourage you to do this dance , as it has tremendous positive effects .
tr	Fin	It is a dance for both males and females .
tr	Fin	Kaoshikii is a dance which was invented in 1978 by Shrii Shrii A ' nandamu ' rti .
tr	Fin	It is a psycho - spiritual exercise and benefiting the mind by developing stamina and strength .
tr	Fin	Kaoshikii is especially good for women .
tr	Fin	Kaoshikii comes from the Sanskrit word ' kosa ' meaning shell or layer of mind .
tr	Fin	The self of the individual lies hidden in the innermost layers of existence ( kosas ).
tr	Fin	Thus kaoshikii is a blossoming of the microcosm ( unit being ) in its attempt to attain a link with the Macrocosm ( Cosmic Consciousness ).
tr	Fin	Exercises all the glands and limbs from head to toes .
tr	Fin	Increases longevity .

tr	Fin	First the dancer begins in the starting position : the hands together and raised over the head .
tr	Fin	"Then to the beat of "" dhin , dhin ,... , ta ', ta '"", the dancers begin their step , placing the big toe behind the heel of the other foot ."
tr	Fin	In the final two steps , the dancers firmly stamp their feet on the ground .
tr	Fin	Here is the ideation .
tr	Fin	"The two hands when upraised and folded together represent : "" Now I am trying to establish a link with Parama Purus ' a ( Supreme Consciousness )."""
tr	Fin	"Bending to the right indicates : "" I know the right way to request You ."""
tr	Fin	"Bending to the left indicates : "" I know how to fulfil Your demands ."""
tr	Fin	"Bending forward suggests : "" I completely surrender to You ."""
tr	Fin	"Bending backward represents : "" I am ready to face all obstacles that may come ."""

tr	Fin	Quebecker wins U . S . bravery award
tr	Fin	Dr . Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que ., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two friends who were being mauled .
tr	Fin	""" All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [ River ] valley where we were canoeing ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Fin	Dr . Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
tr	Fin	""" My first thought was to push it away ,"" he said ."
tr	Fin	""" A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear ' s paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling ."""
tr	Fin	The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears .
tr	Fin	The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack , experts said .
tr	Fin	The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
tr	Fin	""" Their screams changed ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Fin	""" I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out ."""
tr	Fin	The bear dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 Mr . Parenteau , knocking him to the ground , he said .
tr	Fin	Dr . Fortier threw a large rock at the bear , distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , who was in the same tent .
tr	Fin	Again Dr . Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
tr	Fin	""" The bear gave chase and I gave chase ,"" he said ."
tr	Fin	""" At some point , Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back ."
tr	Fin	"I was beside the bear ' s head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times ."""
tr	Fin	The bear ran off .
tr	Fin	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Fin	Dr . Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
tr	Fin	Dr . Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement .
tr	Fin	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr . Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr . Fortier said .
tr	Fin	Dr . Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday .
tr	Fin	The other Canadian recipient of the medal was Ronald Joseph Crawford , 42 , of Hamilton , who was killed Aug . 4 , 2002 , while trying to defend a Hamilton sandwich shop owner from a robber wielding a knife .
tr	Fin	Mr . Crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .

tr	Fin	He was three months late in filing a name for the business , and he threatened to call his company Apple Computers if the other colleagues didn ' t suggest a better name by 5 O ' clock .
tr	Fin	It is not an acronym as popularly believed .
tr	Fin	It is short for San Francisco .
tr	Fin	It stands for COwpland REsearch Laboratory .

tr	Fin	Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tossed a coin to decidewhether the company they founded would be called Hewlett - Packard or Packard - Hewlett .
tr	Fin	Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore wanted to name their new company ' Moore Noyce ' but that was already trademarked by a hotel chain so they had to settle for an acronym of INTegrated ELectronics .
tr	Fin	Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from ' The Lotus Position ' or ' Padmasana '.
tr	Fin	Kapor used to be a teacher of Transcendental Meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .

tr	Fin	They kept the name Oracle and created the RDBMS engine .
tr	Fin	Later they kept the same name for the company .

tr	Fin	There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing Guild Wars , so why create a new one ?
tr	Fin	I say why not ?
tr	Fin	The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it ' s not going to go away .
tr	Fin	Usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used .
tr	Fin	I ' m nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions .
tr	Fin	Feb 2005 is the projected release date , although Guild Wars is made by ex - members of Blizzard , so Feb 2005 could mean August 2006 ...
tr	Fin	Anyway , I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I missed out on 2 / 3 weekend events .
tr	Fin	rumor has feb 05 on the calender .
tr	Fin	BUT they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long .

tr	Fin	My father re - secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U . S . dollars ($ 61 , 000 , 000 , 000 ).
tr	Fin	But my father ' s former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
tr	Fin	Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($ 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 ), both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
tr	Fin	Without the funds from our 1991 partners , we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq .
tr	Fin	That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance .
tr	Fin	Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice - president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
tr	Fin	I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
tr	Fin	I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried .
tr	Fin	A bold step taken shall not be regretted , I assure you .
tr	Fin	If you do not wish to co - operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter .
tr	Fin	I pray that you understand our plight .
tr	Fin	My family and our colleagues will be forever grateful .
tr	Fin	Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below .

tr	Fin	On September 21 , 2004 , the U . S . Senate Appropriations Committee approved $ 16 . 379 billion in funding for NASA for fiscal year 2005 .
tr	Fin	This is a $ 200 million increase over what NASA received for fiscal year 2004 .
tr	Fin	The bill reduces ISS operations by $ 120 million due to the continued reduced capability of the ISS for at least half of FY05 .

tr	Fin	Let me add some additional info .
tr	Fin	Also , from their own webpage , reasons why NASA is important , in a 5th grade format .
tr	Fin	I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
tr	Fin	Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently , crossed a modern bridge , flown in an airplane , recieved any form of modern medicine , did any mathematics , drove a car , used a cellular phone , etc . then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us .
tr	Fin	Also NASA has a large outreach program for education , some people believe this is important .

tr	Fin	An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China ' s soaring economic growth .
tr	Fin	The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .
tr	Fin	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .
tr	Fin	"For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China ' s relations with "" pariah states ""."
tr	Fin	In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur .
tr	Fin	Then , this month , it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran ' s nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
tr	Fin	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Fin	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Fin	This year it overtook Japan as the world ' s second largest consumer of energy , behind the US .
tr	Fin	Japan protested , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .
tr	Fin	The two are also set to clash over Russia ' s oil wealth .
tr	Fin	China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East .
tr	Fin	Japan favoured a route to the sea , enabling oil to be shipped to both Japan and China .
tr	Fin	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Fin	Claude Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly worth the trouble .
tr	Fin	""" Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world ,"" he said ."
tr	Fin	""" It may be a difficult political issue but I don ' t think the energy content is worthwhile ."""
tr	Fin	Eurasia Group , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price .
tr	Fin	""" If China ' s economy falters , which , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity prices will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets that produce them ,"" Jason Kindopp , Eurasia ' s lead China analyst , said ."
tr	Fin	""" Sudan is the primary example ,"" he said ."
tr	Fin	""" It marks the first time in recent years that China has promised to wield its veto power in the UN Security Council against a petition initiated by the United States and backed by France and Great Britain ."""
tr	Fin	If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .
tr	Fin	Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that .
tr	Fin	Meditation has to do with what is called ideation .
tr	Fin	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Fin	Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
tr	Fin	Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth .
tr	Fin	Your breathing should be calm and relaxed , through the nose .
tr	Fin	Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the air flowing through your nostrils .
tr	Fin	Continue to breathe slowly and deeply .
tr	Fin	Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .
tr	Fin	Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
tr	Fin	Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ), the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
tr	Fin	Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea .
tr	Fin	As you sit above the world , the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer .
tr	Fin	It surrounds you .
tr	Fin	The golden rays feel soft and soothing .
tr	Fin	Now you are far above the earth - into space .
tr	Fin	Everything around you is so vast .
tr	Fin	Yet , there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness .
tr	Fin	You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you .
tr	Fin	Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
tr	Fin	And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ).
tr	Fin	Try this for 5 to 10 minutes .
tr	Fin	Now come back to earth again - slowly .
tr	Fin	Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .
tr	Fin	Your muscles are loose and limp .
tr	Fin	Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
tr	Fin	The sun ' s rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .
tr	Fin	You are in a state of peace and relaxation .
tr	Fin	With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
tr	Fin	Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .
tr	Fin	You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
tr	Fin	This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .
tr	Fin	Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
tr	Fin	A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
tr	Fin	Let your mind and body be totally at peace .
tr	Fin	Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .
tr	Fin	Open your eyes .
tr	Fin	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Fin	Feel that you ' re sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
tr	Fin	Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction .
tr	Fin	Feel you ' re completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
tr	Fin	Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
tr	Fin	"Its meaning is "" Infinite happiness is everywhere ""."
tr	Fin	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Fin	Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you ' re repeating it .
tr	Fin	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Fin	Feel you ' re surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
tr	Fin	Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .
tr	Fin	OK that is fairly basic :).
tr	Fin	Don ' t worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that ' s normal .
tr	Fin	It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
tr	Fin	If you don ' t practice , then nothing happens .
tr	Fin	But that ’ s not the case .
tr	Fin	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Fin	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .
tr	Fin	Furthermore , the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration .
tr	Fin	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
tr	Fin	If you have any questions please feel free to call me ( after Sat . the 26th , when I will return from a trip ).
tr	Fin	Thank you for your consideration of this issue .
tr	Fin	The most fundamental human right , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings .
tr	Fin	We become most fully human when we love another person .
tr	Fin	"The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “ inalienable rights ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness ."""
tr	Fin	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Fin	We feel called to protest and oppose this injustice .
tr	Fin	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
tr	Fin	As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
tr	Fin	We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
tr	Fin	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
tr	Fin	However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
tr	Fin	We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter .
tr	Fin	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Fin	Likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Fin	As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
tr	Fin	Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :
tr	Fin	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Fin	He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
tr	Fin	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Fin	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
tr	Fin	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Fin	His co - workers love him .
tr	Fin	His fellow judges love him .
tr	Fin	His family loves him .
tr	Fin	President Bush loves him .
tr	Fin	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Fin	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Fin	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Fin	"There is an old saying that applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure ."""
tr	Fin	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Fin	In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
tr	Fin	"But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President ."
tr	Fin	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .
tr	Fin	Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .
tr	Fin	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Fin	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .
tr	Fin	AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .

tr	Fin	China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
tr	Fin	Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program ' s goals
tr	Fin	China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China ' s Gansu Province .
tr	Fin	A pair of military pilots embarked on China ' s second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days .
tr	Fin	The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
tr	Fin	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Fin	Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .
tr	Fin	But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
tr	Fin	"China ' s "" is not a fly - by - night program ,"" said Joan Johnson - Freese , an expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R . I ."
tr	Fin	""" They are not in any hurry ."
tr	Fin	"They want a program that will be a success ,"" Johnson - Freese said ."
tr	Fin	"Economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program ."""
tr	Fin	The freeze thawed some after Yang ' s 2003 mission .
tr	Fin	China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush ' s strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destinations .
tr	Fin	""" We applaud China ' s space achievements ,"" NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday ."
tr	Fin	""" We wish them a successful return of their astronauts ."""
tr	Fin	He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week ' s Chinese mission through formal channels .
tr	Fin	At present , there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel said .
tr	Fin	The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese said .
tr	Fin	At least one expert believes China ' s intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA ' s planned lunar return .
tr	Fin	""" The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly ,"" said John E . Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va .- based GlobalSecurity . org , a small national security think tank ."
tr	Fin	""" There is always the possibility they could jam us up , make us look like we are not numero uno ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Fin	During the U . S . and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays .
tr	Fin	As it turned out , the Soviets never made it to the moon .
tr	Fin	"""( China ) could be the second country to do that ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Fin	Pike ' s concern is based on China ' s development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea .
tr	Fin	I ' m a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
tr	Fin	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Fin	"The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their "" product "" as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love ."
tr	Fin	Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
tr	Fin	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Fin	I am serious about doing something .
tr	Fin	Here ' s the text of the email :
tr	Fin	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Fin	"Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats "" Meowing ,"" I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture ."
tr	Fin	I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
tr	Fin	I will .
tr	Fin	"This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure if any of you know much about civet cats , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles .
tr	Fin	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Fin	"The quote is from an article entitled "" Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem '"""
tr	Fin	If anyone wants the complete article , email me , as it is a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy .
tr	Fin	But this is what he says about civet cats :
tr	Fin	""" As an example , consider the treatment of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal ."
tr	Fin	What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment ?
tr	Fin	These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume .
tr	Fin	Musk , which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive , makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application .
tr	Fin	"( The heat increases their "" production "" of musk .)"
tr	Fin	This article , and specifically this piece , effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic .
tr	Fin	But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download , especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine ( 28k ).
tr	Fin	The url for the song is http :// www . sonic . net /~ fsjob / TragiCore - TheCivetCat . mp3
tr	Fin	Although there are no human vocals / lyrics , I think it ' s subject matter is audible .
tr	Fin	Again , if anyone wants to read Rachels ' entire article , let me know .
tr	Fin	It ' s also on the net .
tr	Fin	I was already a vegetarian when I read it a little more than a year ago , but it was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan .
tr	Fin	I hope all are well .

tr	Fin	Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists .
tr	Fin	Here are the four easy steps to success .
tr	Fin	Now get 6 U . S . $ 1 . 00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope ( to prevent thievery ).
tr	Fin	Next , place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them .
tr	Fin	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL !!!!!
tr	Fin	Like most of us I was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all .
tr	Fin	So I checked it out with the U . S . Post Office ( 1 - 800 - 238 - 5355 ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal !!
tr	Fin	Mail the six envelopes to the following addresses :
tr	Fin	STEP TWO : Now take the # 1 name off the list that you see above , move the other names up ( six becomes 5 , 5 becomes 4 , and etc .) and add YOUR NAME as number 6 on the list .
tr	Fin	Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to original as possible .
tr	Fin	Now post your amended article to at least 200 news groups . :
tr	Fin	( I think there are close to 24 , 000 groups )
tr	Fin	All you need is 200 , but remember , the more you post , the more money you make !!

tr	Fin	Blue Planet : Who ' s afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?
tr	Fin	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Fin	After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .
tr	Fin	Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .
tr	Fin	In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .
tr	Fin	Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
tr	Fin	If true , the caper failed .
tr	Fin	Over time , the wolf ' s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
tr	Fin	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Fin	This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .
tr	Fin	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Fin	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
tr	Fin	""" All you have to do is look at the photographs ,"" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI ' s Blue Planet ,"
tr	Fin	""" You say , ' wow !'"
tr	Fin	"An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow ."""
tr	Fin	Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park ' s northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .
tr	Fin	""" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people ,"" Beschta told Blue Planet ."
tr	Fin	""" There ' s a lot of impact on plants and they say , ' Who cares ?'"
tr	Fin	Since wolf recovery , streamside plants , willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing shrubs that bears can use .
tr	Fin	It ' s important with regard to the quality of streams .
tr	Fin	The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability .
tr	Fin	"Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems ."""
tr	Fin	Yellowstone has a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .
tr	Fin	Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
tr	Fin	""" I ' m pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations ,"" however , he cautioned ."
tr	Fin	""" Wolves are still pretty new ."
tr	Fin	They ' ve only been there for 10 years .
tr	Fin	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal ' s status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
tr	Fin	Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .
tr	Fin	Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .
tr	Fin	On Jan . 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E . Jones appeared to agree with them .
tr	Fin	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf ' s status .
tr	Fin	Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
tr	Fin	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Fin	"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic ."""
tr	Fin	There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31 , 000 mountain lions .
tr	Fin	Pound for pound , mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves .
tr	Fin	They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
tr	Fin	Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .
tr	Fin	It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
tr	Fin	They seem to be just that : rumors .
tr	Fin	True , there are about 300 , 000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .
tr	Fin	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Fin	Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .
tr	Fin	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .

tr	Fin	Climate : Humans fuss , animals adjust
tr	Fin	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non - human natural world to changing conditions , and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming .
tr	Fin	Nina Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61 - year uninterrupted phenological records .
tr	Fin	Phenology studies an organism ' s development and life cycle -- the pulse of life .
tr	Fin	Bradley ' s record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999 , spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data .
tr	Fin	Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier .
tr	Fin	Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming .
tr	Fin	In England , the cuckoo returns earlier .
tr	Fin	An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one - third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago .
tr	Fin	""" One of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities ,"" concluded a report titled "" Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States ,"" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week ."
tr	Fin	Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology .
tr	Fin	""" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change ,"" said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world ' s leading experts on this issue ."
tr	Fin	These changes are occurring across all species , Parmesan told UPI ' s Climate .
tr	Fin	""" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding ,"" she said ."
tr	Fin	""" Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver ,"" she said ."
tr	Fin	"Throughout the United States , she said , "" spring is about two weeks earlier ."
tr	Fin	"As the Pew report concluded , "" Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U . S . ecosystems ."""
tr	Fin	Such consequences include shifting and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems .
tr	Fin	The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .
tr	Fin	"The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "" Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ."""
tr	Fin	""" The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic ,"" said ACIA chair Robert Corell ."
tr	Fin	The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years .
tr	Fin	Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the assessment found , with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice .
tr	Fin	""" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction ,"" the report concluded ."
tr	Fin	As with so much climate research , not everyone agrees with these dire predictions .
tr	Fin	"A third report , "" The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future ,"" completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category ."
tr	Fin	"On the one hand , the IPN report agreed "" Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise ."
tr	Fin	"This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase ."""
tr	Fin	On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .
tr	Fin	""" The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge ,"" the IPN report said ."
tr	Fin	The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster .
tr	Fin	Important species that probably would decline include shrimp , capelin , Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish .
tr	Fin	The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non - commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .
tr	Fin	The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears , checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables .
tr	Fin	The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument .
tr	Fin	They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non - commercial species , and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy .
tr	Fin	""" When dandelions have set the mark of May on Wisconsin pastures , it is time to listen for the final proof of spring ,"" wrote Aldo Leopold in "" A Sand County Almanac ."""

tr	Fin	When not in Texas , I lived in LA and San Francisco .
tr	Fin	There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and I ' ve vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi , and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white ( less than 20 %) in northeastern Arkansas .
tr	Fin	The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
tr	Fin	So , yes , America has pockets that are more diverse than others .
tr	Fin	Some refused to leave , but so many were unable to .
tr	Fin	Yes , it ' s a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .
tr	Fin	However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
tr	Fin	I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
tr	Fin	I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
tr	Fin	I ' m interested in what America will look like in 5 years .
tr	Fin	Or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives ?
tr	Fin	These are some of the things I ' ve been wondering ...
tr	Fin	Your reply is good and deserves something good in return .
tr	Fin	Okay , I ' m new to this forum and really don ' t like Bush , so my view point is slanted and I admit that .
tr	Fin	I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what ' s the point ?
tr	Fin	What I know is that I have a close friend who ' s aunt disappeared in New Orleans .
tr	Fin	The family here ( California ) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA , so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there .
tr	Fin	It is Oct . 6 , and not one family member has been located .
tr	Fin	What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation .
tr	Fin	Recently , Bush addressed the nation .
tr	Fin	About 30 seconds into his address , he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time .
tr	Fin	Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk .
tr	Fin	I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once , you can ' t help but trot it out every time your act is going sour .
tr	Fin	"We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "" FREEDOM "" why not spend those billions making all of us free ?"
tr	Fin	I ' m sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off .
tr	Fin	In the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave .

tr	Fin	"In 1594 PEREZ wrote & published a book under the assumed name of "" RAPHAEL PEREGRINO ."""

tr	Fin	John Lennon entered stardom being a murderer .
tr	Fin	"The same demons that made captain Smith say "" Not even God can sink my ship "" spoke from antichrist John Lennon ( from Liverpool , base port to the Titanic ) saying : "" Christianity is on the go ."
tr	Fin	"We are more popular than Jesus and Pope ""...."
tr	Fin	That was the day that GOD ' S CURSE fell upon the world of Rock .
tr	Fin	One week after that declaration , ONLY ONE WEEK LATER , Brian Epstein , forger of the Beatle farce , died from an overdose .
tr	Fin	From then on , the Beatles began to get involved in false religions and to preach them to the world .
tr	Fin	"John Lennon ' s divorce followed , as well as his entering the world of black magic , as deeply as to buy the apartment . where the "" Rosemary ' s baby "" had been filmed , previous property of Roman Polansky , and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations ."
tr	Fin	"Came the disintegration of the Beatles ' minds with LSD which has caused , among others , schizophrenic lyrics such as "" I am the Walrus "" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "" Revolution number 9 ""."
tr	Fin	"At the same time , the devil acted through his other main puppets with "" Sympathy for the devil "" that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ), murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin ."
tr	Fin	"Antichrist John Lennon followed the Devil ' s strategy writing lyrics such as "" God is a concept by which we measure our pain ... I don ' t believe in Jesus , etc ., etc .,"" ( God ) and "" and no religions too ..."" ( Imagine )."
tr	Fin	"Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "" Peace "", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of "" The ballad of John and Yoko "": "" the way things are going , they ' re going to crucify me ..."", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine ( today condensed in the "" Lennon remembers "" book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming "" whatever is up there "" for it ( referring to God )."
tr	Fin	The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead .
tr	Fin	It is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times , being seven , as well as three , the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition ....
tr	Fin	"To Paul McCartney whose company ' s logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "" Sir "" ( when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir , as long as he produces money for the nation ), GOD provided cancer to the wife ."
tr	Fin	At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda ' s death for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity .
tr	Fin	Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he didn ' t say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much .
tr	Fin	"The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality , he grew the beard that we see in the "" Let it Be "" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film , doing every effort he could to be seen as a man ...."
tr	Fin	"It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : "" I ' ve got a feeling , a feeling I can ' t hide ..."" in front of Yoko in the film ."
tr	Fin	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Fin	Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg , so that he could stand out , being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again , as Jane and Linda did .
tr	Fin	This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
tr	Fin	He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness .
tr	Fin	Besides being a murderer , John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern , trauma from which he never recovered .
tr	Fin	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."
tr	Fin	One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono .
tr	Fin	That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be .
tr	Fin	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Fin	"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" they advise black Joe to "" get back to where you once belonged "", as if England was not a place for black people ."
tr	Fin	Sometimes back , Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles .
tr	Fin	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .
tr	Fin	The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George ' s house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from .
tr	Fin	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Fin	It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him .
tr	Fin	Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other .
tr	Fin	Paul McCartney said that George Harrison is a nothing .
tr	Fin	George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon ....
tr	Fin	"George Harrison said in a video that "" Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn ' t be playing at all "", all of it being the truth , but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians , if musicians at all , who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis ."
tr	Fin	"The Beatles of the times of the "" Cavern "" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin ."
tr	Fin	Without George Martin the Beatles would have been just another untalented band as Oasis ....
tr	Fin	Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic , and he does lots of charity , thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife ' s life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic .
tr	Fin	He thinks he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived .
tr	Fin	"After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "" Devil ' s Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc ., etc .,"
tr	Fin	The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve , was because the forces of Satan were behind everything , supporting the process .
tr	Fin	If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house , it is because you own some L . P , CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones .
tr	Fin	We recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the Devil ' s main nine puppets ....
tr	Fin	""" The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year , according to German media reports , reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media ,"" reported UPI on December 30th ."
tr	Fin	""" The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week ,"" continued UPI , "" quoted ' NATO intelligence sources ' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah - led regime into line , including military options ."
tr	Fin	"This ' all options are open ' line has been President George W Bush ' s publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months ."""
tr	Fin	An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order .
tr	Fin	Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi ' ite leadership in Iran that go back decades .
tr	Fin	In essence , Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government .
tr	Fin	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Fin	The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases , and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power .
tr	Fin	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Fin	"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran "" has some 540 , 000 men under arms and over 350 , 000 reserves ."
tr	Fin	They include 120 , 000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Fin	"Iran ' s military also includes holdings of 1 , 613 main battle tanks , 21 , 600 other armored fighting vehicles , 3 , 200 artillery weapons , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopters , 3 submarines , 59 surface combatants , and 10 amphibious ships ."""
tr	Fin	""" Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability ,"" continued the CSIS report ."
tr	Fin	""" Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional threat of proliferation ."
tr	Fin	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Fin	"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."
tr	Fin	The so called ' Tanker ' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region .
tr	Fin	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Fin	""" More concerning ,"" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy ."
tr	Fin	"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect , anti - shipping cruise missiles : ' Iran has obtained new anti - ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines .'"""
tr	Fin	It is Iran ' s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .
tr	Fin	The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .
tr	Fin	In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf .
tr	Fin	Of all the missiles in Iran ' s armament , the most dangerous is the Russian - made SS - N - 22 Sunburn .
tr	Fin	These missiles are , simply , the fastest anti - ship weapons on the planet .
tr	Fin	Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2 . 2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .
tr	Fin	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .
tr	Fin	The missile ' s manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer , and five missiles could sink a 20 , 000 ton ship .
tr	Fin	The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile .
tr	Fin	Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 sailors .
tr	Fin	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
tr	Fin	"In February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" challenges and threats "" in the region ."
tr	Fin	This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America ' s condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus .
tr	Fin	Like Iran , Syria ' s military is nothing to scoff at .
tr	Fin	Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
tr	Fin	Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel ' s overwhelming capabilities .
tr	Fin	As of 2002 , Syria had some 215 , 000 soldiers under arms , 4 , 700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability .
tr	Fin	Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region , comprised primarily of SCUD - derived systems .
tr	Fin	Iran , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies .
tr	Fin	While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .
tr	Fin	This threat exists not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .
tr	Fin	More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .
tr	Fin	"Paul Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $ 1 trillion ."
tr	Fin	China ' s accumulation of dollars is approximately $ 600 billion .
tr	Fin	South Korea holds about $ 200 billion .
tr	Fin	These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States .
tr	Fin	China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .
tr	Fin	In short , China has the American economy by the throat .
tr	Fin	China ' s strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States .
tr	Fin	The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception .
tr	Fin	Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , recruiting is at an all - time low .
tr	Fin	Add to this the economic threat posed by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe .
tr	Fin	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .
tr	Fin	Conclusion : Is Any of This Possible ?
tr	Fin	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Fin	Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .
tr	Fin	Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe .
tr	Fin	"The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Fin	Unfortunately , all the dangers in the world are no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encased zealot .
tr	Fin	Look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
tr	Fin	Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media .
tr	Fin	More significantly , recall Iraq .
tr	Fin	"Karl Rove , Bush ' s most senior advisor , notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war ."""
tr	Fin	The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election .
tr	Fin	The answer lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
tr	Fin	The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP gains in Congress , and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away .
tr	Fin	Is any of this a probability ?
tr	Fin	Logic says no , but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics .
tr	Fin	All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .
tr	Fin	They did it once already in Iraq .
tr	Fin	408 - Number of species that could be extinct by 2050 if the global - warming trend continues .

tr	Fin	Those roms focus on speed and stability .
tr	Fin	They are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit .
tr	Fin	As a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom .
tr	Fin	Hope you read through this .
tr	Fin	are the moors and penines in Yorkshire a lonely eerie place ?
tr	Fin	and how big are they ?
tr	Fin	im 33 .
tr	Fin	ive never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all ... i can see the penines in the far distance from my bedroom window .
tr	Fin	when i watched werewolf in london ( great film ) that was the only time i saw the yorkshire moors .
tr	Fin	They can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands , then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
tr	Fin	The people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland .
tr	Fin	They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out , and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers .
tr	Fin	I have a western pleasure appy thats really heavy on her left lead at the lope ?
tr	Fin	My appy is very heavy on her left lead at the lope .
tr	Fin	She seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat ...
tr	Fin	Put on a pair of spurs and before she makes that trot step , it ' s in the feeling when you feel her think trot , tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving .
tr	Fin	Lope her to the left in circles , keep her head to the inside of the circle and push her but out , keep doing this if she breaks to a jog go a little bit bigger circle , till she can get enough balance to go small and small . circles
tr	Fin	hi everyone .... just hav my hands on my new OLYMPUS X940 digital camera .. wel , i always wanted 2 hav one by sony .. but anyways , ended up having olympus X940 from my dad ....... does any1 already has it ?
tr	Fin	how has ur experience with it ?
tr	Fin	is it a gud option for casual / formal functions photography ?????
tr	Fin	is it comparable to sony products or not ??
tr	Fin	it has 14 mega pixel camera ... n 4xwide optical zoom ...
tr	Fin	Olympus X - 940 14 Megapixel Digital Camera has filters and can do all sorts of special effects .
tr	Fin	It is def worth more than the price .
tr	Fin	I am VERY satisfied .
tr	Fin	Get your English in order before writing here again please .
tr	Fin	just want to ask .. i have an nikon dslr .. im wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200 - 300percent .. i can see some dead pixel ... is there something wrong with my camera body ?
tr	Fin	please help me .. and what should i do to fix this problem ?
tr	Fin	or it is normal ?
tr	Fin	Are you sure it isn ' t dirt on the sensor ?
tr	Fin	Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
tr	Fin	Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
tr	Fin	Watch out the poles are coming ..... my little butterfly
tr	Fin	That would be preferable but it doesn ' t matter , could be something similar
tr	Fin	It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Fin	It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Fin	In Chicago , what is the best restaurant to dine at on a budget ?
tr	Fin	Take the red line to Clark , then you turn right .
tr	Fin	Walk 2 blocks then turn right again .
tr	Fin	Walk 2 more blocks then cross the street .
tr	Fin	Not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go .
tr	Fin	A lunch will be less expensive than a dinner .
tr	Fin	Check out http :// www . restaurant . com lots of restaurants you can look at the menu and check out prices .
tr	Fin	Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area .
tr	Fin	Is there any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Fin	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Fin	I know that the mouse will probably die , but I was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Fin	I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
tr	Fin	A common one is arsenic and there really isn ' t a way to cure that .
tr	Fin	Take the mouse to an emergency vet and have them use CO2 to put the mouse to sleep .
tr	Fin	A quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it ' s head .
tr	Fin	So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend .
tr	Fin	She loves giraffes and homemade things !
tr	Fin	I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture .
tr	Fin	The key is ... I have a few problems :
tr	Fin	1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
tr	Fin	And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile !
tr	Fin	Is there any way to strengthen it ?
tr	Fin	3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?
tr	Fin	air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent , so you can leave the wire armature inside , paint with acrylic paint
tr	Fin	i have a 3 - 4 month old kitten and i live in forida .
tr	Fin	My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside .
tr	Fin	she is also good in a carrier .
tr	Fin	We took our cat Mitten camping .
tr	Fin	He loved it .
tr	Fin	But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ).
tr	Fin	Would pledge be ok ?
tr	Fin	If not , what is ?
tr	Fin	Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don ' t require cleaner .
tr	Fin	Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate .
tr	Fin	I agree w the answer from Nothing .
tr	Fin	Swiffer or any type of micro - fiber cloth is excellent .
tr	Fin	"I use Miracle Cloth , they ' re fantastic , just don ' t use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them , it ruins their "" grabbing "" ability ."
tr	Fin	RP : Is it wrong to want to remove a contact because they are really really stupid ...?
tr	Fin	its definitely not you .
tr	Fin	Its not any of you lol
tr	Fin	i emailed you saaaaaam .
tr	Fin	it ' s not me is it !?
tr	Fin	iguzwhat lol
tr	Fin	EDIT : I love how she says it ' s not callum but doesn ' t deny it ' s me .... i think we all know who she ' s talking about ...
tr	Fin	EDIT : now i ' m curious ...
tr	Fin	lol they really aren ' t that much worse than me
tr	Fin	and their gpa was better than mine ....
tr	Fin	i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
tr	Fin	Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
tr	Fin	But word of advice if you ' re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
tr	Fin	yes of course you can ....
tr	Fin	I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here
tr	Fin	If in dongle you mean USB stick then yes USB sticks are the same any were you go :) hope that answered your question .
tr	Fin	I am nervous that my other fish will eat them , and I don ' t know what to feed them !
tr	Fin	Feed the babies 3 - 4 times a day with flakes .
tr	Fin	Provide plenty of hiding places like rocks , plants , etc in the tank .
tr	Fin	Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded .
tr	Fin	"Look in the pet stores for "" fry food "" or "" baby fish foods ""."
tr	Fin	what kind of newborn fish you have ?
tr	Fin	I have a question about McDonald ' s Monopoly !
tr	Fin	Please HELP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Fin	If you can ?
tr	Fin	Ok , I know that Mcdonald ' s has Monopoly going on right now .
tr	Fin	& I wanna know what food has the game pieces .
tr	Fin	And what food has EXTRA game pieces .
tr	Fin	Because Large Fries give you FOUR PIECES !
tr	Fin	When most of the food or drinks I got only included two !
tr	Fin	PLEASE HELP !!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Fin	THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!! : D
tr	Fin	scroll down and this website shows each thing you can buy (:
tr	Fin	becca is right .
tr	Fin	they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i wouldnt .
tr	Fin	they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :)
tr	Fin	Theyre not really hard .
tr	Fin	Beardies are actually quite delicate .
tr	Fin	They just are there as an adaptation .
tr	Fin	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Fin	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Fin	For horses that are strong pullers .
tr	Fin	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Fin	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Fin	I know that ' s vague , but it depends on the horse .
tr	Fin	The rider needs to have independent hands as well , because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)
tr	Fin	I want to save up for a canon t3i , around 750 - 800 + :(
tr	Fin	I ' m currently 12 and I get about 20 dollars a week for lunch , sometimes a bit more , I plan to save 10 dollars every week :)
tr	Fin	My birthday is in november and I get about .... 150 or more since i hate my dads family .. haha
tr	Fin	Be happy you get a bit , many of us never got nothing :)
tr	Fin	There ' s a Canon EOS T2i , with the exact same sensor , just no articulating screen .
tr	Fin	It ' s around $ 100 less , which means you get the same camera but quicker !
tr	Fin	Here ' s a DSLR Buying Guide - http :// www . the - dslr - photographer . com / 2009 / 11 / which - dslr - to - buy /
tr	Fin	Don ' t worry about it .
tr	Fin	hey kido u made me smile
tr	Fin	its for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
tr	Fin	"took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ("" the way you would icing "") to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "" mud """
tr	Fin	Plaster of Paris does two things
tr	Fin	- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
tr	Fin	- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
tr	Fin	I ' m quite sure , you don ' t even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it ' s edges , the part that is making the noise .
tr	Fin	works well lasts long .
tr	Fin	I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn ' t use it -
tr	Fin	he makes so much MORE noise , as he plays and digs and jumps ( seriously )
tr	Fin	wheels are relatively noiseless -
tr	Fin	a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet !
tr	Fin	My origin Station is Howrah , but I want to board at Asansol ..
tr	Fin	In Calcutta there is a Foreigner ' s reservation office where they speak English very well .
tr	Fin	This is where you can get AND change express train tickets .
tr	Fin	so better inquire in railway office
tr	Fin	Contact the Indian railways .
tr	Fin	my name is Josalyn Leainne Creek and i ' m 19 years old and i graduated from high in May adn of this year and i love animals and i ' m great at working and i had drama in my last job which was mcallister ' s deli and i ', a mormon and i hvae changed to be a better person that pwople are wanting to hirier and i ' m willing to work whenever you need me but i go to church on every sunday and i have a doctor ' s appointment this thursday at 2 ; 30 and i hope you h = guys hirier me because i work very hard and i dont care about how much you guys pay and i ' ve been looking for a job ever since i have graduated and i hate drama
tr	Fin	Jeez , work on your spelling and punctuation .
tr	Fin	It makes a huge difference .
tr	Fin	Cover letters and resumes need to be perfect .
tr	Fin	I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada , I received one that is valid until October of 2015 .
tr	Fin	Problem is , for some reason , the visa process took longer than it should , thus I missed school this semester ( visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn ' t attend ), now I no longer want to go into that school ( because they only would accept me again on September of 2012 ), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012 , can I use the same visa that was issued to me ?
tr	Fin	This is the cage I have whhich is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to escape from :
tr	Fin	I love this cage , it ' s easy to clean , very spacious and fun for the hamster
tr	Fin	Aquiriums are good also , but provide a mesh top for an easy airway .
tr	Fin	Wire cages are NOT acceptable for dwarfs really , unless the bars have less than half a cm between them .
tr	Fin	regards and have fun with your hammy
tr	Fin	I am 17 years old .
tr	Fin	I dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment .
tr	Fin	I am very unhappy here .
tr	Fin	Would it be best for me to finish college ?
tr	Fin	I live in London .
tr	Fin	I want to go travelling .
tr	Fin	But right now its the most convenient thing to do .
tr	Fin	What is the best way of doing it ?
tr	Fin	Hotels for travelling will be expensive .
tr	Fin	anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience .
tr	Fin	I want to go all over :) I don ' t have a set route yet .
tr	Fin	Get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket .
tr	Fin	Wool is best .
tr	Fin	Hit the road .
tr	Fin	I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
tr	Fin	The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
tr	Fin	And her last name , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?
tr	Fin	Certainly , Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam , only in Vietnam .
tr	Fin	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Fin	"Full name of the father is : "" Nguyen Thanh Luan "" ===> Full name of the son / daughter certainly is "" Nguyen .........."", for instance , "" Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan ""."
tr	Fin	I ' m pretty sure that Mayko is Japanese .
tr	Fin	She is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure where her first name is from ...
tr	Fin	I have a splitter / filter between my ADSL and ph line ?
tr	Fin	I have 2 phones running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter , I ' m still getting a buzzing noise even when I have disconnected the other phone without one .
tr	Fin	Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well ?
tr	Fin	turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there ... could be static on the line ... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is NOT the DSL ....
tr	Fin	if the trouble goes away with the modem off , then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered , this would include the alarm system , fax machine , satellite boxes , phones , etc ...
tr	Fin	if everything is filtered , and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there , try doubling up on the filters ...
tr	Fin	You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks , except the one which the DSL modem connects .
tr	Fin	Whats the easiest thing ?
tr	Fin	Well a changing bag would be the easiest solution .
tr	Fin	It ' s light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera .
tr	Fin	It ' s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you ' re outside .
tr	Fin	A changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag .
tr	Fin	A film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field .
tr	Fin	Many online stores carry them , like Adorama :
tr	Fin	I have a few how to videos for DIY 35mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel :
tr	Fin	For more info on lo - fi photography , check put my website :
tr	Fin	I ' ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David .
tr	Fin	My argument is it ' s art and therefore should not be censored he ' s making us censor it who ' s right
tr	Fin	no , it ' s only a body of a young man
tr	Fin	No , it was guys .
tr	Fin	Your teacher knows what goes on in your community and wants to keep her job .
tr	Fin	Let her do it - argue when you are of age and can battle the other adults in your community - skipping of course telling your boss he / she is a prudish ignoramus because you want to keep your job .
tr	Fin	I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome .
tr	Fin	Sidenote ... I am familiar with the Capital Grille , Barclay Prime , The Palm , The Prime Rib , Mortons , Ruth Chris ', etc .
tr	Fin	Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier .
tr	Fin	I am only familiar with Morton ' s and Ruth Chris .
tr	Fin	I hope you get your answer .
tr	Fin	Anyway , have a lovely first anniversary !
tr	Fin	HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?
tr	Fin	or would the steam from the shower be a problem ?
tr	Fin	There are some things to consider though ...
tr	Fin	Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .
tr	Fin	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
tr	Fin	It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
tr	Fin	What is the most interesting place to see in South Korea ?
tr	Fin	What place or town would be most interesting to visit for european ?
tr	Fin	Go to Jeju island !
tr	Fin	It ' s so much fun over there , and I ' m positive that you ' ll love it ! :)
tr	Fin	It ' s a really huge place over there , and so many visitors / foreigners went to put chains and locks over there !
tr	Fin	It ' s so much fun !
tr	Fin	Also , don ' t forget to try out Korea ' s famous amusement parks !: Lotte World , Everland , and Carribbean Bay !
tr	Fin	Everyone loves it ! ^ _ ^
tr	Fin	( It ' s indoors and outdoors !)
tr	Fin	( it ' s all outdoors and the pictures are only a fourth of the real Everland !)
tr	Fin	Hoped I helped ! ^ _ ^
tr	Fin	Have fun in Korea ~
tr	Fin	its really amazing there , itll blow your mind
tr	Fin	it ' s almost like paradise there
tr	Fin	I found an injured pure white bird ( dove I guess ?)
tr	Fin	I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood , its wing is injured , so I ' m currently taking care of it .
tr	Fin	It ' s pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I don ' t know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
tr	Fin	Is normal bird food fine ?
tr	Fin	( Because apparently my mom is very picky , she says the bird might get sick if it doesn ' t eat the right food ) IS there any specific food I might find at any pet shop ?
tr	Fin	Doves are a species of pigeon , they are Seed eaters , they do not eat bread , or worms .
tr	Fin	make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
tr	Fin	there ' s these little like bait worms at jacks . petshoppe .
tr	Fin	its jacks aquarium and pets I believe . ?
tr	Fin	anyways I feed them to my road sometimes .
tr	Fin	or buy small bait worms .
tr	Fin	If you have a pet store near buy some wheat , pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do , but do not feed bread .
tr	Fin	i have two options
tr	Fin	"In the airport , follow the signs that say "" Paris by train ""."
tr	Fin	Buy a ticket for Paris .
tr	Fin	"Stay on it until the "" Saint - Michel Notre - Dame "" station ."
tr	Fin	"Change there to the Metro 4 line going toward "" Porte d ' Orleans ""."
tr	Fin	"Get off at the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" station ."
tr	Fin	As I recall , this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris .
tr	Fin	"On the bus : Get on Bus 95 going toward "" Porte de Vanves ""."
tr	Fin	Buy a ticket from the driver .
tr	Fin	"Stay on the bus until the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" stop ."
tr	Fin	On the Metro : Get in the Metro at Opera .
tr	Fin	"Take the 8 line toward "" Balard "" until the "" Invalides "" station ."
tr	Fin	"Change there to the 13 line toward "" Chatillon Montrouge "" and take it until the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" station ."
tr	Fin	What are good B & W software ' s Photography ?
tr	Fin	What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing ?
tr	Fin	I use GIMP and Its not cutting it , looks terrible .
tr	Fin	Here ' s one of my shots in B & W
tr	Fin	Any programs that you use please list :) Thx
tr	Fin	Open your image while it ' s still in color
tr	Fin	Create a new layer and fill the later with black .
tr	Fin	"Set the layer mode to "" color "" this will make your image blak and white ."
tr	Fin	Click colors >>> levels and adjust each channel ' s color values .
tr	Fin	For more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial : http :// gimpedblog . blogspot . com / 2011 / 09 / gimp - video - tutorial - how - to - convert . html
tr	Fin	For more information on adjusting exposure in gimp chef out this gimp video tutorial : http :// gimpedblog . blogspot . com / 2011 / 09 / how - to - use - gimp - for - beginners - lesson - 4 . html
tr	Fin	Picasa is free and pretty good .
tr	Fin	But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if your on a macbook theres aperture :)
tr	Fin	"depends what you want from "" B & W ""... many programs will use a generic B & W ..."
tr	Fin	try something like photoscape which has different options ...
tr	Fin	I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body .
tr	Fin	Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for . .
tr	Fin	I know I wouldn ' t .
tr	Fin	You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
tr	Fin	"Sometimes the "" cheap "" comes expensive !"
tr	Fin	If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now !
tr	Fin	Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time .
tr	Fin	The cheapest * high quality * plastic surgeons are at Yanhee Hospitals .
tr	Fin	They do outstanding work .
tr	Fin	Check the link for a sampling of prices .
tr	Fin	When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
tr	Fin	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Fin	It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive .
tr	Fin	There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods .
tr	Fin	Read the labels for contents .
tr	Fin	He might be sick take him to the vet to see
tr	Fin	If he always does this , welcome to the club .
tr	Fin	My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver ( cooked ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest .
tr	Fin	Whats your favorite part about trail riding ?
tr	Fin	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Fin	They would be too scared and spooky .
tr	Fin	What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
tr	Fin	That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
tr	Fin	Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good .
tr	Fin	YOU have to spend the time training .
tr	Fin	Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
tr	Fin	I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand .
tr	Fin	I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size .
tr	Fin	I have a 10 gallon filter on it .
tr	Fin	I also have a powerhead , getting another soon .
tr	Fin	I have a few questions , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
tr	Fin	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Fin	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Fin	From what I understand they ' re pretty much the same thing .
tr	Fin	Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
tr	Fin	I just want an e - reader that does a little bit more than just read .
tr	Fin	Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that ' s not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
tr	Fin	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Fin	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Fin	When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
tr	Fin	So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
tr	Fin	I ' m pretty sure it ' ll be worth it .
tr	Fin	Have fun !
tr	Fin	Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
tr	Fin	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Fin	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Fin	We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I ' m not an expert on the area .
tr	Fin	A little help is always great . =)
tr	Fin	Thank you or your feed back .
tr	Fin	Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
tr	Fin	"Go to a local market or drug store , and buy this month ' s copy of the "" Philadelphia Magazine ""."
tr	Fin	It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
tr	Fin	It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
tr	Fin	If you ' re looking for a good burger , some great fries ( they are too die for !), and good drinks , go to Chickie & Pete ' s !
tr	Fin	Oh my gosh , they are great !
tr	Fin	If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you won ' t regret it :)
tr	Fin	I ' m still a beginner .
tr	Fin	When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that is floating on top .
tr	Fin	Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur bettas delicate fins .
tr	Fin	You add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
tr	Fin	Start up your filter ( sponge filters are the best for bettas ) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
tr	Fin	Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your water .
tr	Fin	Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
tr	Fin	ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up , they would know
tr	Fin	Add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
tr	Fin	Make sure the temperature is good .
tr	Fin	Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank .
tr	Fin	Everything else should be good .
tr	Fin	Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another .
tr	Fin	Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang ?
tr	Fin	I see youre still recovering from the accident .
tr	Fin	You appear to be feeling better though .
tr	Fin	That ' s good . :)
tr	Fin	Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang .
tr	Fin	Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip .
tr	Fin	Laser grips are the most common for wangs .
tr	Fin	Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip .
tr	Fin	You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions .
tr	Fin	Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi - automatic wangs .
tr	Fin	Newer semi - automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft .
tr	Fin	Prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang .
tr	Fin	You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang .
tr	Fin	Tighten these screws securely .
tr	Fin	Flip the switch and adjust your laser sight according to the directions in the owner manual that comes with the laser sight .
tr	Fin	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Fin	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Fin	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Fin	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Fin	She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
tr	Fin	What is the problem ?
tr	Fin	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Fin	I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he / she sleeps .
tr	Fin	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Fin	When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can ' t produce milk .
tr	Fin	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Fin	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Fin	Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby .
tr	Fin	Ignore the answer above me , btw ! ^ _ ^
tr	Fin	Ok maybe that isn ' t the right question , but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada , can you send texts to another united states number ?
tr	Fin	Im sorry if I couldn ' t say the question right .
tr	Fin	I hope somebody understands what I mean
tr	Fin	The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it wouldn ' t work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
tr	Fin	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Fin	It varie $ company to company .
tr	Fin	Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text .
tr	Fin	Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection .
tr	Fin	$ ometime $ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $ involved what $ ome of your money .
tr	Fin	"Hope you unde $ tood the me $$ age I do have an "" S "" key on my computer ."

tr	Fin	Is Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
tr	Fin	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Fin	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Fin	I ' d be happy if someone helps , especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)
tr	Fin	I LIVE THERE !
tr	Fin	I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
tr	Fin	Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains !
tr	Fin	... Fishing , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things you can do for fun .
tr	Fin	So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but its quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
tr	Fin	please let me know if you need anything else
tr	Fin	Visited Fujairah when in Dubai .
tr	Fin	Are there any new Gaming console ?
tr	Fin	I ' m a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
tr	Fin	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Fin	XBOX Joys are soo comfyy .....
tr	Fin	Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
tr	Fin	Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don ' t plan on making another one for a while .
tr	Fin	What is the typical lifespan of a cat ?
tr	Fin	My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill .
tr	Fin	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Fin	I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
tr	Fin	My cat is 18 years old .
tr	Fin	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Fin	Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11 - 15 years .
tr	Fin	Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues , so your cat has done very well .
tr	Fin	Male cats very seldom live past 14 - 15 years .
tr	Fin	By comparison , outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment .
tr	Fin	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Fin	Anything after 12 is a bonus .
tr	Fin	I thought that I had gained my cockatiel ' s trust , but now he ' s not coming to me when I open his cage .
tr	Fin	Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it ' s lost so easily !
tr	Fin	Birds eat and sleep with their flock , not predators .
tr	Fin	Keep his cage open and go on your computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
tr	Fin	Let him go at his own pace , don ' t rush with him , and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird .
tr	Fin	Patience is the key . =)
tr	Fin	he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
tr	Fin	dat bird is smart .
tr	Fin	like my dogs , they really like me and trust me , but when I open the door to get them outside , they run from me , they know I ' m going to take them outside and they don ' t like it .
tr	Fin	Hi im a big fan of breyer horses !
tr	Fin	My breyers need stables or barns though ..... and I need directions and materials on how to make them .
tr	Fin	And I need to know where to buy the materials .
tr	Fin	Please make this as simple as you can for my dad doesnt really not that good .
tr	Fin	sketch out floor plan , estimate size , draw front view , side view , and 3d orthographic perspective views ,
tr	Fin	figure out how many stalls you want , then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse ,
tr	Fin	there are many small details , that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof ,
tr	Fin	check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts , you want carpenter wood glue , clamps , possibly small screws to hold corners together , miniature hinges , tape , paint , saws , drills , pencil ruler , paper , bryer horses
tr	Fin	I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today .
tr	Fin	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Fin	And when I move it I guess he figures I ' m playing . x . x
tr	Fin	I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
tr	Fin	That seems cruel to me though .
tr	Fin	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Fin	When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
tr	Fin	maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
tr	Fin	yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way , hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
tr	Fin	lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , hes also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
tr	Fin	Which rat cage is better ?
tr	Fin	Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
tr	Fin	This one is better for rats .
tr	Fin	You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
tr	Fin	They LOVE to climb .
tr	Fin	Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
tr	Fin	If you use this cage it ' s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
tr	Fin	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Fin	Here are some better options IMO :
tr	Fin	These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
tr	Fin	The First One Is much Better !
tr	Fin	I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
tr	Fin	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Fin	is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
tr	Fin	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Fin	from my understanding , if its heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
tr	Fin	what are your suggestions and opinons ?
tr	Fin	i use UTH ' s on all of my burrowing snakes .
tr	Fin	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
tr	Fin	i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
tr	Fin	on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
tr	Fin	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
tr	Fin	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
tr	Fin	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
tr	Fin	What are good places to eat brunch at ? ?
tr	Fin	My bday is Saturday :) and I wanna have breakfast / lunch with my fam .
tr	Fin	Oh and btw I live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^ _ ^
tr	Fin	Don ' t be in a hurry though .
tr	Fin	Just relax and enjoy .
tr	Fin	They have fabulous French toast too .
tr	Fin	There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot .
tr	Fin	Plenty of parking on the weekends .. during the week please park in the little lot across the street .
tr	Fin	Directions from the Kennedy : Take the Ogden Exit off the Kennedy .
tr	Fin	Go three lights down and take a right onto Ogden .
tr	Fin	Continue two blocks to Hubbard and take another right .

tr	Fin	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Fin	If yes , was Canada involved in this act / law ?
tr	Fin	Sorry , I ' m just very nervous after watching the movie .
tr	Fin	SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ), which is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
tr	Fin	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Fin	Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock .
tr	Fin	SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on .
tr	Fin	We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .
tr	Fin	Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
tr	Fin	This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
tr	Fin	Don ' t worry .
tr	Fin	When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
tr	Fin	What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
tr	Fin	I ' ll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
tr	Fin	I ' m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
tr	Fin	How is the night life in Naha ?
tr	Fin	Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
tr	Fin	Go to a sumo tournament .
tr	Fin	Eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
tr	Fin	Climb Mount Fuji .
tr	Fin	Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
tr	Fin	There ' s the market in Naha , which is great .
tr	Fin	Try the local sake too if you can .
tr	Fin	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Fin	I ' m not sure that there ' s much nightlife in Naha .
tr	Fin	It ' s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
tr	Fin	Naha ' s not a very big city .
tr	Fin	My brother said they only had full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
tr	Fin	My questions are ..
tr	Fin	1 ) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16 ?
tr	Fin	To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
tr	Fin	He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
tr	Fin	As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming .
tr	Fin	Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
tr	Fin	The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
tr	Fin	1 ) modern m16 is alright .
tr	Fin	Vietnam m16 used to clog up and never work .
tr	Fin	2 ) All M16 ' s are either automatic or semi automatic .
tr	Fin	No one uses 3 burst .
tr	Fin	you play too much cod ; P
tr	Fin	modern m16 is best
tr	Fin	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Fin	Are the hotels back up and running ?
tr	Fin	Are there still aftershocks ?
tr	Fin	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Fin	Rotorua is fine .
tr	Fin	I ' m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
tr	Fin	Have fun in New Zealand !!
tr	Fin	Just recently discovered them last time I was down there , they ' re very nice ) www . kaffeeeis . co . nz
tr	Fin	Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you ' ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
tr	Fin	In case of an earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and don ' t go outside as possible debris will fall .
tr	Fin	Yes it ' s ok .
tr	Fin	Im around 5 ' 2 - 5 ' 4 , 11 years old and im wondering what size horse i ' ll need that i wont grow out of quickly ?
tr	Fin	"It ' s "" tall "" being it ' s bigger than a pony , but it ' s on the small end for a horse ."
tr	Fin	"I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5 ' 11 "" but my horse is about 16 . 2 or 16 . 3hh , TB ."
tr	Fin	"So don ' t be afraid to get something a little bigger than "" perfect "" just in case you hit a growth spurt ."
tr	Fin	Keep that in mind .
tr	Fin	Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
tr	Fin	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Fin	"i ' m5 ' 3 - 4 "" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14 . 2hh and she ' s perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i can ' t bareback , not yet"
tr	Fin	If you Don ' t want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
tr	Fin	Hope I helped :)
tr	Fin	Where in the world is Iguazu ?
tr	Fin	However , save some of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River .
tr	Fin	The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
tr	Fin	The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil , which is equally close .
tr	Fin	Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
tr	Fin	The bus is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours , although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats .
tr	Fin	The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
tr	Fin	Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .
tr	Fin	For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls .
tr	Fin	I have never been anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help !!!!
tr	Fin	you speak the language and will have more fun .
tr	Fin	The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
tr	Fin	London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
tr	Fin	You will be able to have a good time there .
tr	Fin	Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners .
tr	Fin	However , outside Paris everybody is wonderful .
tr	Fin	Nobody likes the Parisians , even then Parisians don ' t like Parisians .
tr	Fin	South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
tr	Fin	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Fin	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Fin	Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
tr	Fin	However , if you ' re allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
tr	Fin	I lived there for 8 months .
tr	Fin	If your French is good / moderate , then head to Paris without a doubt .
tr	Fin	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
tr	Fin	There is NO such thing as a BTA .
tr	Fin	That is a term invented by online romance scammers
tr	Fin	""" Second only to flight money , the Basic Travel Allowance ( BTA ) is the scammers highest paying income ."
tr	Fin	Let ’ s get this over with now …
tr	Fin	"THERE IS NO SUCH THING any more , anywhere , it ’ s an online dating scam ."""
tr	Fin	""" THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BASIC TRAVEL ALLOWANCE !!"
tr	Fin	Please remember : there is NO such thing .
tr	Fin	There is NO such requirement , in any country of the world .
tr	Fin	"This is an invention of the scammers . """
tr	Fin	Just pray that you have not ever given this criminal enough information for your identity to be stolen - your full name , birthdate , home address , etc or that you were not conned into sending money .
tr	Fin	Contact the Anti - Fraud Centre to report this http :// www . antifraudcentre - centreantifraude . ca / english / home - eng . html
tr	Fin	BTA only exists in the mind of SCAMMERS .
tr	Fin	cut of all contact and tighten up your PC security .
tr	Fin	"There is no such thing as a BTA or "" Basic Travel Allowance ""- this is 100 % a scam - as the first poster said , cut off any and all contact with this person - they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be ."
tr	Fin	The below site from the US government verifies this - it ' s the same for Canada , too .....
tr	Fin	i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
tr	Fin	"He ' s the issue , you are trying to "" Make "" them mate ."
tr	Fin	First you need a compatible pair .
tr	Fin	Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other , so there is hope there .
tr	Fin	Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
tr	Fin	"This may be around 1 / 2 of their full adult size , probably 4 - 5 "" for those guys ."
tr	Fin	The difference is what they need to live , VS what ' s ideal for them .
tr	Fin	Get that right , and they will mate when THEY are ready .
tr	Fin	Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed .
tr	Fin	Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other .
tr	Fin	Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Fin	The p H should be 6 . 5 - 7 .
tr	Fin	Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Fin	Then add the other mate .
tr	Fin	When the males aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
tr	Fin	The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them .
tr	Fin	Turn the water temp up to 82 degrees
tr	Fin	Please help with my cats bladder issue ?
tr	Fin	I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
tr	Fin	When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
tr	Fin	I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
tr	Fin	What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first ?
tr	Fin	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Fin	First of all , I am very sorry to hear you ' re having this issue with your cat . :(
tr	Fin	Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
tr	Fin	Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones , but these usually are frequent visits , with small amounts of urine being passed .
tr	Fin	If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
tr	Fin	Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
tr	Fin	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Fin	In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .

tr	Fin	What is Italian High Renaissance ?
tr	Fin	Have a look at this , it may help .
tr	Fin	1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .
tr	Fin	The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .
tr	Fin	Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
tr	Fin	The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ rebirth ”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .
tr	Fin	2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .
tr	Fin	Hope it helps !
tr	Fin	I ' m American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
tr	Fin	I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
tr	Fin	I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really don ' t have the money for .
tr	Fin	I ' m really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
tr	Fin	There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that .
tr	Fin	Above is the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , including passport information .
tr	Fin	It is free .
tr	Fin	I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U . K .
tr	Fin	You should be fine with just a passport , unless you ' re staying longer than six months .
tr	Fin	I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
tr	Fin	I visited London , Edinburgh , and St . Andrews so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
tr	Fin	Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you ' ll be fine .
tr	Fin	That tactic never failed me .
tr	Fin	i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
tr	Fin	There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
tr	Fin	Silkies have hookless feathers .
tr	Fin	Sussexs have soft feathers .
tr	Fin	Skin Color : Silkies have black skin color , which is dominate .
tr	Fin	Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate .
tr	Fin	Either way rec . and dom . white genes dilute the black gene .
tr	Fin	Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies .
tr	Fin	Comb Type : Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) single is also there , but is recessive .
tr	Fin	Five Toes : Silkies have five toes .
tr	Fin	Sussex have four toes .
tr	Fin	Silkie crosses are great birds , and very neat looking .
tr	Fin	Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
tr	Fin	I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 .
tr	Fin	http :// i . imgur . com / S2MD2 . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / T2zff . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / Xytex . jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 ( see links above ).
tr	Fin	The lighting was not the best , but the pics turned out ok in my opinion .
tr	Fin	you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
tr	Fin	[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
tr	Fin	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Fin	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
tr	Fin	There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
tr	Fin	In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a corner of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord .
tr	Fin	Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I dont think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
tr	Fin	what are some unique customs in ireland ?
tr	Fin	As far ask I ’ m aware our most unique custom would be the “ Country Wake ”.
tr	Fin	The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .
tr	Fin	Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
tr	Fin	The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
tr	Fin	Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
tr	Fin	I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
tr	Fin	the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
tr	Fin	I ' m unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn ' t react to seeing another cat on TV .
tr	Fin	I heard that a company ( here is a link : http :// news . yahoo . com / nestl - purina - releases - commercial - aimed - dogs - 183443091 . html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans can ' t hear .
tr	Fin	Well , T . V . is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture .
tr	Fin	So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
tr	Fin	So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T . V ., it ’ s probably because of the sounds .
tr	Fin	Yes they do .
tr	Fin	im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
tr	Fin	I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
tr	Fin	So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
tr	Fin	If they ask how much I ' m willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
tr	Fin	I saw a site that charges $ 0 . 70 per mile .
tr	Fin	Is that reasonable ?
tr	Fin	Remember that you get what you pay for .
tr	Fin	Three hours isn ' t far , but you are doing multiple shows .
tr	Fin	Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
tr	Fin	I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
tr	Fin	He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
tr	Fin	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Fin	See link below .
tr	Fin	Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
tr	Fin	I want to take a cruise around the world .
tr	Fin	I mean literally around the world if possible .
tr	Fin	Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to ?
tr	Fin	But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere .
tr	Fin	1 . Here ' s a site that lists world cruises including prices .
tr	Fin	You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ).
tr	Fin	yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
tr	Fin	so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40K at least .
tr	Fin	Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
tr	Fin	The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
tr	Fin	The Mission was basically latin - american .
tr	Fin	As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
tr	Fin	So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that ' s because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that ' s who the photographers took pictures of .
tr	Fin	Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
tr	Fin	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Fin	You never saw black MUNI drivers , Asian police , Latino politicians until then .
tr	Fin	It was an evolution .
tr	Fin	We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then .
tr	Fin	We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
tr	Fin	Only Caucasians had any political power , corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods .
tr	Fin	We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
tr	Fin	San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically .
tr	Fin	The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
tr	Fin	EDIT : My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time .
tr	Fin	We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
tr	Fin	There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
tr	Fin	However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
tr	Fin	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Fin	My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
tr	Fin	I just wanna make sure :) Thank !
tr	Fin	Yes , but be sure that your chickens are all hens ( I mean not roosters ), Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving , so be aware of that , hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !
tr	Fin	From my experience Hens ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc .
tr	Fin	Be sure not to feed your rabbits non - veg items !
tr	Fin	You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , don ' t put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
tr	Fin	So , don ' t put both of them in one cage .
tr	Fin	yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
tr	Fin	So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
tr	Fin	rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that .
tr	Fin	Molten brass is damn hot and usually it ' s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
tr	Fin	Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
tr	Fin	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Fin	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Fin	Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Fin	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e . g . for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ).
tr	Fin	I melt brass and cast it http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm
tr	Fin	Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
tr	Fin	You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
tr	Fin	I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http :// www . mikegigi . com / meltmetl . htm and http :// www . mikegigi . com / firehole . htm
tr	Fin	Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
tr	Fin	Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
tr	Fin	Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
tr	Fin	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Fin	We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
tr	Fin	Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch .
tr	Fin	Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
tr	Fin	I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
tr	Fin	When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
tr	Fin	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Fin	Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
tr	Fin	To prevent animal cruelty , many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat .
tr	Fin	Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
tr	Fin	When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
tr	Fin	She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
tr	Fin	I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I ' m 14 by the way
tr	Fin	Lay some knowledge on them dude .
tr	Fin	Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
tr	Fin	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Fin	Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
tr	Fin	My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .
tr	Fin	Be persistent , but don ' t pester them about it cause that ' ll get you nowhere fast .
tr	Fin	My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
tr	Fin	1 . Be responsible .
tr	Fin	Do all your chores without being nagged , take care of any existing pets , keep your room clean , and so on .
tr	Fin	Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
tr	Fin	2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
tr	Fin	3 . Bargain with them .
tr	Fin	Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
tr	Fin	4 . Play the sympathy card .
tr	Fin	On the fear angle -- talk her into coming to the pet store with you .
tr	Fin	Once you ' re there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
tr	Fin	Once you ' re holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
tr	Fin	My Snake ' s meal is TOO big , what can I do ?
tr	Fin	Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ).
tr	Fin	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Fin	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Fin	So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
tr	Fin	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
tr	Fin	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
tr	Fin	My opinion - take it for what it ' s worth … :-)
tr	Fin	I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
tr	Fin	"It is full of gay friendly "" everything ""."
tr	Fin	Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
tr	Fin	Start your process here , if you haven ' t already .
tr	Fin	"A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
tr	Fin	Lets be clear about this ...........
tr	Fin	It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
tr	Fin	So don ' t pack your bags , yet .
tr	Fin	Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
tr	Fin	You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
tr	Fin	Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .
tr	Fin	I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
tr	Fin	I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it didn ' t help .
tr	Fin	Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
tr	Fin	He is really excited about anybody he see .
tr	Fin	thank you very much .
tr	Fin	Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
tr	Fin	You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
tr	Fin	This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
tr	Fin	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Fin	Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
tr	Fin	Patience is the key here .
tr	Fin	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Fin	And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold .
tr	Fin	Never train out of fear .
tr	Fin	You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
tr	Fin	Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
tr	Fin	or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
tr	Fin	try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
tr	Fin	This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
tr	Fin	Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
tr	Fin	Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice .
tr	Fin	Rooms start from 500 per double .
tr	Fin	Those ones are quite small .
tr	Fin	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Fin	But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
tr	Fin	Also , while travelling ask people where they ' ve been and if they have any hotel recommendations .
tr	Fin	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Fin	It was quite easy to find something .
tr	Fin	( Dont stay in Agra too long .
tr	Fin	One night is enough !)
tr	Fin	There were many hotels there .
tr	Fin	Good luck , enjoy your time !
tr	Fin	it is in karol bagh .
tr	Fin	some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it .
tr	Fin	which one out of these makes the best pet ?
tr	Fin	and why is the one a better pet ?
tr	Fin	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Fin	I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
tr	Fin	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
tr	Fin	So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
tr	Fin	So my opinion is Guinea pigs .
tr	Fin	Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
tr	Fin	Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
tr	Fin	They ' re incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
tr	Fin	"Mine learned to "" go to the bathroom "" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch ."
tr	Fin	That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
tr	Fin	They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
tr	Fin	Never had / handled a Degu .
tr	Fin	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Fin	We have two .
tr	Fin	They are social and like to be handled .
tr	Fin	You have to have two because they don ' t do well alone .
tr	Fin	Make certain you get two females .
tr	Fin	They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots .
tr	Fin	Don ' t feed them broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest .
tr	Fin	Need Advice !?
tr	Fin	I wanted to volunteer and help animals , and decided to try fostering kittens .
tr	Fin	This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wits end .
tr	Fin	They track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed ....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything , including my bare legs !
tr	Fin	My legs and hands are just full of scratches .
tr	Fin	I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
tr	Fin	My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
tr	Fin	That ' s kind of the way it goes .. lol .
tr	Fin	Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring .
tr	Fin	If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
tr	Fin	Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
tr	Fin	For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
tr	Fin	Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator .
tr	Fin	To some degree you can / should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately .
tr	Fin	But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ' ll be interacting with the kittens .
tr	Fin	Then take care of yourself .
tr	Fin	Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
tr	Fin	Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
tr	Fin	Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
tr	Fin	If you still don ' t enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
tr	Fin	I find the adults are much easier .
tr	Fin	Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back !
tr	Fin	And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
tr	Fin	Take the kittens back to the shelter .
tr	Fin	Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
tr	Fin	what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Fin	what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Fin	It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
tr	Fin	Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child ' s birth at the town hall / registrar ' s office .
tr	Fin	Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
tr	Fin	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Fin	This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
tr	Fin	You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
tr	Fin	None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .
tr	Fin	Start here if you were born in Ontario .
tr	Fin	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Fin	I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
tr	Fin	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Fin	ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD * BOTH * !!
tr	Fin	i want to know which you liked better and WHY ?
tr	Fin	include which one had :
tr	Fin	- AND JUST MORE STUFF YOU LIKED OVERALL
tr	Fin	please specify which royal or carnival ship (:
tr	Fin	Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .
tr	Fin	Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
tr	Fin	Are there any major differences between them ?
tr	Fin	Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best .
tr	Fin	For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Fin	Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St . Thomas , the Bahamas and St . Martin / St . Maarten .
tr	Fin	The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
tr	Fin	The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ).
tr	Fin	We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don ' t believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
tr	Fin	Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .
tr	Fin	Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
tr	Fin	We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
tr	Fin	On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
tr	Fin	If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
tr	Fin	Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Fin	We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Fin	Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
tr	Fin	We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
tr	Fin	Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
tr	Fin	They both had pools for kids and adults .
tr	Fin	We liked the Liberty ' s pools better because one had a slide .
tr	Fin	If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
tr	Fin	Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
tr	Fin	Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas .
tr	Fin	Look on their website rssc . com
tr	Fin	What countries are the best to travel to ?
tr	Fin	I really want to travel when I leave school !
tr	Fin	( I Have 1 year before collage !)
tr	Fin	I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
tr	Fin	There are 50 of them , 48 located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between .
tr	Fin	There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
tr	Fin	Amount of time could be dependent on so many things .
tr	Fin	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Fin	Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ' ll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you ' re there .
tr	Fin	I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
tr	Fin	come to Africa .
tr	Fin	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Fin	the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ), but others will work just as well .
tr	Fin	close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
tr	Fin	let him out for half an hour , to explore .
tr	Fin	then put him back in .
tr	Fin	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Fin	remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
tr	Fin	remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
tr	Fin	Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
tr	Fin	they just do it on their own .
tr	Fin	I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
tr	Fin	Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
tr	Fin	( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
tr	Fin	Its very frustrating .
tr	Fin	I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
tr	Fin	I trained her myself .
tr	Fin	She tosses me around like its nothing !
tr	Fin	... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
tr	Fin	Is there any tricks I could use ?
tr	Fin	Maybe get a book on training .
tr	Fin	You have to be in command at all times .
tr	Fin	There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
tr	Fin	Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
tr	Fin	Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
tr	Fin	Later do it again .
tr	Fin	When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
tr	Fin	Put something fun inside .
tr	Fin	Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason .
tr	Fin	Do not shut the door .
tr	Fin	Let him walk in and out for a few days .
tr	Fin	Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
tr	Fin	With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
tr	Fin	Try obedience classes .
tr	Fin	Have patience with him , you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home .
tr	Fin	will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
tr	Fin	or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
tr	Fin	If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
tr	Fin	Also , any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well .
tr	Fin	Thank you !
tr	Fin	I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
tr	Fin	Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
tr	Fin	I am just a satisfied customer .
tr	Fin	And don ' t expect to party on this tour .
tr	Fin	The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
tr	Fin	Oh , if you are confused .
tr	Fin	Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe .
tr	Fin	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Fin	have fun .
tr	Fin	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Fin	Most of the tourists that I ' ve come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
tr	Fin	You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
tr	Fin	The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
tr	Fin	PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken ' s hotel .
tr	Fin	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Fin	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Fin	Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
tr	Fin	We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
tr	Fin	We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
tr	Fin	Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
tr	Fin	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Fin	I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
tr	Fin	But there are just so many poses and programs !
tr	Fin	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Fin	I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
tr	Fin	I also have back problems that transfer into my legs .
tr	Fin	Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
tr	Fin	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Fin	Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
tr	Fin	Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
tr	Fin	Now not only is my leg better , but my back is relaxing .
tr	Fin	with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it ' s forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
tr	Fin	My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
tr	Fin	I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water .
tr	Fin	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Fin	The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
tr	Fin	So my question is ..
tr	Fin	Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
tr	Fin	... Some help would be great .
tr	Fin	thank you :)
tr	Fin	I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
tr	Fin	Thank you for the help .
tr	Fin	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Fin	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Fin	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .
tr	Fin	1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
tr	Fin	3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
tr	Fin	It could be due to nausea or any number of things .
tr	Fin	From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .
tr	Fin	4 ) Call your vet .
tr	Fin	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
tr	Fin	No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can .
tr	Fin	You need to ask your vet these questions .
tr	Fin	My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
tr	Fin	I ' m in my 20 ' s and currently studying in France .
tr	Fin	In addition , from my understanding one - on - one dates is something that comes much later and not ' straight - away ' like us anglo - saxons .
tr	Fin	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
tr	Fin	Is it true ?
tr	Fin	She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
tr	Fin	She is also nicer when we are both alone .
tr	Fin	However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
tr	Fin	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
tr	Fin	My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along .
tr	Fin	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
tr	Fin	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Fin	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
tr	Fin	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
tr	Fin	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
tr	Fin	Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
tr	Fin	""" Non !"" means "" non "", not "" I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case ."""
tr	Fin	Christiane gave you a good answer .
tr	Fin	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there ' s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
tr	Fin	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Fin	True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
tr	Fin	There are no jobs in this country .
tr	Fin	Is there a future for our nation ' s youth ?
tr	Fin	I ' m two years into an undergraduate degree .
tr	Fin	Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
tr	Fin	Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas , to Australia , etc .
tr	Fin	There ' s obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc .)
tr	Fin	I really like you ' re answer .
tr	Fin	it ' s very logical .
tr	Fin	I also wish I ' d applied for a scholarship .
tr	Fin	Obviously I ' m still completely stupid though .
tr	Fin	I mean , I wasn ' t smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
tr	Fin	And yes , I am being melodramatic .
tr	Fin	Your answer is very sweet , but I ' m not compassionate towards teenage high school students .
tr	Fin	Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting , but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications ?
tr	Fin	I also know that you don ' t get paid that much more in Australia than you do here .
tr	Fin	And it ' s not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
tr	Fin	Try living in Sydney on a teacher ' s salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
tr	Fin	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
tr	Fin	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Fin	At the moment there ' s no interest , but that ' ll probably change .
tr	Fin	I guess I ' m extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree .
tr	Fin	But I worked hard and I ' m still working hard .
tr	Fin	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
tr	Fin	Get an education !
tr	Fin	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Fin	It depends on what you hunger for .
tr	Fin	That means making yourself known ; that means networking .
tr	Fin	i have a baby eastern king snake .
tr	Fin	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Fin	as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
tr	Fin	( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won ' t eat .)
tr	Fin	i handle him every few days .
tr	Fin	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Fin	i just love him to death .
tr	Fin	he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
tr	Fin	i am very discouraged and sad and i don ' t know what to do .
tr	Fin	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Fin	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
tr	Fin	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Fin	Remember snakes can go awhile without eating .
tr	Fin	King snakes sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
tr	Fin	They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
tr	Fin	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Fin	Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
tr	Fin	It ' s natural and so long as you don ' t see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
tr	Fin	You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
tr	Fin	They ' re fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
tr	Fin	hope this helped .
tr	Fin	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Fin	It ' s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
tr	Fin	how rough is too rough ?
tr	Fin	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Fin	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Fin	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Fin	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
tr	Fin	any answers help !!!!!!
tr	Fin	you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
tr	Fin	put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
tr	Fin	then let her out for ten minutes .
tr	Fin	make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
tr	Fin	she knows she is invading someone else ' s territory , but can ' t help it , and has no where to go .
tr	Fin	she will be able to sleep without being afraid .
tr	Fin	as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
tr	Fin	this is not good .
tr	Fin	give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
tr	Fin	hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .
tr	Fin	if that happens , separate them , and give them time apart .
tr	Fin	"A hiss is basically a "" get the f * ck away "" sound ."
tr	Fin	It means they ' ve gone too far .
tr	Fin	When they start bleeding that means they ' re really fighting .
tr	Fin	I have two cats , and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
tr	Fin	The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
tr	Fin	That means they are fighting .
tr	Fin	When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing .
tr	Fin	What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?
tr	Fin	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Fin	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Fin	Thing is , it worked .
tr	Fin	When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia .
tr	Fin	All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated .
tr	Fin	The Communists agreed .
tr	Fin	The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
tr	Fin	THAT WAS THE PLAN .
tr	Fin	What happened ?
tr	Fin	The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas .
tr	Fin	The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked .
tr	Fin	When give the ultimate choice , they rallied …
tr	Fin	Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
tr	Fin	The people rejected their attempt to topple the government , and for all intents and purposes the US military ( and the ARVN ) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time - frame he ordered it .
tr	Fin	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Fin	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Fin	They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it .
tr	Fin	In the end Nixon kept his promise for “… peace with honor ….”
tr	Fin	But that ’ s another question .
tr	Fin	In that , they pretty much succeeded .
tr	Fin	Before Tet , the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA .
tr	Fin	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Fin	There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
tr	Fin	Try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
tr	Fin	I just bought a baby one yesterday .
tr	Fin	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Fin	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Fin	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
tr	Fin	Thank you for your time .
tr	Fin	"Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "" light ,"" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
tr	Fin	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
tr	Fin	The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed ' s Repsitun model : http :// lllreptile . com / store / catalog / reptile - supplies / uvb - fluorescent - lights - mercury - vapor - bulbs /-/ zoo - med - 24 - repti - sun - 100 - fluorescent - bulb / Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .
tr	Fin	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
tr	Fin	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Fin	Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
tr	Fin	Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
tr	Fin	Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .
tr	Fin	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Fin	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Fin	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Fin	That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
tr	Fin	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Fin	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Fin	I tell all my customers they can try it , but don ' t count on it .
tr	Fin	Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach .
tr	Fin	Is a finch or a parakeet better ?
tr	Fin	Please help me !
tr	Fin	oh and please say y one is better thx !!!!!!
tr	Fin	Please choose the parakeet ...
tr	Fin	Heres my reason .....
tr	Fin	I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
tr	Fin	I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
tr	Fin	At first it was all cool and all .
tr	Fin	After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
tr	Fin	They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them .
tr	Fin	I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
tr	Fin	I still have them and they are doing well .
tr	Fin	A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
tr	Fin	They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
tr	Fin	I love them .
tr	Fin	First of all they are very tame .
tr	Fin	I tamed them in 4 days .
tr	Fin	The whole family loves them .
tr	Fin	My parents even plays with them .
tr	Fin	They are a big part of our family .
tr	Fin	I hope this helps you with your decision .
tr	Fin	They are both about the same noise level .
tr	Fin	When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
tr	Fin	Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
tr	Fin	the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .
tr	Fin	( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
tr	Fin	If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
tr	Fin	The girl has either pink or brown .
tr	Fin	But get either one male and one female , or two males .
tr	Fin	Do not get two females .
tr	Fin	I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
tr	Fin	They are the best !
tr	Fin	If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
tr	Fin	However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
tr	Fin	My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
tr	Fin	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Fin	These are the steps I used .
tr	Fin	1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
tr	Fin	Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
tr	Fin	2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .
tr	Fin	I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
tr	Fin	Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
tr	Fin	( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
tr	Fin	Do this for about one hour .
tr	Fin	Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .
tr	Fin	Push you finger to their feet gently and say up .
tr	Fin	4 ) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying .
tr	Fin	Do not hit , yell , or harm them .
tr	Fin	You have patience .
tr	Fin	Dont give up !
tr	Fin	After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
tr	Fin	and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
tr	Fin	They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !
tr	Fin	They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Fin	And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
tr	Fin	a parakeet is friendlier
tr	Fin	They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
tr	Fin	They are also friendly .
tr	Fin	I have a parakeet named Cookie . : P
tr	Fin	When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
tr	Fin	I graduate in the spring , and so we ' d like to go between then and winter .
tr	Fin	We ' re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we ' re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
tr	Fin	One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
tr	Fin	It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
tr	Fin	And then there ’ s the rain .
tr	Fin	Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
tr	Fin	The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
tr	Fin	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Fin	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Fin	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Fin	Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
tr	Fin	Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country ’ s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
tr	Fin	Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid - July – again , it ’ s all part of the uncertainty principle .
tr	Fin	Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ’ s Festival .
tr	Fin	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Fin	Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
tr	Fin	"As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "" there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes """
tr	Fin	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Fin	If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
tr	Fin	The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ?).
tr	Fin	Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
tr	Fin	Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
tr	Fin	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
tr	Fin	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Fin	We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
tr	Fin	Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
tr	Fin	The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
tr	Fin	We had frosts in October so I wouldn ' t advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
tr	Fin	I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish .
tr	Fin	1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long .
tr	Fin	2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5cm long .
tr	Fin	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Fin	I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday .
tr	Fin	If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive !
tr	Fin	I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
tr	Fin	Worms ( and Daphnia ) are also rich in Lipids , substances important in forming eggs and growing young .
tr	Fin	I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males .
tr	Fin	If you have plants in your tank .
tr	Fin	If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .
tr	Fin	Checkout the second source .
tr	Fin	I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .
tr	Fin	Use a well rinsed medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non - crumbly styrofoam to float them .
tr	Fin	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
tr	Fin	They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
tr	Fin	The water changes help with that too .
tr	Fin	The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
tr	Fin	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Fin	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Fin	3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?
tr	Fin	That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .
tr	Fin	They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ).
tr	Fin	A number of minerals are not of much consequence .
tr	Fin	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Fin	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Fin	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
tr	Fin	But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
tr	Fin	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Fin	Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .
tr	Fin	Get those out ASAP too .
tr	Fin	Hope there is useful grist for the mill here .
tr	Fin	What is the best time of year ?
tr	Fin	It is vacation time .
tr	Fin	Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
tr	Fin	They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
tr	Fin	What is the best option ?
tr	Fin	Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
tr	Fin	There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
tr	Fin	This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
tr	Fin	There are two ships , Disney magic and Disney wonder .
tr	Fin	Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
tr	Fin	The ship offers variety of eatables , deliciously made .
tr	Fin	Sea fishes , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard .
tr	Fin	There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
tr	Fin	There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
tr	Fin	These theme parks have all types of facilities .
tr	Fin	It is really an entertainment for the kids .
tr	Fin	The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
tr	Fin	There are other amnesties also .
tr	Fin	These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
tr	Fin	There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
tr	Fin	Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
tr	Fin	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Fin	Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
tr	Fin	Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there .
tr	Fin	They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
tr	Fin	We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
tr	Fin	Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
tr	Fin	All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
tr	Fin	We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we ' had ' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
tr	Fin	Any time would be great .
tr	Fin	off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season .
tr	Fin	My wife and I , in our 60 ' s at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
tr	Fin	We had a ball .
tr	Fin	We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
tr	Fin	There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
tr	Fin	There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
tr	Fin	You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
tr	Fin	If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
tr	Fin	The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
tr	Fin	Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife ' s taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
tr	Fin	Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
tr	Fin	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Fin	If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
tr	Fin	but food is always available and it is consistently good .
tr	Fin	I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
tr	Fin	This is about my farrier , girls .
tr	Fin	That ' s why I ' m posting here !
tr	Fin	I posted this in singles and dating too , so I ' ve just copied and pasted .
tr	Fin	He is my farrier ( shoes my horses feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
tr	Fin	Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty .
tr	Fin	He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
tr	Fin	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Fin	He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
tr	Fin	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Fin	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Fin	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Fin	It ' s a father and son business .
tr	Fin	Thank you for reading if you did ! :)
tr	Fin	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Fin	This is about the fourth time they ' ve done my horse ' s feet because I just switched back to them .
tr	Fin	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Fin	So , obviously I switched back to these guys .
tr	Fin	Ok , calm down , it ' s not like he ' s some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
tr	Fin	I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
tr	Fin	He is a few years older than me .
tr	Fin	And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
tr	Fin	"It ' s always just "" Okay , they ' re feet need to be done , better call the farrier ."""
tr	Fin	And they usually come out within a few days .
tr	Fin	Sounds like He really likes you ..
tr	Fin	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
tr	Fin	or is he Not your type ?
tr	Fin	Or are you undecided ?
tr	Fin	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
tr	Fin	When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby ..( for those who don ' t Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
tr	Fin	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Fin	sorta wonder what it would have been like ?
tr	Fin	But That was Years ago .
tr	Fin	He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
tr	Fin	Well one day he said to me You know i don ' t wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
tr	Fin	Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn ' t see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
tr	Fin	I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
tr	Fin	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Fin	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Fin	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Fin	This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
tr	Fin	Might be something different ?
tr	Fin	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Fin	He ' s not lame , but he ' s been having issues .
tr	Fin	Here ' s what the owner has said :
tr	Fin	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Fin	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Fin	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
tr	Fin	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ).
tr	Fin	Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .
tr	Fin	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Fin	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
tr	Fin	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
tr	Fin	My other theory would be wobblers .
tr	Fin	Horse is out of state and not local .
tr	Fin	Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .
tr	Fin	Worse comes to worse , I ' m out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
tr	Fin	He ' s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
tr	Fin	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Fin	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
tr	Fin	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Fin	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
tr	Fin	The owner is the one who is unable .
tr	Fin	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Fin	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Fin	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Fin	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
tr	Fin	I know this is going to be expensive .
tr	Fin	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Fin	Looked at studies , treatment options and such .
tr	Fin	The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
tr	Fin	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Fin	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Fin	Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .
tr	Fin	Is that something you are up for ?
tr	Fin	If so go for it and I ' ll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .
tr	Fin	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Fin	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
tr	Fin	Pretty much every large stable has here .
tr	Fin	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
tr	Fin	That horse returned to racing and we didn ' t notice much difference .
tr	Fin	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Fin	One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM .
tr	Fin	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
tr	Fin	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Fin	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Fin	I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM .
tr	Fin	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Fin	Let us know what you decide to do .
tr	Fin	You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I don ' t think I could take in a horse right now these issues .
tr	Fin	Personally I think you should just keep on walking by .
tr	Fin	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Fin	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
tr	Fin	So all in all , put the money up front before taking on this horse .
tr	Fin	Was it always like this ?
tr	Fin	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Fin	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
tr	Fin	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Fin	Do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get your hair straightened .
tr	Fin	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .

tr	Fin	They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes .
tr	Fin	I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
tr	Fin	This is a perfect place to get your hair done .
tr	Fin	When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
tr	Fin	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Fin	Highly Recommend
tr	Fin	No matter what state I am in when I arrive , I always leave feeling better .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend her .
tr	Fin	What a fantastic store , I love this place .
tr	Fin	Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
tr	Fin	Their items are very unique , great quality , great prices .
tr	Fin	They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
tr	Fin	Dr . Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
tr	Fin	Dr . Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .
tr	Fin	She is and excellent doctor to have on one ' s team .
tr	Fin	Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST !
tr	Fin	My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re - wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
tr	Fin	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
tr	Fin	He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
tr	Fin	I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
tr	Fin	Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish .
tr	Fin	They set out to exceed your expectations .
tr	Fin	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
tr	Fin	I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
tr	Fin	I hope they get there act together ...
tr	Fin	I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS .
tr	Fin	THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY .
tr	Fin	PLEASE DON ' T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DON ' T WANT TO : CRY , HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE .
tr	Fin	You ' ve Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
tr	Fin	"Beats having one "" cleaning lady "" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "" maids "" did !"
tr	Fin	This place has the best baby and childrens clothes .
tr	Fin	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
tr	Fin	I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
tr	Fin	Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it .
tr	Fin	I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
tr	Fin	I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago .
tr	Fin	I wanted to try someplace new again .
tr	Fin	This place rocked .
tr	Fin	Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good ..
tr	Fin	We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
tr	Fin	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Fin	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
tr	Fin	DO NOT GO HERE !!!
tr	Fin	I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
tr	Fin	I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
tr	Fin	I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like its getting infected .
tr	Fin	I ' m certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong .
tr	Fin	Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
tr	Fin	This town needs some food soul and this is not it .
tr	Fin	My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
tr	Fin	Then the desserts came , and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had .
tr	Fin	It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Fin	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Fin	Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
tr	Fin	Tiger Heating is awesome .
tr	Fin	I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
tr	Fin	These guys were absolutely professional .
tr	Fin	John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
tr	Fin	My family and I thank you !!!!!!!!!!
tr	Fin	They Suck
tr	Fin	Go somewhere else ...
tr	Fin	Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700 .
tr	Fin	Parts department blows , Service department is even worse .
tr	Fin	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
tr	Fin	His knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application , ensuring compliance with the building regulations .
tr	Fin	We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close .
tr	Fin	Got the crab rangoon which was great , tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good .
tr	Fin	Bea was really nice and asked how the food was .
tr	Fin	However , I still like this place a lot .
tr	Fin	Margaritas are alright .
tr	Fin	My only complaint is the QUESO .
tr	Fin	It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
tr	Fin	Queso should not be watery :( .....
tr	Fin	*** update *** NEVER MIND !
tr	Fin	They fixed the queso !
tr	Fin	Thankyouthankyou
tr	Fin	There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston .... don ' t . waste your time here .
tr	Fin	I had the morelias enchiladas .
tr	Fin	The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good . at all .
tr	Fin	In fact my friend vomited after our meal .
tr	Fin	Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
tr	Fin	Service was okay not great , we came for a late lunch .
tr	Fin	James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
tr	Fin	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
tr	Fin	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Fin	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
tr	Fin	That did it for me .. no more Raina ' s .
tr	Fin	Besides parking is a pain .. cramped and un - ruly with Kumon Parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees '
tr	Fin	Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
tr	Fin	I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I ' ve had with bigger offices and firms .
tr	Fin	Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
tr	Fin	I LOVE MY GYM !
tr	Fin	FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily .
tr	Fin	This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body don ' t be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
tr	Fin	This restaurant is over - rated .
tr	Fin	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Fin	The service is poor ...
tr	Fin	I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
tr	Fin	The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
tr	Fin	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
tr	Fin	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
tr	Fin	I ' m very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .
tr	Fin	Learn from a Cesar Gracie black belt and former ufc fighter !
tr	Fin	When i say jiu - jitsu or mma i mean it !
tr	Fin	Best jiu - jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up !
tr	Fin	If your coach has no fights and you never see him train and sweat something is wrong !
tr	Fin	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Fin	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Fin	Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
tr	Fin	They are very rude over the phone and in person .
tr	Fin	They talk down to you like they are supreme beings , if you hate your job so much then quit !!
tr	Fin	Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city .
tr	Fin	this is a good place
tr	Fin	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
tr	Fin	They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty .
tr	Fin	I enjoy going there although i ' ve only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
tr	Fin	i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
tr	Fin	Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
tr	Fin	A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
tr	Fin	Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
tr	Fin	Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
tr	Fin	The salesperson refused !
tr	Fin	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
tr	Fin	We were the only customers there !
tr	Fin	Don ' t waste time , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help their customers there !
tr	Fin	ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES .
tr	Fin	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
tr	Fin	SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
tr	Fin	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
tr	Fin	IF YOU WANT A STEAK , WELL , THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY .
tr	Fin	The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
tr	Fin	Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food .
tr	Fin	But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
tr	Fin	If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
tr	Fin	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Fin	I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
tr	Fin	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I ' ma bit surprised by other comments .
tr	Fin	She ' s very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
tr	Fin	Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
tr	Fin	great service / deals - support this local business
tr	Fin	They have the best prices locally and good customer service .
tr	Fin	One guy is a little surley , but who gives a crap as long as your car ' s work is outstanding .
tr	Fin	AND they ' re usually able to help you as a walk - in , and they ' re fast .
tr	Fin	Another great business bites the dust !
tr	Fin	The prices were worth what I got .
tr	Fin	What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you ' re in a small town rather than Baltimore .
tr	Fin	The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
tr	Fin	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
tr	Fin	The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
tr	Fin	Don ' t even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
tr	Fin	Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks .
tr	Fin	Service was excellent .
tr	Fin	Food was excellent .
tr	Fin	Wine was excellent .
tr	Fin	They interviewed me , gave me tests in the software I included on my resume , and placed me in a position that I kept for several years .
tr	Fin	Re - interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job .
tr	Fin	I ' m really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
tr	Fin	They are dependable , have great connections in the community , and are a great resource for finding a job .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend them to all of my friends !!!!!
tr	Fin	Great experience - consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder !
tr	Fin	I adopted a 3 . 5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
tr	Fin	The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding .
tr	Fin	If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don ' t forget to check out the shelters !
tr	Fin	My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family !
tr	Fin	No silverware , asked for a spoon for my sons mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon .
tr	Fin	Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got it .
tr	Fin	Never checked back with us once we got our food .
tr	Fin	Had to go the the bus boys station ourselves to get napkins .
tr	Fin	Only one server , too buys talking with others I guess .
tr	Fin	Food was good , but service means a lot to me .
tr	Fin	Dr . Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had .
tr	Fin	You are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
tr	Fin	I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now , However I am glad you are my dentist now .
tr	Fin	Even though you are expensive .
tr	Fin	Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth .
tr	Fin	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
tr	Fin	I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
tr	Fin	I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car wouldn ' t pass unless I replaced a hose .
tr	Fin	Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
tr	Fin	If you ' re a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
tr	Fin	If not , go somewhere else .
tr	Fin	even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
tr	Fin	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
tr	Fin	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
tr	Fin	What kind of rude service is that ?
tr	Fin	So here we are in Manson .
tr	Fin	And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
tr	Fin	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Fin	The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
tr	Fin	A lack of organisation , coupled with the distain for its customers , makes this the worst rental agency I have used .
tr	Fin	Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
tr	Fin	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Fin	Drinks were awesome , prices reasonable , and staff friendly .
tr	Fin	This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs .
tr	Fin	Check out The Willow Lounge , youll be happy !
tr	Fin	Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
tr	Fin	But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
tr	Fin	Don ' t let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !
tr	Fin	I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser ' s .
tr	Fin	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Fin	The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend Fraiser ' s for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
tr	Fin	I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
tr	Fin	This store is what Colorado is all about .
tr	Fin	Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
tr	Fin	It ' s durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
tr	Fin	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Fin	The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
tr	Fin	I recommend them highly !
tr	Fin	DONT ever go there , not even if your car flips .
tr	Fin	Their service sucks to start off with , people are cruel and ignorant .
tr	Fin	I ' m compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
tr	Fin	DO NOT EVER GO HERE .
tr	Fin	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
tr	Fin	And they THRIVE to get a customer .
tr	Fin	DO NOT go here .. thank you
tr	Fin	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Fin	My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
tr	Fin	This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
tr	Fin	Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
tr	Fin	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
tr	Fin	This is a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
tr	Fin	I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already .
tr	Fin	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
tr	Fin	Disgusting french fries is very best menu .
tr	Fin	Don ' t go , or you will learn how to waste your money .
tr	Fin	The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
tr	Fin	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
tr	Fin	Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
tr	Fin	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
tr	Fin	If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were .
tr	Fin	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Fin	The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal .
tr	Fin	Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
tr	Fin	This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
tr	Fin	The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
tr	Fin	It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
tr	Fin	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
tr	Fin	I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
tr	Fin	This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
tr	Fin	I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
tr	Fin	best quote ever My gate was stuck halfway open so I calledA CLASS Garage Doors Dr Services .
tr	Fin	They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
tr	Fin	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
tr	Fin	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
tr	Fin	I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired , I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
tr	Fin	You will be happy at this store !
tr	Fin	The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
tr	Fin	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Fin	The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
tr	Fin	They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
tr	Fin	Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car !
tr	Fin	I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
tr	Fin	Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first .
tr	Fin	"I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ..."" the inspection guy isn ' t here today "".... for example ."
tr	Fin	Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection ... but I was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had time to read a chapter in my book .
tr	Fin	As first - time home buyers , my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .
tr	Fin	She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
tr	Fin	Stephanie ' s knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
tr	Fin	We appreciated her patience , knowledge and kindness !
tr	Fin	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Fin	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
tr	Fin	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you ' ll be good .
tr	Fin	"Got some nice "" freshly baked "" fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine ."
tr	Fin	Took a bite , it tasted odd .
tr	Fin	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
tr	Fin	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Fin	She also refused to get a manager .
tr	Fin	I left my number , or tried to anyway .
tr	Fin	Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
tr	Fin	For cheap Chinese food , this is the place to go .
tr	Fin	I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .
tr	Fin	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin ' : sadface :
tr	Fin	My experience was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa .
tr	Fin	Jana Kueck was nothing but professional .
tr	Fin	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
tr	Fin	Jana made me feel very comfortable .
tr	Fin	Provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing .
tr	Fin	Equipment is state of the art .
tr	Fin	Dave is a patient and methodical teacher , who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take .
tr	Fin	Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
tr	Fin	Dave has much to offer .
tr	Fin	We love our new roof !
tr	Fin	We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job everyday .
tr	Fin	I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
tr	Fin	ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
tr	Fin	I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already !
tr	Fin	My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
tr	Fin	Their customer service was perfect !
tr	Fin	Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted .
tr	Fin	Thank you Roll UP Crepes !
tr	Fin	This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
tr	Fin	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Fin	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
tr	Fin	The best person is the valet .
tr	Fin	Short of that , avoid this place , as a silver Marriott member , this is a disgrace .
tr	Fin	I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
tr	Fin	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
tr	Fin	The fitness center was GREAT !
tr	Fin	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Fin	I absolutely LOVED living there .
tr	Fin	My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia .
tr	Fin	They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .
tr	Fin	Everyone was pleasant and very helpful .
tr	Fin	The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
tr	Fin	The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
tr	Fin	I give this dealer an A +!
tr	Fin	MUST TRY !!!
tr	Fin	THIS PLACE IS THE BEST .
tr	Fin	I HATED SUSHI BEFORE BUT NOW I CANT STOP EATTING IT !!!!!!!
tr	Fin	EVERYTHING IN HERE SEEMS TO AMAZE ME !!!
tr	Fin	THEIR GRILL DISHES ARE OUTTA THIS WORLD AND SUSHI IS JUST FABULOUS !!!!
tr	Fin	I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK .
tr	Fin	THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS .
tr	Fin	JUNO AND OPEN I LOVE YOU GUYS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Fin	The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .
tr	Fin	There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .
tr	Fin	The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
tr	Fin	The atmosphere may not be for everyone .
tr	Fin	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ), but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
tr	Fin	Love the soups .
tr	Fin	Only if it is of the quality of That ' s Amore .
tr	Fin	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Fin	Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there ' s the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
tr	Fin	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I ' m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
tr	Fin	Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used .
tr	Fin	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
tr	Fin	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
tr	Fin	As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
tr	Fin	They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
tr	Fin	Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
tr	Fin	Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was “ excellent ”.
tr	Fin	We love T ' s Cafe !
tr	Fin	T ' s has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
tr	Fin	Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
tr	Fin	If you ' ve been to North County , chances are it ' s in your favorites list already .
tr	Fin	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
tr	Fin	They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
tr	Fin	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Fin	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Fin	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
tr	Fin	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Fin	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
tr	Fin	Looks like there ' s a lot of talent in this place .
tr	Fin	I rated it 5 stars .
tr	Fin	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Fin	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Fin	If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia .
tr	Fin	They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet .
tr	Fin	I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
tr	Fin	If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired !
tr	Fin	I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
tr	Fin	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
tr	Fin	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
tr	Fin	The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
tr	Fin	They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won ' t hurt my score .
tr	Fin	Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
tr	Fin	If you ' re looking to buy a car , definitely give them a call .
tr	Fin	They have a huge inventory .
tr	Fin	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Fin	Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
tr	Fin	Any ER would be the same .
tr	Fin	As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
tr	Fin	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Fin	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
tr	Fin	Dr . Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
tr	Fin	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Fin	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Fin	This school is the worst one i ' ve ever been to .
tr	Fin	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Fin	There ' s holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
tr	Fin	The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they don ' t listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student ' s ).
tr	Fin	The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
tr	Fin	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
tr	Fin	That was 4 years ago .
tr	Fin	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Fin	( I ' ve been through at least 5 places already .)
tr	Fin	If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
tr	Fin	The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
tr	Fin	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Fin	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn ' ta fps .
tr	Fin	He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
tr	Fin	Overall they aren ' t very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
tr	Fin	My friend and I went there for lunch today .
tr	Fin	BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
tr	Fin	We both kept trying to find something we liked .
tr	Fin	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Fin	Liquidweb . com Rocks !!!
tr	Fin	I am not a client of liquidweb . com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
tr	Fin	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Fin	The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
tr	Fin	Each of you should be proud of your massive contributions throughout the year !
tr	Fin	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
tr	Fin	The antipasti were amazing , the wines were mind - blowing , the service couldn ' t have been better .
tr	Fin	I ' ve been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
tr	Fin	They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
tr	Fin	The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
tr	Fin	There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you ' d like .
tr	Fin	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Fin	David is amazing
tr	Fin	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
tr	Fin	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
tr	Fin	He was patient and adapted when everything didn ' t go according to schedule on my wedding day .
tr	Fin	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Fin	He got the pictures back to me quickly .
tr	Fin	My husband just got a bike there as a gift he ' s only had it a month .
tr	Fin	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Fin	But just this week a peddle broke .
tr	Fin	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
tr	Fin	Which was very expensive .
tr	Fin	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Fin	Trek is not so great
tr	Fin	Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
tr	Fin	It ' s pretty ridiculous !
tr	Fin	They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
tr	Fin	Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
tr	Fin	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
tr	Fin	When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy didn ' t know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
tr	Fin	Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
tr	Fin	So what was the point of the appointment !?!
tr	Fin	Internet Department is rude and insulting
tr	Fin	"I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS "" Wow , can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles ."
tr	Fin	Stay away from this dealership !!!
tr	Fin	This place is a Rip - Off
tr	Fin	"I brought a car in to have the "" check engine "" light diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
tr	Fin	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Fin	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Fin	Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ).
tr	Fin	I did the work myself for $ 50 .
tr	Fin	There ' s no excuse for that kind of estimate .
tr	Fin	My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn ' t want to wait in line at Outback .
tr	Fin	What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
tr	Fin	# 1 its immaculately clean .
tr	Fin	# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
tr	Fin	This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
tr	Fin	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
tr	Fin	TRY THIS PLACE - YOU ' LL LOVE IT .
tr	Fin	Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
tr	Fin	I came in and saw Dr . Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
tr	Fin	I have to tell you that I haven ' t had one and don ' t want one .
tr	Fin	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
tr	Fin	I sent a customer of mine to you .
tr	Fin	Dr . Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
tr	Fin	I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before .
tr	Fin	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Fin	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates .
tr	Fin	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
tr	Fin	Hello my name is Vera and I ' m writing a review about my own counseling practice in Bellevue , WA . and in Renton WA .
tr	Fin	I am a licensed mental health counselor and I work with variety of mental health problems .
tr	Fin	I offer compassionate , approachable and personalized counseling services .
tr	Fin	My style is compassionate , nonjudgmental , and caring .
tr	Fin	Please visit my website to learn more about my practice at www . veraakulov . com .
tr	Fin	I am a preferred provider with most insurance companies .
tr	Fin	Schedule your first appointment online !
tr	Fin	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Fin	They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
tr	Fin	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Fin	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
tr	Fin	Among the animals that were available to touch were pony ' s , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
tr	Fin	Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me !!!!
tr	Fin	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
tr	Fin	She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
tr	Fin	I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there isn ' t .
tr	Fin	1 ) Service and manners were nonexistent .
tr	Fin	2 ) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
tr	Fin	4 ) The business is very unorganized .
tr	Fin	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Fin	Exile is the best !!!
tr	Fin	Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
tr	Fin	The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
tr	Fin	The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
tr	Fin	In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
tr	Fin	Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
tr	Fin	Shop local at Exile !!
tr	Fin	Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that doesn ' t impress me .
tr	Fin	The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
tr	Fin	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Fin	The angry lobster was completely over - priced !
tr	Fin	$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
tr	Fin	Alto delivers on all levels .
tr	Fin	From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
tr	Fin	The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
tr	Fin	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Fin	The landlord is not nice nor helpful
tr	Fin	I love the location and the apartment !!
tr	Fin	I ' ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
tr	Fin	The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
tr	Fin	And the exterminator is very nice , also .
tr	Fin	Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that ' s going to be anywhere you go !
tr	Fin	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Fin	I know that ' s ugly ... but she won ' t help you out for anything ... sad story .
tr	Fin	The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
tr	Fin	A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
tr	Fin	She may be the reason for all the change .
tr	Fin	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
tr	Fin	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Fin	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Fin	I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
tr	Fin	There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
tr	Fin	It would have been more than one could bear !
tr	Fin	Kathy and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection .
tr	Fin	I hope to be back !
tr	Fin	"The neon lighting sign still said "" on "" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they ' d be open tomorrow ."
tr	Fin	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
tr	Fin	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
tr	Fin	While there wasn ' t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
tr	Fin	It ' s not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
tr	Fin	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Fin	Restored my faith in Mechaincs .
tr	Fin	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Fin	They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
tr	Fin	The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
tr	Fin	Do yourself a favor , call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again ..
tr	Fin	We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
tr	Fin	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Fin	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I ' m sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
tr	Fin	OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
tr	Fin	The waiters are like no other ...
tr	Fin	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Fin	The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
tr	Fin	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Fin	Holly is truely the best hairstylist !
tr	Fin	I was very pleased with my experience here .
tr	Fin	All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
tr	Fin	I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
tr	Fin	She did a great job !
tr	Fin	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Fin	My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
tr	Fin	I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
tr	Fin	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Fin	The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
tr	Fin	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don ' t let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
tr	Fin	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
tr	Fin	The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
tr	Fin	The owners were entertaining and gracious .
tr	Fin	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals .
tr	Fin	This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
tr	Fin	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
tr	Fin	all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
tr	Fin	The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
tr	Fin	the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
tr	Fin	remember to bring cash since they don ' t take debit or credit .
tr	Fin	hope this helps !!
tr	Fin	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Fin	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Fin	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Fin	I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
tr	Fin	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
tr	Fin	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Fin	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Fin	I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
tr	Fin	First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I don ' t care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ).
tr	Fin	That said , I hated this restaurant .
tr	Fin	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Fin	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
tr	Fin	Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
tr	Fin	I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
tr	Fin	Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle .
tr	Fin	"He told me "" no problem , we will match the offer or do better ."""
tr	Fin	Mr . Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
tr	Fin	Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world .
tr	Fin	I urge all St . Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
tr	Fin	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
tr	Fin	The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
tr	Fin	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
tr	Fin	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
tr	Fin	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Fin	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Fin	Kelly hit the nail on the head .
tr	Fin	""" Dr . Shady "" is a jerk ."
tr	Fin	Dr . Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
tr	Fin	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Fin	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
tr	Fin	I learned more about this doing my own research afterward .
tr	Fin	I think he could ' ve done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
tr	Fin	It ' s pretty combative actually .
tr	Fin	I wish that I hadn ' t done this .
tr	Fin	With these fusions , chiropractric isn ' t as successful , but it still is very helpful .
tr	Fin	Even after my fusions , my back continued to hurt , but now it doesn ' t hurt any more .
tr	Fin	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Fin	I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
tr	Fin	"I regularly request Kim ' s business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!!"""
tr	Fin	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
tr	Fin	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Fin	The service is fast .
tr	Fin	Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
tr	Fin	( it ' s by the door , on the hostess stand )
tr	Fin	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Fin	Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
tr	Fin	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
tr	Fin	I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband ' s funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
tr	Fin	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Fin	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
tr	Fin	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Fin	Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances .
tr	Fin	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Fin	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
tr	Fin	She recommended products but absolutely didn ' t pressure me to buy .
tr	Fin	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Fin	And students get $ 5 off , can ' t argue with that .
tr	Fin	Yeah , this complex is not very good .
tr	Fin	Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
tr	Fin	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
tr	Fin	And non - smokers beware !!!
tr	Fin	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
tr	Fin	If you do not smoke , do not move here .
tr	Fin	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
tr	Fin	I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
tr	Fin	Chicken salad salad is great too .
tr	Fin	Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
tr	Fin	For the quality , the prices ($ 4 -$ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
tr	Fin	The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
tr	Fin	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Fin	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Fin	Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure .
tr	Fin	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Fin	He had a robe that was made back in the ' 60s .
tr	Fin	God was pleased with that one !
tr	Fin	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Fin	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Fin	Stop by at least once or you ' ll go to heck !
tr	Fin	ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
tr	Fin	me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
tr	Fin	i ' ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
tr	Fin	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Fin	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Fin	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Fin	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
tr	Fin	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
tr	Fin	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Fin	I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
tr	Fin	The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
tr	Fin	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
tr	Fin	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren ' t paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
tr	Fin	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
tr	Fin	Tiffany is fabulous !
tr	Fin	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Fin	She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
tr	Fin	Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don ' t have what you need .
tr	Fin	The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
tr	Fin	The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
tr	Fin	The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
tr	Fin	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Fin	We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
tr	Fin	Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
tr	Fin	Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long .
tr	Fin	I recommend La Hacienda
tr	Fin	Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
tr	Fin	Cons : * Server wasn ' t very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
tr	Fin	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
tr	Fin	Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that ' ll change my mind .... and a different server .
tr	Fin	the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
tr	Fin	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
tr	Fin	my experience with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
tr	Fin	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Fin	from start to finish they were top notch .
tr	Fin	This insurance co . Is a joke !!!
tr	Fin	They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
tr	Fin	They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
tr	Fin	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Fin	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Fin	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F %# king Assh @%$ e !!!
tr	Fin	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
tr	Fin	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Fin	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Fin	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
tr	Fin	Love my home at Creekside
tr	Fin	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Fin	The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp . Edwin , are just wonderful .
tr	Fin	They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
tr	Fin	The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe ' s , Whole Foods , and other stores .
tr	Fin	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
tr	Fin	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Fin	I ' m glad I trusted my gut and didn ' t get sucked into doing business with them .
tr	Fin	Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right .
tr	Fin	Don ' t waste your time or money !
tr	Fin	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Fin	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Fin	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Fin	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
tr	Fin	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
tr	Fin	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Fin	After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
tr	Fin	The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
tr	Fin	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Fin	And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
tr	Fin	Dr . Mann killed our pet
tr	Fin	Yea , Dr . Mann ain ' t so great .
tr	Fin	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
tr	Fin	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Fin	If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
tr	Fin	Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ($ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
tr	Fin	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
tr	Fin	AVOID AT ALL COSTS .
tr	Fin	This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
tr	Fin	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Fin	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Fin	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Fin	I used to LOVE this place .
tr	Fin	Lucky I had a spare with me !
tr	Fin	( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you can ' t just go to WalMart .)
tr	Fin	Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
tr	Fin	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
tr	Fin	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
tr	Fin	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
tr	Fin	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Fin	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
tr	Fin	They refused .
tr	Fin	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Fin	College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE !
tr	Fin	Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
tr	Fin	You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate !
tr	Fin	Staff is under educated .
tr	Fin	Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
tr	Fin	Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
tr	Fin	BEWARE !
tr	Fin	This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
tr	Fin	They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
tr	Fin	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Fin	Don ' t go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
tr	Fin	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
tr	Fin	Oh , and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas .
tr	Fin	Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
tr	Fin	Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
tr	Fin	I guess you get what you pay for .
tr	Fin	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
tr	Fin	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Fin	Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
tr	Fin	"When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had "" reserved """
tr	Fin	I was thoroughly impressed !
tr	Fin	I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
tr	Fin	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren ' t the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
tr	Fin	The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company ' s were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
tr	Fin	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Fin	I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
tr	Fin	New training Centre is excellent
tr	Fin	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
tr	Fin	The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
tr	Fin	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Fin	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Fin	The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
tr	Fin	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Fin	I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
tr	Fin	( But this is a certified car from a dealer .)
tr	Fin	So I brought the car back the second day .
tr	Fin	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
tr	Fin	Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
tr	Fin	I walked away .
tr	Fin	So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER .
tr	Fin	STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE .
tr	Fin	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
tr	Fin	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Fin	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Fin	My dental surgeon , Dr . Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
tr	Fin	Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....
tr	Fin	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Fin	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Fin	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Fin	I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
tr	Fin	I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
tr	Fin	I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
tr	Fin	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
tr	Fin	Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
tr	Fin	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
tr	Fin	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Fin	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Fin	It wasn ' t completly impossible !!!!
tr	Fin	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
tr	Fin	The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
tr	Fin	The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
tr	Fin	After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
tr	Fin	This was a less than impressive experience at Trio ' s .
tr	Fin	Run for the hills ... you ' ll be much better off !
tr	Fin	One night was too much .
tr	Fin	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Fin	"I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "" This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton "" and the receptionist then hung up on me ."
tr	Fin	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Fin	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
tr	Fin	Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before .
tr	Fin	Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day ' s training
tr	Fin	On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
tr	Fin	This is by far the BEST B & B that we have ever stayed at !
tr	Fin	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
tr	Fin	The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
tr	Fin	Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
tr	Fin	Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
tr	Fin	A & E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
tr	Fin	I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
tr	Fin	The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A & E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A & E does not ).
tr	Fin	Their quote came in at half the price of A & E for the same work and same part .
tr	Fin	Seems to me like A & E charges way more than necessary !
tr	Fin	Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre - screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
tr	Fin	First let me start out by saying , that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
tr	Fin	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
tr	Fin	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
tr	Fin	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
tr	Fin	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Fin	He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
tr	Fin	If the pedicure lasted 20 mins ., that was a stretch .
tr	Fin	The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
tr	Fin	Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
tr	Fin	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Fin	The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
tr	Fin	I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
tr	Fin	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
tr	Fin	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Fin	( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...)
tr	Fin	The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
tr	Fin	Common room was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . –
tr	Fin	The location is really stellar !
tr	Fin	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Fin	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Fin	We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
tr	Fin	Just Autos Thank you !
tr	Fin	Was fast and easy , Just had our car returned this morning , I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure .
tr	Fin	They certainly know what they are doing .
tr	Fin	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ).
tr	Fin	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Fin	I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
tr	Fin	I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
tr	Fin	All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
tr	Fin	After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , its less dry & smoother !
tr	Fin	If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out !
tr	Fin	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
tr	Fin	I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!!!
tr	Fin	A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
tr	Fin	Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
tr	Fin	All of this started after their oil change .
tr	Fin	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife ' s work and towed it back to fix it .
tr	Fin	Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
tr	Fin	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
tr	Fin	I wonder if they were going down a hill !
tr	Fin	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
tr	Fin	I brought it back with 9000 miles .
tr	Fin	"They "" finished "" the work and told me the car was ready ."
tr	Fin	I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
tr	Fin	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
tr	Fin	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
tr	Fin	Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
tr	Fin	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Fin	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Fin	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Fin	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
tr	Fin	Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
tr	Fin	Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .
tr	Fin	We signed our name in about 6 : 00pm .
tr	Fin	There were 3 names before us .
tr	Fin	The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
tr	Fin	However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
tr	Fin	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Fin	Instructor never showed up !
tr	Fin	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Fin	We waited until 2 : 25 PM and then left .
tr	Fin	There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
tr	Fin	This was our first visit to your studio .
tr	Fin	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Fin	As a yoga studio , I ' m sure you ' re all aware that all actions generate karma …
tr	Fin	I beg to differ .
tr	Fin	This place is marginal at best .
tr	Fin	I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
tr	Fin	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Fin	Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
tr	Fin	These guys were the best .
tr	Fin	They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
tr	Fin	We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
tr	Fin	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Fin	I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80 ' s , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960 ' s .
tr	Fin	They just really know their stuff !
tr	Fin	NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
tr	Fin	I ' m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
tr	Fin	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
tr	Fin	My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
tr	Fin	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
tr	Fin	At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
tr	Fin	I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
tr	Fin	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
tr	Fin	They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
tr	Fin	I never felt pain or discomfort .
tr	Fin	Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
tr	Fin	not only is this place too expensive for what it is , its horrible !
tr	Fin	In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin !), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
tr	Fin	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Fin	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Fin	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
tr	Fin	Texas Roadhouse is WAY better !!
tr	Fin	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
tr	Fin	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Fin	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Fin	Which is so dumb .
tr	Fin	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
tr	Fin	My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
tr	Fin	Then I got a bill for $ 483 . 00 .
tr	Fin	"The doctor ' s office said that payments had been "" reversed ""."
tr	Fin	Blue cross has no record of aa reversal .
tr	Fin	The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC / BS .
tr	Fin	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
tr	Fin	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160 . 00 has come through .
tr	Fin	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Fin	I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
tr	Fin	They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
tr	Fin	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Fin	They did that with no problem .
tr	Fin	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
tr	Fin	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
tr	Fin	They recently surprised me a larger order .
tr	Fin	I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
tr	Fin	Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
tr	Fin	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
tr	Fin	They have a customer for life in us !
tr	Fin	i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
tr	Fin	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
tr	Fin	"Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "" There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck ""."
tr	Fin	Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
tr	Fin	Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
tr	Fin	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Fin	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
tr	Fin	Grimy work you guys do .
tr	Fin	Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks .
tr	Fin	Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
tr	Fin	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell ' s .
tr	Fin	I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
tr	Fin	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Fin	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Fin	I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
tr	Fin	Watch out for your wallet
tr	Fin	Watch out for your wallet !
tr	Fin	This company is overpriced for their services .
tr	Fin	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
tr	Fin	On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
tr	Fin	Believe me .
tr	Fin	This is THE premier university in Virginia .
tr	Fin	It is also the largest .
tr	Fin	With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chilis , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
tr	Fin	VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
tr	Fin	The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
tr	Fin	VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
tr	Fin	VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
tr	Fin	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
tr	Fin	Orr ' s a nightmare !
tr	Fin	DON ' T GO !
tr	Fin	When we complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any problems ), nothing happened !
tr	Fin	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Fin	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Fin	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Fin	To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
tr	Fin	FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
tr	Fin	I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
tr	Fin	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ).
tr	Fin	Now , of course , there ' s a new building , with presumably better facilities .
tr	Fin	For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
tr	Fin	If I remember , students went to Dartmouth , U . Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others .
tr	Fin	Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program .
tr	Fin	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Fin	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
tr	Fin	The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
tr	Fin	There ' s a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
tr	Fin	I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and can ' t stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I ' m in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
tr	Fin	The place is chill and comfortable .
tr	Fin	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Fin	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
tr	Fin	And their breakfast is awesome !!
tr	Fin	Stop in and have a bite you won ' t regret it .
tr	Fin	Not what i expected !
tr	Fin	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Fin	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Fin	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Fin	Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
tr	Fin	On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
tr	Fin	The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
tr	Fin	They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
tr	Fin	The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
tr	Fin	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Fin	Prices are reasonable , ( Kids meals are around 4 . 99 ) and Wednesday ' s they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
tr	Fin	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Fin	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Fin	And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well !)
tr	Fin	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Fin	I am a college student .
tr	Fin	"Before treatment , my food cravings were "" out of control "" which caused me to be stressed out ."
tr	Fin	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Fin	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
tr	Fin	I was amazed .
tr	Fin	I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
tr	Fin	It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
tr	Fin	What I like most about Dr . Liau is that she is very caring .
tr	Fin	She talks to you at each appointment .
tr	Fin	I am SO GLAD to have found Dr . Liau .
tr	Fin	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
tr	Fin	For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
tr	Fin	The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
tr	Fin	The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
tr	Fin	There ' s plenty of parking , and I ' ve never had an issue with audience members who won ' t stop talking or answering their cellphones .
tr	Fin	Best of all , there are no ads !!!!!
tr	Fin	Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
tr	Fin	Thank you , Bowtie !
tr	Fin	My first visit was so fun yesterday .
tr	Fin	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
tr	Fin	The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
tr	Fin	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Fin	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Fin	This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
tr	Fin	By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
tr	Fin	Shop Local !
tr	Fin	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
tr	Fin	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Fin	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
tr	Fin	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Fin	"We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , "" was I gotta have it !"""
tr	Fin	I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier .
tr	Fin	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
tr	Fin	Definitely go see them !
tr	Fin	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Fin	No problem , sounded like it ' s done every day .
tr	Fin	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Fin	Are they serious ?
tr	Fin	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Fin	One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry .
tr	Fin	Yes , there are bigger , but bigger isn ' t necessarily better .
tr	Fin	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Fin	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
tr	Fin	Thank you !
tr	Fin	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
tr	Fin	They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
tr	Fin	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Fin	lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
tr	Fin	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Fin	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
tr	Fin	Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
tr	Fin	Okay , here ' s the scoop .
tr	Fin	I ' ma regular at the HH .
tr	Fin	The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
tr	Fin	I think they ' re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
tr	Fin	In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ).
tr	Fin	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Fin	In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just doesn ' t care / know better .
tr	Fin	You just have to know what you ' re getting into when you go .
tr	Fin	Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ), and don ' t go if you have a limited amount of time .
tr	Fin	Trust The Midas Touch
tr	Fin	I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
tr	Fin	the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
tr	Fin	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
tr	Fin	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
tr	Fin	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical !
tr	Fin	When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
tr	Fin	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Fin	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Fin	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Fin	The other rolls weren ' t at all special , especially given their pricing .
tr	Fin	The bottom line is that the food isn ' t great and is relatively high - priced .
tr	Fin	The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
tr	Fin	It ' s just not worth it .
tr	Fin	Don ' t Expect Sleep or Courtesy
tr	Fin	At 3 : 15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
tr	Fin	These are not household type alarms .
tr	Fin	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Fin	I called the front desk and got no answer .
tr	Fin	After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none , I decided to just pack up and leave .
tr	Fin	The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ?).
tr	Fin	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Fin	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Fin	This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
tr	Fin	Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT go
tr	Fin	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Fin	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
tr	Fin	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Fin	Please do not go there if it ' s professional , friendly , diligent medical services you ' re looking for .
tr	Fin	Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
tr	Fin	When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
tr	Fin	That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
tr	Fin	Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
tr	Fin	You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
tr	Fin	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Fin	Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
tr	Fin	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Fin	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
tr	Fin	Do not live here , you will regret it !
tr	Fin	I figure I would give this company a chance .
tr	Fin	We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
tr	Fin	He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
tr	Fin	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
tr	Fin	WHAT IS THAT ?????
tr	Fin	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
tr	Fin	Please everyone .... take heed and don ' t get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget ...
tr	Fin	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
tr	Fin	"When we walked in , the person behind desk said : "" oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something ."""
tr	Fin	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Fin	Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
tr	Fin	I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
tr	Fin	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Fin	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
tr	Fin	"When I inquired he rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out you ' ll get it back ."""
tr	Fin	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Fin	I also mentioned to the reception person .
tr	Fin	"He responded "" we have problem with ' people '""."
tr	Fin	Imagine a hotel having problems with people .
tr	Fin	I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
tr	Fin	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Fin	We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
tr	Fin	Don ' t stay there .
tr	Fin	I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
tr	Fin	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
tr	Fin	Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
tr	Fin	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
tr	Fin	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
tr	Fin	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn ' t budge .
tr	Fin	Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
tr	Fin	I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
tr	Fin	I emailed 4 times , never a response .
tr	Fin	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet ' s that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
tr	Fin	I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
tr	Fin	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
tr	Fin	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
tr	Fin	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
tr	Fin	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
tr	Fin	I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
tr	Fin	Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
tr	Fin	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Fin	I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
tr	Fin	They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
tr	Fin	So I ordered a slice .
tr	Fin	It tasted like I just flew back home .
tr	Fin	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
tr	Fin	We visited on 7 / 26 / 08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia ' s on Greenfield Ave .
tr	Fin	The food was good , and so was our waitress .
tr	Fin	I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
tr	Fin	The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
tr	Fin	Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
tr	Fin	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Fin	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Fin	There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
tr	Fin	TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
tr	Fin	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
tr	Fin	ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
tr	Fin	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Fin	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
tr	Fin	I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
tr	Fin	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
tr	Fin	I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
tr	Fin	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Fin	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Fin	BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
tr	Fin	their mezza luna ' s are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
tr	Fin	its like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
tr	Fin	it seems like its healthier too , but its prolly not .
tr	Fin	that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting .
tr	Fin	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Fin	their pizza was a little salty for me , but its still good .
tr	Fin	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Fin	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
tr	Fin	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Fin	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Fin	Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
tr	Fin	I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
tr	Fin	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Fin	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
tr	Fin	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
tr	Fin	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
tr	Fin	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Fin	That ' s all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
tr	Fin	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
tr	Fin	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Fin	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
tr	Fin	Thats how they were caught .
tr	Fin	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
tr	Fin	The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
tr	Fin	Nobody lived there .
tr	Fin	My apartment was usually quiet .
tr	Fin	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
tr	Fin	Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
tr	Fin	It sucked having an SUV .
tr	Fin	Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
tr	Fin	Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
tr	Fin	The best there is in service .
tr	Fin	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Fin	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Fin	They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6 : 30 that evening .
tr	Fin	It ' s without a doubt , the best service experience I ' ve ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville ' s price for putting on the other rear tire .
tr	Fin	I hope I can return the favor in the future !
tr	Fin	I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get .
tr	Fin	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Fin	"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" you do not order what you do not know about "" and "" you don ' t know how pizza is made ""."
tr	Fin	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Fin	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
tr	Fin	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn ' t so well - done ( actually , burnt ).
tr	Fin	THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
tr	Fin	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
tr	Fin	I mean , that ' s the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
tr	Fin	Well , this may be an exception .
tr	Fin	And don ' t even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is , and pardon my French , a jerk .
tr	Fin	Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
tr	Fin	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
tr	Fin	Wish this was in Saratoga --
tr	Fin	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
tr	Fin	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Fin	Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
tr	Fin	This chef knows what he is doing .
tr	Fin	Treat yourself and go -- you will go back !
tr	Fin	I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
tr	Fin	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Fin	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Fin	Cannot wait to go gain .
tr	Fin	I think that there pretty good .
tr	Fin	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Fin	But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
tr	Fin	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Fin	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Fin	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
tr	Fin	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
tr	Fin	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
tr	Fin	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
tr	Fin	From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
tr	Fin	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
tr	Fin	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
tr	Fin	Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
tr	Fin	Update : I had to add to my review .
tr	Fin	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
tr	Fin	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
tr	Fin	"Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
tr	Fin	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Fin	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
tr	Fin	I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
tr	Fin	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
tr	Fin	I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
tr	Fin	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Fin	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Fin	The service was excellent and personable .
tr	Fin	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
tr	Fin	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car .
tr	Fin	Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
tr	Fin	That is just unheard of these days !
tr	Fin	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
tr	Fin	He is my mechanic going forward !
tr	Fin	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
tr	Fin	We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
tr	Fin	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Fin	2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
tr	Fin	We are absolutely confident that Stuart ' s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
tr	Fin	I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
tr	Fin	Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
tr	Fin	The intruders slit the screen of the window .
tr	Fin	Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
tr	Fin	My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind !).
tr	Fin	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Fin	Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and didn ' t charge me a dime .
tr	Fin	Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
tr	Fin	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Fin	I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone ' s business !
tr	Fin	Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1 : 00 am !
tr	Fin	There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
tr	Fin	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Fin	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
tr	Fin	"A mid - afternoon "" fire drill "" was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel ."
tr	Fin	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Fin	The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
tr	Fin	Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
tr	Fin	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
tr	Fin	My experience was awful though .
tr	Fin	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Fin	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Fin	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Fin	After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
tr	Fin	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Fin	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which isn ' t true .
tr	Fin	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Fin	The service stunk .
tr	Fin	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone elses .
tr	Fin	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
tr	Fin	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
tr	Fin	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Fin	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
tr	Fin	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Fin	The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
tr	Fin	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
tr	Fin	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Fin	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
tr	Fin	Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
tr	Fin	We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
tr	Fin	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Fin	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Fin	He stood there and told us how he wasn ' t at fault .
tr	Fin	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Fin	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Fin	Do not use this company !
tr	Fin	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
tr	Fin	I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
tr	Fin	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
tr	Fin	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Fin	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Fin	I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
tr	Fin	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Fin	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
tr	Fin	I explained I did not get what I paid for .
tr	Fin	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Fin	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Fin	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
tr	Fin	With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
tr	Fin	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY .
tr	Fin	There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
tr	Fin	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Fin	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Fin	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
tr	Fin	The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
tr	Fin	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Fin	I was appalled .
tr	Fin	The equipment and classes aren ' t good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
tr	Fin	There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
tr	Fin	I feel obligated to share this story .
tr	Fin	Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
tr	Fin	Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
tr	Fin	I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don ' t show up , they ' ll charge you .
tr	Fin	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
tr	Fin	"After he already put product on my hair he said "" I should warn you , I ' m expensive ."""
tr	Fin	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Fin	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Fin	$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
tr	Fin	Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
tr	Fin	I cried the entire way home .
tr	Fin	"He then "" fixed "" it for free but it still looked like crap ."
tr	Fin	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
tr	Fin	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
tr	Fin	That ' s my favorite show of all time .
tr	Fin	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Fin	STAY AWAY !
tr	Fin	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
tr	Fin	However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
tr	Fin	I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
tr	Fin	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Fin	Well , that was strike one .
tr	Fin	However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6 , 000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
tr	Fin	Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
tr	Fin	He said yes .
tr	Fin	In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
tr	Fin	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
tr	Fin	Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
tr	Fin	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
tr	Fin	( They even got me a couch pretty quickly .)
tr	Fin	Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
tr	Fin	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Fin	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
tr	Fin	I waited .
tr	Fin	And waited .
tr	Fin	He never once contacted us .
tr	Fin	He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and didn ' t seem terribly apologetic .
tr	Fin	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Fin	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Fin	Run don ' t walk .
tr	Fin	My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
tr	Fin	If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would .
tr	Fin	On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
tr	Fin	After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces .
tr	Fin	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Fin	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Fin	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Fin	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture .
tr	Fin	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
tr	Fin	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone ' s warehouse .
tr	Fin	Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
tr	Fin	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
tr	Fin	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Fin	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
tr	Fin	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Fin	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Fin	My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !
tr	Fin	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn ' t feel comfortable driving an SUV .
tr	Fin	"Gerry pleasantly said "" since I am already here why don ' t we give it shot ."
tr	Fin	I trust you and believe that you ' ll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
tr	Fin	Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself .
tr	Fin	"Don ' t worry , I ' ll take care of you !"""
tr	Fin	....... the rest was history !
tr	Fin	Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
tr	Fin	"To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !"
tr	Fin	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
tr	Fin	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Fin	We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back .
tr	Fin	They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
tr	Fin	We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
tr	Fin	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
tr	Fin	The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
tr	Fin	They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
tr	Fin	We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
tr	Fin	So that comment is completely false .
tr	Fin	Because we think IT ' S THE BEST !!!
tr	Fin	Dr . Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
tr	Fin	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Fin	I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
tr	Fin	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Fin	"He later said that by 2 months he "" meant at least two months ""."
tr	Fin	Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
tr	Fin	He also never even said he was sorry .
tr	Fin	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
tr	Fin	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Fin	I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
tr	Fin	I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
tr	Fin	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Fin	He said it sarcastically .
tr	Fin	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
tr	Fin	I ' d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they don ' t just take every dog coming in .
tr	Fin	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Fin	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Fin	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Fin	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Fin	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Fin	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe don ' t jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don ' t want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
tr	Fin	I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
tr	Fin	So I say : I ' m at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
tr	Fin	They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
tr	Fin	I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I ' m at the Radison - Warwick .
tr	Fin	And he says : You ' re at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
tr	Fin	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Fin	I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
tr	Fin	He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I ' m in PHILLY .
tr	Fin	Call dominos in your town .
tr	Fin	I SAY LISTEN : I ' m at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
tr	Fin	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Fin	OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
tr	Fin	he says : Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
tr	Fin	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Fin	YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
tr	Fin	Yes , I say .
tr	Fin	17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
tr	Fin	You ' re at 7th .
tr	Fin	I am just south of Walnut .
tr	Fin	She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
tr	Fin	YES , I am west of broad .
tr	Fin	Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
tr	Fin	Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno ' s .
tr	Fin	B & B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
tr	Fin	They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
tr	Fin	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
tr	Fin	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
tr	Fin	We heard nothing .
tr	Fin	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Fin	I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
tr	Fin	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Fin	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Fin	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Fin	So I figure if they don ' t want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I ' ll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
tr	Fin	STAY AWAY !!!
tr	Fin	YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
tr	Fin	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
tr	Fin	Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
tr	Fin	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Fin	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Fin	They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
tr	Fin	The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
tr	Fin	However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ).
tr	Fin	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M , no exceptions .
tr	Fin	Then she was gone .
tr	Fin	We returned after 3PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
tr	Fin	They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
tr	Fin	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Fin	# 4 ) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM .
tr	Fin	I never saw anyone there .
tr	Fin	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
tr	Fin	Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that didn ' t work .
tr	Fin	Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems .
tr	Fin	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
tr	Fin	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
tr	Fin	Quit with the overstatements !
tr	Fin	The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
tr	Fin	It ' s an entirely up and down experience , however .
tr	Fin	Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
tr	Fin	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).
tr	Fin	Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ).
tr	Fin	Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
tr	Fin	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
tr	Fin	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Fin	Dessert was ... hmmm , that ' s interesting , I don ' t even remember dessert .
tr	Fin	I guess that tells you a lot .
tr	Fin	Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
tr	Fin	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
tr	Fin	Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
tr	Fin	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Fin	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
tr	Fin	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Fin	So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
tr	Fin	"They said they were "" unable to tell me until they ordered my dress ""."
tr	Fin	I ' m no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
tr	Fin	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Fin	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Fin	My point : Even if I was wrong , don ' t sit there and argue with the customer .
tr	Fin	"Say something like , "" Huh ."
tr	Fin	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
tr	Fin	Seriously : do not waste your time .
tr	Fin	Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners .
tr	Fin	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
tr	Fin	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn ' t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
tr	Fin	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
tr	Fin	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Fin	Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
tr	Fin	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Fin	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Fin	Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
tr	Fin	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Fin	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Fin	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Fin	So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
tr	Fin	They promised it ' d be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
tr	Fin	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Fin	The employees at this Sear ' s are completely apathetic and there didn ' t seem to be any sort of management that I could see .

tr	Part	Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran .
tr	Part	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Part	Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership .
tr	Part	The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way .

tr	Part	My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non - stop .
tr	Part	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year , which indicates they are the same people .
tr	Part	Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood , and those are trained and armed , so don ' t expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn ' t bomb them , and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen ?
tr	Part	Most people haven ' t gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal is ).
tr	Part	Mosques are calling for donating blood , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah , most of them returned later though .

tr	Part	In the last decade , there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise .
tr	Part	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post - accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
tr	Part	IAEA Report Lessons learned
tr	Part	That too was stopped .
tr	Part	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
tr	Part	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Part	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Part	On the other , restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People ' s Party , who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police .
tr	Part	Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .
tr	Part	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Part	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Part	Of course , the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less - provocative local or international forces , the better .
tr	Part	Web posted at : 3 : 29 p . m . EST ( 2029 GMT )
tr	Part	"Texas Gov . George W . Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those names ."
tr	Part	So , one answer to Bush ' s charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
tr	Part	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti - American terrorism .
tr	Part	Have they , however , actually weakened Israeli security ?
tr	Part	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings .
tr	Part	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Part	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
tr	Part	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Part	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Part	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
tr	Part	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Part	Armed militias , many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience , have proliferated .
tr	Part	These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein ' s regime , but have now organized and armed themselves .
tr	Part	They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
tr	Part	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country ' s petroleum reserves .
tr	Part	That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites .
tr	Part	Israel ' s security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
tr	Part	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Part	The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world , including Iraq .
tr	Part	The promotion by the pro - Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened , not strengthened , Israeli security .
tr	Part	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Part	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Part	According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
tr	Part	Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .
tr	Part	About 1 , 200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .
tr	Part	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Part	""" Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process ,"" TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement ."

tr	Part	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Part	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Part	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Part	While most U . S . secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with , few have been as brazen as Colin Powell .
tr	Part	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Part	That distinction has now gone to the United States .
tr	Part	"This , Pakistan ' s lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told , is the "" minimum "" that the Pakistan army will accept ."
tr	Part	This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu - majority Jammu , a Buddhist - dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley , with the third state given little of taxpayers ' money but substantial autonomy .
tr	Part	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Part	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Part	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Part	"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
tr	Part	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Part	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Part	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
tr	Part	Since then , India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well .
tr	Part	Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell ' s bluff , challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands .
tr	Part	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Part	"Under President Hu Jintao , Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year , making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U . N . Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "" permanent five "" that has not yet done so ."
tr	Part	During this time , F - 102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand .
tr	Part	As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
tr	Part	In all this so - called controversy , has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets ?
tr	Part	Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush ' s service in the Texas Air National Guard .
tr	Part	News coverage of the president ’ s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
tr	Part	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Part	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Part	“ The Vietnam War was winding down , and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs .
tr	Part	In fact , you were helping them solve their problem .”
tr	Part	Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .
tr	Part	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Part	And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush ’ s service , while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry ’ s .
tr	Part	Now , after the Swift boat episode , the spotlight has returned to Bush .
tr	Part	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5 , 000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
tr	Part	Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas .
tr	Part	Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
tr	Part	Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha ' lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
tr	Part	The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
tr	Part	Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
tr	Part	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
tr	Part	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
tr	Part	Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
tr	Part	Al - Gu ' ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government .
tr	Part	Al - Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident .
tr	Part	Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
tr	Part	Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials .
tr	Part	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
tr	Part	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Part	But then , maybe that wouldn ' t have saved him either , because Posada is not Meiring .
tr	Part	Posada can be given up , but Meiring can ' t .
tr	Part	But will Posada be given up ?
tr	Part	The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post - Chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
tr	Part	Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference ; justice would not be served then .
tr	Part	So instead Posada may be held indefinitely , in comfortable custody .
tr	Part	Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
tr	Part	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
tr	Part	Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
tr	Part	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Part	Former Pastor , Deputy Implicated In Church Child Sex Abuse
tr	Part	Austin Aaron Bernard III , 36 , was arrested on a charge of aggravated rape of a child under the age of 13 .
tr	Part	Tangipahoa Parish sheriff ' s deputy Christopher Blair Labat , 24 , was booked Tuesday on one count of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature .
tr	Part	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .
tr	Part	Yesterday evening , the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany ( ARD , Tagesthemen ).
tr	Part	The newly released papers , showing him complicit in the airliner bombing , were mentioned
tr	Part	I was searching for dog food info and found this post .
tr	Part	+ As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Part	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Part	These alleged members of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have been charged with illegal entry .
tr	Part	Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels .
tr	Part	It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea .
tr	Part	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Part	"One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying , "" Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region ."""
tr	Part	As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Part	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Part	This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid - 1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time .
tr	Part	"The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "" other terrorist groups ""."
tr	Part	The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo .
tr	Part	The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now - defunct Asiaweek in 2001 .
tr	Part	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Part	Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket - propelled - grenade launchers , 20 assault rifles , M - 79 grenade launchers and more than 10 , 000 rounds of ammunition .
tr	Part	Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People ' s Front .
tr	Part	The boat was heading toward Cox ' s Bazar in Bangladesh .
tr	Part	A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
tr	Part	Over the past decade , Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness .
tr	Part	A number of extremist groups , under the cover of the Islamist movement , have become active in drug trafficking , gun running and anti - Indian activities .
tr	Part	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Part	As a result , north of the Andaman Islands , Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms .
tr	Part	On South Andaman , the most heavily populated island , is Port Blair , which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago .
tr	Part	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Part	The neighbours are still interfering , but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’ s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it .
tr	Part	All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process , but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan .
tr	Part	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Part	The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non - interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban .
tr	Part	Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf .
tr	Part	Until then he had said Pakistan ’ s options were open .
tr	Part	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Part	Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .
tr	Part	US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .
tr	Part	Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
tr	Part	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Part	Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also .
tr	Part	However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same .
tr	Part	However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates .
tr	Part	The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners .
tr	Part	‘’ Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran .
tr	Part	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Part	The debate that a handful of Texas multi - millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry ' s war record is absurd in every way .
tr	Part	The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
tr	Part	Most of those making the charges have even flip - flopped , contradicting themselves .
tr	Part	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Part	He has never lived in a war zone .
tr	Part	( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn ' t absent yourself from it .
tr	Part	What was Bush doing with his youth ?
tr	Part	He was drinking .
tr	Part	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Part	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Part	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Part	""" All Things Considered ( 8 : 00 PM ET ) - NPR March 30 , 2004 Tuesday"
tr	Part	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Part	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Part	GOODWYN : The candidate Mr . Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business .
tr	Part	Mr . MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ): Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid - evenings .
tr	Part	They ' re going to talk about their kids , they ' re going to talk about football , they ' re going to talk about the weather .
tr	Part	He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him .
tr	Part	It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .
tr	Part	"From Wednesday ' s Mirror the headline , "" Have 200 , 000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists ?"""
tr	Part	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Part	The 99 - tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia .
tr	Part	But the four planeloads of arms have vanished .
tr	Part	Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense .
tr	Part	But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
tr	Part	And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered .
tr	Part	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Part	Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US , British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents .
tr	Part	Meanwhile , a decision ' s been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson .
tr	Part	An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
tr	Part	When victims and witnesses speak up , at least sometimes a child is protected , the truth is exposed , and justice is done .
tr	Part	Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ... the man who reopened the investigations last year , is mysteriously stepping down .
tr	Part	And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation .
tr	Part	Have you sent this to congress yet ?
tr	Part	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
tr	Part	"Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI ' s list of "" Ten Most Wanted Fugitives ,"" a move that caps law enforcement ' s dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ...[ because of ] the impact that the group ' s practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women ."
tr	Part	"Specifically , Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "" spiritual "" marriages for girls and older men ."
tr	Part	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Part	As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo - Nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs has preached racism as well .
tr	Part	""" The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth ,"" Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center ' s "" Intelligence Report ."""
tr	Part	Maybe I ' m missing something here , but how , exactly , does one ' Loose ' 200 , 000 AK47 ' s ?
tr	Part	Funny how some things are squirelled away by well - meaning prosecutors ...
tr	Part	Of course law enforcement has dragged it ' s feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
tr	Part	a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
tr	Part	One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father ' s own brother .
tr	Part	no one was charged for forced marriage , only the beating .
tr	Part	They really are milking the incompetence angle though , aren ' t they ?
tr	Part	Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf , where they lived separated from their parents .
tr	Part	Family visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays .
tr	Part	When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
tr	Part	Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France .
tr	Part	""" Another generation of heavy metal has taken over , and -- sorry -- it ain ' t just about strippers and dope ."
tr	Part	But more and more , as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone , it has gotten to be something weirder .
tr	Part	It ' s become a guardian of morality -- not church morality ; real morality .
tr	Part	"And were the Columbine killers acting out this "" real morality "" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates ."
tr	Part	I ' m firing my editor .
tr	Part	We ' re entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio - political - spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection .
tr	Part	They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home .
tr	Part	The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
tr	Part	They are doing it deliberately .
tr	Part	Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
tr	Part	The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result .
tr	Part	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Part	Are the adherent of ' Crowleyan Thelema ' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect ' energy ?'
tr	Part	I was amazed at the spiel they delivered .
tr	Part	Kindly young men , but utterly programmed and brain - dead .
tr	Part	Has anyone read the letter purportedly from Ahmadinejad to George Bush ?
tr	Part	"Of the metal music farce , Ministry has definately made in - road into ' Loose Change ""-"" Alex Jones "" territory with their new record , Rio Grande Blood ."
tr	Part	They have been accumulating for years , and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever he feels like it .
tr	Part	Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
tr	Part	Tronicus , if you ' re still checking this thread :
tr	Part	The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns , and then 200 , 000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus .
tr	Part	Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi - national corporation , April , 2004 :
tr	Part	I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
tr	Part	My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
tr	Part	I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
tr	Part	And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
tr	Part	The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
tr	Part	It is always shown on television in great detail .
tr	Part	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
tr	Part	The U . S . and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
tr	Part	No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
tr	Part	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
tr	Part	No relative of anyone influential has done it .
tr	Part	Russia is beginning to understand it .
tr	Part	Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .
tr	Part	It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
tr	Part	But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
tr	Part	Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
tr	Part	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
tr	Part	"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam ' s regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration ""."
tr	Part	"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and "" activist "" by the European press ."
tr	Part	He is now being outperformed by his successors .
tr	Part	Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
tr	Part	The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
tr	Part	They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
tr	Part	The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO ' s and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
tr	Part	The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
tr	Part	The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
tr	Part	But it cannot be avoided .
tr	Part	The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
tr	Part	It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
tr	Part	After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
tr	Part	But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .
tr	Part	The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
tr	Part	The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force .
tr	Part	Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
tr	Part	As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
tr	Part	Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
tr	Part	Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
tr	Part	It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
tr	Part	It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
tr	Part	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Part	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Part	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Part	He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
tr	Part	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Part	The CIA reportedly has been quietly building a case that the anthrax mailings were an international plot .
tr	Part	Many people have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the mailings served as a threat and warning .
tr	Part	Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis has explained that while islamists may disagree about whether killing innocents is sanctioned by the laws of jihad , extremists like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used .
tr	Part	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
tr	Part	The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities .
tr	Part	"Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable , has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "" anthrax for Jew sympathizer only ."""
tr	Part	Al Qaeda ' s regional operative , Hambali , who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat , has been captured .
tr	Part	Hambali reportedly is cooperating to some degree .
tr	Part	The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years .
tr	Part	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Part	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Part	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Part	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Part	"A few days before Christmas 2003 , after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks , to include in the US homeland , the threat level was raised to orange or "" high ."""
tr	Part	According to some reports , Zawahiri is thought by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
tr	Part	Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
tr	Part	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Part	The CIA has known of Zawahiri ' s plans to use anthrax for a half decade .
tr	Part	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Part	The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts .
tr	Part	As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino .
tr	Part	The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax .
tr	Part	Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
tr	Part	Various doctors , both foreign and American , are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives , to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan , a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui , PhD , from Karachi .
tr	Part	Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the fugitives .
tr	Part	While it ' s not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought .
tr	Part	According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative ' s house ).
tr	Part	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Part	He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also has received pilot training .
tr	Part	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Part	Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain .
tr	Part	Two top Iraqi scientists , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi ' s anthrax program , according to Dr . David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
tr	Part	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Part	That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals .
tr	Part	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Part	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Part	The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention .
tr	Part	"The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "" domestic "" the word includes a US - based , highly - educated supporter of the militant islamists ."
tr	Part	They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman .
tr	Part	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
tr	Part	Once one had been received , the next ten , mailed on two separate dates , were easily collected .
tr	Part	"Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned , addressed to "" Parole Officer ."""
tr	Part	Abdel Rahman ' s son was captured in Quetta , Pakistan in mid - February 2003 .
tr	Part	Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr . Abdul Qadoos Khan .
tr	Part	Along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden .
tr	Part	The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM ' s nephew .
tr	Part	"According to the controversial "" Feith memo ,"" which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi / Al Qaeda connection , Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent ."
tr	Part	"The "" Federal Eagle "" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue - green ."
tr	Part	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""
tr	Part	The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
tr	Part	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .
tr	Part	The FBI ' s fixation on Hatfill ( at least as rumored by some reporters ) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance .
tr	Part	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
tr	Part	The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
tr	Part	The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory , with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances .
tr	Part	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Part	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him .

tr	Part	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real need for visible support for the “ pro - same - gender - marriage ” side of this issue .
tr	Part	Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration .
tr	Part	Throughout history , tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families , they can kill the spirit of those peoples .
tr	Part	As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life .
tr	Part	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .

tr	Part	Right now , while we ' re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
tr	Part	If I love cats so much , why aren ' t I DOING something ???
tr	Part	Any suggestions would be appreciated .
tr	Part	I ' ve pasted the email for those who haven ' t seen or would like to re - read it .
tr	Part	It ' s also got the website where the song has been uploaded .

tr	Part	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Part	In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan ' s Lake Superior .
tr	Part	The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
tr	Part	If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .
tr	Part	These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .
tr	Part	Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .
tr	Part	"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf ' s relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
tr	Part	Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
tr	Part	This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .
tr	Part	More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver , for instance .
tr	Part	But we ' ve been looking at streamside communities .
tr	Part	A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home .

tr	Part	Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat .
tr	Part	""" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable ."""
tr	Part	According to Parmesan ' s earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .
tr	Part	Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier .
tr	Part	Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .

tr	Part	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""

tr	Part	The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran .
tr	Part	The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi ' ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ).
tr	Part	In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .
tr	Part	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
tr	Part	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Part	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Part	The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf , with some 7 , 000 souls aboard .

tr	Part	The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf .
tr	Part	Currently , the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs .
tr	Part	The vaunted American military has suffered 2 , 210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare .
tr	Part	The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war , a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days .
tr	Part	The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft .
tr	Part	Compounding this is the well - based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf .
tr	Part	China ' s economy is exploding , hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry .
tr	Part	In the last several months , China has inked deals with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas .
tr	Part	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .
tr	Part	Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
tr	Part	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .
tr	Part	American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .
tr	Part	The last three years of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this confidence .
tr	Part	Worse , the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military , justifying the decrease in confidence .
tr	Part	Soldiers with vital training and know - how are refusing to re - enlist .
tr	Part	Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point .
tr	Part	Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .
tr	Part	The question must be put as directly as possible : what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe ?
tr	Part	Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat .
tr	Part	George W . Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front .

tr	Part	what am I doing wrong
tr	Part	I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and doesn ' t get hot enough .

tr	Part	The birth registration was done right in hospital .
tr	Part	My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ....

tr	Part	Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
tr	Part	Have you every traveled before ?
tr	Part	I ' ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
tr	Part	We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
tr	Part	We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it .
tr	Part	you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
tr	Part	in a week ' s time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
tr	Part	he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .
tr	Part	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .

tr	Part	Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
tr	Part	what are you having problems with ?
tr	Part	I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it .. what should i do ?
tr	Part	However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
tr	Part	They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
tr	Part	They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
tr	Part	Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast .
tr	Part	However , I ' ve read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
tr	Part	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Part	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
tr	Part	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Part	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
tr	Part	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
tr	Part	Should have done research before you left .
tr	Part	I ' m just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
tr	Part	I ' ve also considered becoming a teacher , but it ' s not a job I ' m cut out for .

tr	Part	i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
tr	Part	he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
tr	Part	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Part	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
tr	Part	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
tr	Part	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Part	"i have tried "" braining "" both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he doesn ' t care ."
tr	Part	i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .

tr	Part	or were they actually fighting ?
tr	Part	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Part	right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
tr	Part	the territory thing will be solved .
tr	Part	your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
tr	Part	you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
tr	Part	if they hiss , they are not playing .
tr	Part	If they ' re going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as they can ), and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as they can with their paws ) then they ' re playing .
tr	Part	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
tr	Part	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ).
tr	Part	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Part	Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
tr	Part	They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
tr	Part	The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ).
tr	Part	I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
tr	Part	He ' s getting used to his new home , but hasn ' t eatin yet .
tr	Part	Any advice would be greatly appreciated .
tr	Part	UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .

tr	Part	They were chirping and doing their every day business .

tr	Part	The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities .
tr	Part	I have known this guy for a long time , but we ' ve never been good friends or anything .
tr	Part	We were also just talking about my horse ' s crappy feet and he mentioned .
tr	Part	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Part	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Part	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Part	I ' ve known the guy for about 10 years .
tr	Part	I ' ve never done that before though either .
tr	Part	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...

tr	Part	If that is the case then acupuncture isn ' t going to hurt him .
tr	Part	As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we ' ve had to deal with it .
tr	Part	Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
tr	Part	We ' ve had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
tr	Part	We ' ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .

tr	Part	Mixed Tempura ..................... 8 . 25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad .
tr	Part	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
tr	Part	I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
tr	Part	I ' m assuming they are completely out of business since I can ' t find any contact information .
tr	Part	I ' m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
tr	Part	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
tr	Part	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I ' ll definitely order a steak .
tr	Part	Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections .
tr	Part	Boutique stores dealing in children ' s clothing / gifts are often outrageously priced ( who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie ?)

tr	Part	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
tr	Part	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Part	I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
tr	Part	I ' ve never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
tr	Part	Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives !
tr	Part	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Part	As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
tr	Part	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
tr	Part	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
tr	Part	Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we ' d try it .
tr	Part	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
tr	Part	You have been awarded the converted Hino Dealer of the Year !
tr	Part	Well done to Anthony and the team !
tr	Part	Well done to Brendan and the team !
tr	Part	Well done to Jason and the team !
tr	Part	Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I ' ve ever eaten ( and I ' ve eaten a lot ).
tr	Part	I ' ve dined at lots of high - end restaurants and I ' ve never before felt my money was so well spent .
tr	Part	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Part	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Part	Worst Service I ' ve Ever Experienced
tr	Part	( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
tr	Part	I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
tr	Part	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
tr	Part	The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
tr	Part	"grey shirt "" mark "" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing ....."
tr	Part	They have restored my faith in Mechanics .
tr	Part	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
tr	Part	You will not be disappointed !!!!!!
tr	Part	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Part	I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
tr	Part	So huge in fact , that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references , and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria .
tr	Part	Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
tr	Part	The finest Christmas Trees i ' ve ever seen .
tr	Part	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Part	I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
tr	Part	You have just lost mine .
tr	Part	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Part	I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
tr	Part	Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE .
tr	Part	I have had my back fused in 2 places .
tr	Part	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
tr	Part	My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
tr	Part	I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
tr	Part	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Part	We should have left then .
tr	Part	We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
tr	Part	Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
tr	Part	I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
tr	Part	The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
tr	Part	My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
tr	Part	In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
tr	Part	in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
tr	Part	Gone downhill since change in ownership
tr	Part	But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
tr	Part	I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them , they lost my car key .
tr	Part	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
tr	Part	We were told that we couldn ' t today because they were closing soon .
tr	Part	Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
tr	Part	Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont .
tr	Part	So don ' t get taken in , keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here .
tr	Part	On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
tr	Part	I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
tr	Part	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
tr	Part	We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
tr	Part	Best money I ' ve spent on remodeling ever .
tr	Part	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
tr	Part	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
tr	Part	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
tr	Part	We were also served salad and soda .
tr	Part	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Part	I am definitely going back
tr	Part	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Part	How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
tr	Part	How fast your support queries get answered ?
tr	Part	We could not have been more welcomed , more comfortable or more well fed .
tr	Part	None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
tr	Part	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Part	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9 : 30am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
tr	Part	Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we didn ' t mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
tr	Part	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever its like driving a new car .
tr	Part	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Part	This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “ no reservation , sign your name here ”.
tr	Part	"January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday ' s 2 PM class "" Beginning Yoga with Brittany ."""
tr	Part	Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained .
tr	Part	The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
tr	Part	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
tr	Part	We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
tr	Part	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Part	The craziest part is that they aren ' t even based locally at the city I ' m in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
tr	Part	I ' ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
tr	Part	Be warned - they ' ll ltake you for everything they can .
tr	Part	The U of R is also recommended , too !
tr	Part	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who ' d arrived around 1 : 00 am and were drinking at the springs .
tr	Part	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Part	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Part	highly recommended .
tr	Part	I ' ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance )...
tr	Part	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
tr	Part	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
tr	Part	Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
tr	Part	Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
tr	Part	Bowtie has filled that role nicely .
tr	Part	The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
tr	Part	I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
tr	Part	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
tr	Part	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
tr	Part	Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
tr	Part	I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
tr	Part	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Part	The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
tr	Part	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Part	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Part	We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
tr	Part	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Part	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Part	He was referred to me by a friend , who didn ' t have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
tr	Part	I will not be visiting Mama Mia ' s again .
tr	Part	IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL .
tr	Part	** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , I have had food delivered before .
tr	Part	I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
tr	Part	Myself and my fiance ' s identity was stolen from the office staff .
tr	Part	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
tr	Part	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Part	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Part	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Part	I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call .
tr	Part	Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy .
tr	Part	I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
tr	Part	"If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are "" ok ,"" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
tr	Part	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
tr	Part	Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
tr	Part	I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
tr	Part	We were greeted again and sat promptly .
tr	Part	Well Done !
tr	Part	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
tr	Part	How has it gone so far ?
tr	Part	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Part	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Part	The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that ' s not why I ' m writing my review .
tr	Part	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
tr	Part	Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
tr	Part	A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
tr	Part	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Part	The Worst Chinese I ' ve Ever Had
tr	Part	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order .
tr	Part	One of the worst experiences I ' ve ever had with a auto repair shop .
tr	Part	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
tr	Part	Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away .
tr	Part	What was I supposed to do , say I can ' t afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair .
tr	Part	I wasn ' t going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
tr	Part	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Part	I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
tr	Part	I ' ve had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
tr	Part	I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
tr	Part	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Part	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
tr	Part	And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
tr	Part	Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
tr	Part	"PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "" all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and I will tell you that I don ' t know these people except from eating at their restaurant ."
tr	Part	A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
tr	Part	I ' ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
tr	Part	But I ' ve done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I don ' t work here ), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
tr	Part	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Part	No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so isn ' t it reasonable to think they might know what they ' re doing ?
tr	Part	Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we don ' t go past broad ?
tr	Part	"Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year !""."
tr	Part	I WAS calling about one board !!
tr	Part	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Part	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
tr	Part	If you go later , it ' s all cleaned up .
tr	Part	All these rules are posted in the rooms .)
tr	Part	That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
tr	Part	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Part	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Part	Whatever type of operation they are running , I ' m not interested and if you ' re smart , you won ' t be either .
tr	Part	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn ' t possible .
tr	Part	I would not have gone back , but I couldn ' t find the particular tire they ' d used in stock anywhere else .
tr	Part	Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
tr	Part	"A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that "" I "" left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car )."
tr	Part	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Part	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
tr	Inf	Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don ' t find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful .
tr	Inf	If someone committed a crime against humanity , prosecute the person .
tr	Inf	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Inf	Baghdadis don ' t venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more , you never know where you might get stuck .
tr	Inf	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Inf	Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story .
tr	Inf	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Inf	Being well - informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
tr	Inf	Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray ?
tr	Inf	Don ' t have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks -- there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl .......
tr	Inf	Even a little time spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc . can add years to their lives .
tr	Inf	The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming , and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have .
tr	Inf	What do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
tr	Inf	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Inf	If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts .
tr	Inf	They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .
tr	Inf	Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .
tr	Inf	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Inf	On the other hand , the US should strong - arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue .
tr	Inf	2 ) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government .
tr	Inf	This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks .
tr	Inf	It should continue to be defanged .
tr	Inf	3 ) Make Iraq another Afghanistan , using the Republican Right ' s own tactics against them .
tr	Inf	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Inf	He could not name the others .
tr	Inf	""" Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan ?"""
tr	Inf	I can ' t tell you how ominous I found Bush ' s performance in that interview .
tr	Inf	"I still remember him stuttering about "" the General ,"" unable to remember Musharraf ' s name ."
tr	Inf	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Inf	He couldn ' t tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
tr	Inf	Indeed , given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US , one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does .
tr	Inf	I don ' t see Bush doing any of this .
tr	Inf	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel ' s security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Inf	He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
tr	Inf	""" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one ."
tr	Inf	The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession .
tr	Inf	Simultaneously , New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan .
tr	Inf	With luck , the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist , education and services haven within India .
tr	Inf	"That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "" foreigner - led "" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism , has not struck the conferees , among whom have been several Indian "" scholars "" and "" analysts "" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna ."
tr	Inf	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Inf	They don ' t let just anybody do it .
tr	Inf	For example , did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry ?
tr	Inf	What do you really know about George W . Bush ’ s time in the Air National Guard ?
tr	Inf	That he didn ’ t show up for duty in Alabama ?
tr	Inf	Did you know that ?
tr	Inf	We should know as much as we can .
tr	Inf	And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well .
tr	Inf	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Inf	The only hope now is that , following the elections , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties .
tr	Inf	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba ' athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
tr	Inf	The Shia cannot live without the Sunnis , and vice versa .
tr	Inf	Remember Luis Posada Carriles ?
tr	Inf	I can ' t imagine they wanted to do this .
tr	Inf	Posada ' s crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who don ' t know their history .
tr	Inf	And to those who don ' t even know their crimes , not even that .
tr	Inf	So his name will remain unspoken .
tr	Inf	If I was Rummy I ' d send Posada to Iraq to blow things up there .
tr	Inf	I don ' t know how others feel , but I ' m definitely looking into immigration to Canada as an option .

tr	Inf	How Would You Like To Know How YOU Can Live In A Beautiful NEW House That Is Custom - Designed To YOUR Specifications ......... And At NO COST To You ?
tr	Inf	You CAN Do It .
tr	Inf	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
tr	Inf	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
tr	Inf	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Inf	In fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti - India outfits , such as the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these networks and weaken India ' s eastern flank .
tr	Inf	That too may change .
tr	Inf	With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections , the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .
tr	Inf	Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .
tr	Inf	Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan ’ s neighbours is over , but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours ’ interference .
tr	Inf	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Inf	Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy .
tr	Inf	He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
tr	Inf	On the phone , you could hear his accent .
tr	Inf	Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural counties didn ' t have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
tr	Inf	Ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5 : 30 or 6 : 00 in the evening .
tr	Inf	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George certainly didn ' t seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there .
tr	Inf	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Inf	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George didn ' t have any interest at all in talking about the military .
tr	Inf	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Inf	Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- didn ' t like that story .
tr	Inf	"And he would always laugh about that . """
tr	Inf	Again , decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
tr	Inf	Afraid I don ' t have time today to discuss these , but some stories need attention :
tr	Inf	"But then , even to talk of an "" administration "" may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative government means in the United States these days , and how much of "" national security "" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns ."
tr	Inf	"Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "" lost "" in Iraq , planeloads of arms don ' t just "" vanish ""; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout ' s untouchable stature ."
tr	Inf	talk about law enforcement not having the will ...
tr	Inf	No need to worry .
tr	Inf	Personally I don ' t give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
tr	Inf	We wouldn ' t want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us .
tr	Inf	Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate .
tr	Inf	Christ , you ' d think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots .
tr	Inf	Which may explain the pattern to their stories : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .
tr	Inf	And we ' ll get around to that .
tr	Inf	"Praise be : Given the void in responsible behavior among governments , police , educational establishments and religions , the task of guiding our youth down the path of righteousness has fallen to ... Satan """
tr	Inf	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter - cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but doesn ' t apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
tr	Inf	The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion .
tr	Inf	I wouldn ' t wonder too hard .
tr	Inf	No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
tr	Inf	""" No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked ."
tr	Inf	Do you really think GWB , and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth ?
tr	Inf	So why even credit their claims ?
tr	Inf	Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place ?
tr	Inf	Does the distinction actually exist ?
tr	Inf	Why don ' t you state it ?
tr	Inf	( Don ' t wish to use Wikipedia again , it ' s just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information .)
tr	Inf	Not 200 , 000 guns - the numbers dont work :
tr	Inf	Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers .
tr	Inf	I don ' t know if this has been verified .
tr	Inf	But who would do a thing like that .... hey wait a minute
tr	Inf	== Why did Bush revoke Executive Order 13011 today ?
tr	Inf	I can ' t believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI .
tr	Inf	In my opinion , people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems .
tr	Inf	The ' high weirdness ' and more hardcore political ' factions ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
tr	Inf	Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well ?
tr	Inf	I just get hung up on ' Christians ', as they ' re the dominant form where I come from .
tr	Inf	I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
tr	Inf	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
tr	Inf	Sub - cultures ( as the lable implies ) do not develope in a vacuum .
tr	Inf	You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
tr	Inf	However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
tr	Inf	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
tr	Inf	Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
tr	Inf	Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
tr	Inf	Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60 ' s because of Israel .
tr	Inf	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Inf	Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
tr	Inf	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Inf	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Inf	We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
tr	Inf	But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
tr	Inf	Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
tr	Inf	How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
tr	Inf	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
tr	Inf	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Inf	Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .
tr	Inf	"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
tr	Inf	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
tr	Inf	"You must go after the head of the "" Family ""."
tr	Inf	If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
tr	Inf	In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
tr	Inf	But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
tr	Inf	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Inf	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
tr	Inf	You will not believe your own eyes .
tr	Inf	But words also work in other ways , more subtle .
tr	Inf	You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
tr	Inf	Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
tr	Inf	Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
tr	Inf	Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
tr	Inf	"Does free speech protect you when you shout "" fire "" in a crowded theater ?"
tr	Inf	Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?
tr	Inf	Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
tr	Inf	Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
tr	Inf	Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
tr	Inf	Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
tr	Inf	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Inf	Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
tr	Inf	Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
tr	Inf	Do you shoot an arch - murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
tr	Inf	What do you do ?
tr	Inf	Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
tr	Inf	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Inf	International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
tr	Inf	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Inf	What can we do about it ?
tr	Inf	In the short run , only fight and win .
tr	Inf	In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
tr	Inf	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Inf	"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" supplies "" from expanding the tumor ."
tr	Inf	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Inf	I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre - war argument , but I can look at the post - war map of Western Asia .
tr	Inf	I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
tr	Inf	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Inf	No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
tr	Inf	But it really does not matter .
tr	Inf	The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
tr	Inf	In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
tr	Inf	It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
tr	Inf	"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."""
tr	Inf	Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9 / 11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
tr	Inf	Sufaat , according to both KSM and Hambali , did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used .
tr	Inf	That would require someone who had access to the strain .
tr	Inf	But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri ' s decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter .
tr	Inf	"In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop ( from 1995 ) that was signed "" Khalid Sheik Bojinka ""?"
tr	Inf	Significantly , the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ), upon being contacted , does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft . Detrick .
tr	Inf	Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed ' s computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons .
tr	Inf	Although the details of the documents on Mohammed ' s computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings .
tr	Inf	If mistaken , how did those reports first come about ?
tr	Inf	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Inf	They would know .
tr	Inf	The present evidence relating to Atta ' s alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq .
tr	Inf	Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam ' s son .
tr	Inf	The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message .
tr	Inf	Sound familiar ?
tr	Inf	( The position does not exist ).
tr	Inf	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Inf	At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained , recruits would wear green uniforms , except for Friday when they were washed .
tr	Inf	Zawahiri ' s mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes .
tr	Inf	What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet ?
tr	Inf	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
tr	Inf	A search of Dr . Ken Berry ' s residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory .
tr	Inf	He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc .) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
tr	Inf	I will send the specifics per Andre later today .
tr	Inf	Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress , Risk 2001 Australia , which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001 .
tr	Inf	Will you drive on that day ?
tr	Inf	Anne , Mike will call you regarding Sarah .
tr	Inf	If the latter is the case , we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33 - 66K ).
tr	Inf	I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don ' t have access to now .
tr	Inf	If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds , or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S @ P , I ' d listen .
tr	Inf	We ' ll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options .
tr	Inf	At some point , I ' d like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close ?
tr	Inf	I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options .
tr	Inf	Would dinner Thursday work instead .
tr	Inf	Wednesday doesn ' t work for me .
tr	Inf	I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1 - 2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything .
tr	Inf	What do you guys think .
tr	Inf	I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday .
tr	Inf	Wednesday doesn ' t work for me .

tr	Inf	What do you guys think .
tr	Inf	Did you happen to sign your employment agreement ?
tr	Inf	I would like to get this done ASAP .
tr	Inf	Business Case : If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $ 10 , 000 increase ( approximately 25 %) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
tr	Inf	It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted .
tr	Inf	Secondly , he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg . Paul Thomas , Jason Choate , Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai .
tr	Inf	This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U . S . electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC ' s RTO initiatives .
tr	Inf	The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them .
tr	Inf	It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion .
tr	Inf	It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing , including market - based pricing alternatives to FERC ' s traditional pricing methods .
tr	Inf	The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system .
tr	Inf	How do you feel about taking on another company ?
tr	Inf	Do you concur ?
tr	Inf	Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization ?
tr	Inf	If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
tr	Inf	Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax .

tr	Inf	Do you concur ?
tr	Inf	Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization ?
tr	Inf	If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
tr	Inf	My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like .
tr	Inf	For example , I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper .
tr	Inf	I don ' t know that he did any )
tr	Inf	We ' ll find time when things settle down .
tr	Inf	I may have to postpone again , I ' ll let you know later this morning .
tr	Inf	I may have to postpone again , I ' ll let you know later this morning .
tr	Inf	I will put this on our calendars .
tr	Inf	Too bad you won ' t make the Compaq thing , but maybe next year .
tr	Inf	I can recommend some good restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday .
tr	Inf	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
tr	Inf	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what ' s in the draft ?
tr	Inf	Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract , or several ?
tr	Inf	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .

tr	Inf	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
tr	Inf	In order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 .
tr	Inf	In my opinion , we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached .
tr	Inf	I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI .
tr	Inf	Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
tr	Inf	We don ' t want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project .
tr	Inf	You will have to wait and see :-)
tr	Inf	I won ' t forget about the $.
tr	Inf	Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that ?
tr	Inf	Just a reminder to send me a currency report .
tr	Inf	You should reply ASAP .
tr	Inf	I didn ' t get a chance to talk to Paul today .
tr	Inf	Will you please run a June NX3 / NX1 for our book .
tr	Inf	Hopefully he didn ' t spel anyting incorrectly .
tr	Inf	I ' ll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not .
tr	Inf	Should I send the resume to Dawn or you directly ?
tr	Inf	We should try to have a conference call with the west desk to discuss as soon as we can .
tr	Inf	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation ( big dance that she and I are committed to help with ), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion .
tr	Inf	So the last weekend in January would work well ( and I will need a rest from formal affairs !).
tr	Inf	Does that work for you ?
tr	Inf	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
tr	Inf	How does late January sound to you .
tr	Inf	Should we set a date now ?
tr	Inf	With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .
tr	Inf	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations .
tr	Inf	I don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .
tr	Inf	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards .
tr	Inf	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .
tr	Inf	Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
tr	Inf	In some respects I don ' t think the first panel could have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for different reasons ).
tr	Inf	Does she have any interest in meeting one - on - one or is she just looking for a public hanging ?
tr	Inf	Given the short notice , we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday , but will let the good Senator know that , in general , we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody .
tr	Inf	Can we get some help on the IBM issues ?
tr	Inf	IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains .
tr	Inf	No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
tr	Inf	HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous .
tr	Inf	Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e - mail ).
tr	Inf	Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we can ' t and where they are ?
tr	Inf	Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning BackWeb before we proceed .
tr	Inf	As you can see from the Design Document , they are pretty significant .

tr	Inf	I can ' t give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password .
tr	Inf	P . S . By the way , did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL ?
tr	Inf	what do you think ?
tr	Inf	We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz .
tr	Inf	We would still keep the 20 , 000 , 000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement .
tr	Inf	We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line , putting us over the limit , without me knowing ...
tr	Inf	We could change the language of the POA to this ...
tr	Inf	we will not go over Global ' s piece of the Cargill line ...

tr	Inf	I can meet around 10 : 00 .
tr	Inf	That way , we can get it to them in time for weekend review .
tr	Inf	Does that work ?

tr	Inf	Why didn ' t Craig show Ma his appartment ?
tr	Inf	What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben ( he was almost shocked )?
tr	Inf	Hey , Mr . Computer , you can ' t log an email in to your sister ?!
tr	Inf	You can take my assistant Taffy Milligan off these emails again .
tr	Inf	If so , I ' ll get it signed by Craig Breslau today , then bring it to you for countersignature .
tr	Inf	No , it does not mean that .
tr	Inf	"Adding all the Enron "" Specified Entities "" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement ."
tr	Inf	Our concern is that we don ' t want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component .
tr	Inf	If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
tr	Inf	can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of .
tr	Inf	Hopefully , if we ' re still dating come December , you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit .
tr	Inf	Needless to say I am very excited .
tr	Inf	Would you come with your parents or separately ?
tr	Inf	We ' ll do whatever you want want if you still are coming !
tr	Inf	Do You Yahoo !?
tr	Inf	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn ' t spell her name right in the email - I mean it ' s such a common spelling .
tr	Inf	I ' ll talk to you later .
tr	Inf	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
tr	Inf	At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things .
tr	Inf	I ' ll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
tr	Inf	I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ).
tr	Inf	"EnronOnline will assist users , upon request , in arranging for the connection of "" T1 "" lines or other means of direct access to EnronOnline , as an alternative to internet access ."
tr	Inf	Direct access connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access .
tr	Inf	The least we can do is pass this news along .
tr	Inf	It doesn ' t sound like he can receive visitors yet .
tr	Inf	Do you know the address to send cards ??
tr	Inf	Do you know if Bobby can see visitors ??
tr	Inf	Some of the folks here would like to know .
tr	Inf	He cannot accept calls , visits or flowers at this time , since he is in the emergency room .?
tr	Inf	Can you offer comments / concerns / guidelines ?
tr	Inf	Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires ?
tr	Inf	We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others .
tr	Inf	We would like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually .
tr	Inf	I don ' t know where this stands officially ( I haven ' t heard any developments since Amsterdam ) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want .
tr	Inf	We should include ISDA energy definitions , CFTC matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in North America .
tr	Inf	I might also add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power trading form .
tr	Inf	Wed . Sept . 20 - Leave Houston around 6 : 00 pm
tr	Inf	Thur . Sept . 21 - Arrv . London early a . m ., transfer to flight to Nice

tr	Inf	Tues . Oct . 3 - Fly London to Houston ( lv . around noon , arrv . around 4 : 30pm )
tr	Inf	Unfortunately , I can ' t forward your message to him directly ( there seems to be a problem with the attachment ).
tr	Inf	"If you still have it , can you send it to him at "" Mark EI . London Taylor ""?"
tr	Inf	I will take care of it .
tr	Inf	Could you please send an executable version of the contract to Fred , David , John and me tomorrow ?
tr	Inf	If they ' re OK with it , we ' d like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections .
tr	Inf	If these amendmnets are agreeable to you can you please print and arrange for execution .
tr	Inf	Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size , and that Mom is doing well .
tr	Inf	These three little ones don ' t realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad , but I ' m sure they ' ll find out soon .
tr	Inf	This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday , 6th July , to our triplets :
tr	Inf	Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp . likes their resolutions drafted than we are .
tr	Inf	Will you pass along to the appropriate person ?
tr	Inf	After you have had the chance to review the attached , please send me a marked - up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there .
tr	Inf	Did you get a chance to find those GTC ' s for ENA that you can forward this way ?
tr	Inf	Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end )?
tr	Inf	If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
tr	Inf	I ' ll keep you posted .
tr	Inf	I ' ll get back to you as soon as I have more info ( hopefully later today )
tr	Inf	I don ' t want to wait till month end , let ' s adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order , lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts .

tr	Inf	I ' ll get back to you as soon as I have more info ( hopefully later today )
tr	Inf	unable to attend at that time due to a prior appointment , I can meet with you individually later some time
tr	Inf	I would like to informally get together with you on Wednesday , July 18 at 11 : 45 am - 1 : 00 pm ( max ) to talk about your recruiting experience with Enron Canada .
tr	Inf	We ' ll hook you guys in by videoconference .
tr	Inf	This meeting should not take more than one hour .
tr	Inf	Also , would those of you who have not responded to me via email confirming your acceptance of the terms upon which our four companies have agreed to assume cost responsibility for the TCA work on this .
tr	Inf	A formal invitation will follow to those who respond .
tr	Inf	I ' ll believe it when I see it .
tr	Inf	Also , can you confirm the correct names , email addresses , titles for those new folks on Friday ' s call : Robbie Rossi , Michelle , Melissa Lloyd ?
tr	Inf	Yes , I would like to participate .
tr	Inf	Everyone will dial the toll free number 1 - 877 - 331 - 6867 .
tr	Inf	The call will terminate once everyone has hung up .
tr	Inf	I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement process .?
tr	Inf	While we should be proud of our accomplishment , we now must turn to the task of getting our testimony ready by May 5 deadline .?
tr	Inf	Goal is to ( politely ?) refute Loretta Lynch ' s and Carl Woods ' continued assertions that 1 ) California ' s move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2 ) the solution is to turn back the clock to command - and - control regulation .
tr	Inf	We ' ll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S . D . last week .
tr	Inf	Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
tr	Inf	Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ), I ' d say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
tr	Inf	If you could respond to me on this request , thanks
tr	Inf	Can one of you give me a quick call to discuss .
tr	Inf	Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking ?
tr	Inf	This would have to be determined on a case by case basis .
tr	Inf	Yes , we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and / or Commodity Contracts and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act ( Alberta ), Securities Act ( British Columbia ) and Securities Act ( Ontario ).
tr	Inf	"With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with , do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "" eligible swap participant "" equivalant rules ?"
tr	Inf	Why does it always have to be my deals ...?!!!
tr	Inf	Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation ...
tr	Inf	BC Gas won ' t sign the confirms with the rep in , and this has caused much difficulties .
tr	Inf	Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me .
tr	Inf	When you have a minute , I ' ll give me a call and I ' ll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel .
tr	Inf	Carol , will you handle this or Mark ?
tr	Inf	could you take a look at this and give me an update .
tr	Inf	Confirmation Desk : you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now .
tr	Inf	I ' ll need to talk to you about his Monday .
tr	Inf	The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account
tr	Inf	I will discuss with AA the following
tr	Inf	The signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate ' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
tr	Inf	We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .
tr	Inf	However , this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p & l values with traders .
tr	Inf	The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
tr	Inf	The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
tr	Inf	I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application .
tr	Inf	I would like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you .
tr	Inf	If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .
tr	Inf	I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program .
tr	Inf	I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program .
tr	Inf	Also , I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an Energy - Finance Private Equity Fund at UT .
tr	Inf	Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC ' s goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
tr	Inf	"We will fight with them about who owes the $ 200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "" assist "" us in managing the cost ."
tr	Inf	Do we have someone who is watching this out there ?
tr	Inf	Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management .
tr	Inf	My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC ' s online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC ' s peak load periods .
tr	Inf	One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I ' ve listed .
tr	Inf	Lou , do we have any sort of policy on requests like this ?
tr	Inf	Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her offices - on 47 and 41 .
tr	Inf	Lou , do we have any sort of policy on requests like this ?
tr	Inf	Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her offices - on 47 and 41 .
tr	Inf	As it stands , MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers .
tr	Inf	Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he ' s on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation .
tr	Inf	Can ' t catch you this time but 14721 keep me posted on your next trip .
tr	Inf	To reserve one of these rooms , you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group .
tr	Inf	If so , I will handle it .
tr	Inf	Do you want me to send the invoices to you ?
tr	Inf	Can we visit about what went on with Ursula at the PRC meeting when you catch up ?
tr	Inf	Can we have a meeting this week ( maybe Thursday at 3 : 30 ) to discuss this ?
tr	Inf	We do need a formal plan .
tr	Inf	Can we find another time that works for us to meet ?
tr	Inf	I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am .
tr	Inf	You may want to discuss with Becky .
tr	Inf	This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting .
tr	Inf	In the meantime , could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues ?
tr	Inf	What do I need to do ?
tr	Inf	The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel .
tr	Inf	I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email .
tr	Inf	We would like to pursue an offer to Rick Fehl prior to the next Executive Committee meeting on May 7 , 2001 .
tr	Inf	You will find attached the recommendation letter and his resume .
tr	Inf	This is to advise you that we have available , for your business or personal use , Stan ' s four ( 4 ) WNBA Comets tickets .
tr	Inf	Please note that date and time are subject to change ; please check local listings .
tr	Inf	It will give us some weekend reading !
tr	Inf	Stan will attend in person .
tr	Inf	Yes , I will attend in person _______
tr	Inf	No , I will not attend _______
tr	Inf	With divisions , EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below .
tr	Inf	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."
tr	Inf	Enron will guarantee delivery by the 20th of each scheduled Dispatch Period and accept supply to the 15th of each scheduled Dispatch Period .
tr	Inf	"Right "" mouse "" click on "" properties "" to view product set - up"
tr	Inf	We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty .
tr	Inf	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .
tr	Inf	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
tr	Inf	I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and , if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure , please let me know .
tr	Inf	Also , the Global SAP team ( Cheryl Johnson ) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name .
tr	Inf	GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously .
tr	Inf	With divisions , EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below .
tr	Inf	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."
tr	Inf	Any chance we can get together for dinner Saturday eve .?
tr	Inf	Can you cover for me today ?
tr	Inf	Do we have 2 sessions today ?
tr	Inf	If so , you may want to split and cover .
tr	Inf	I will take you next one in August .
tr	Inf	Call - in #: 800 / 711 - 8000
tr	Inf	What do you think ?
tr	Inf	After that , what do we do ?
tr	Inf	Do you also have a SSD we can use ?
tr	Inf	Should there be a ( groan ) meeting on this ?
tr	Inf	Can you please help with this one ?
tr	Inf	I ' d like to work with you on a response to this customer .
tr	Inf	To Whom It May Concern :
tr	Inf	Since Enron ' s employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers ( P number ) and an HR number , could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers ?
tr	Inf	I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron , especially when some databases are from third - parties ( out - sourcing ).
tr	Inf	We could use our badge number there instead of our SS .
tr	Inf	A reminder that the HR Associate Points Meeting will take place as below :
tr	Inf	Upon receipt , I shall forward to each of you a copy of the reviews for your respective associate .
tr	Inf	Those who are not assigned an associate may also allocate points ( a max of 150 ) at the meeting based on contribution to your areas for the first review period .
tr	Inf	I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher .
tr	Inf	Could you please ask Shanna to take this situation to Sharon tomorrow ?
tr	Inf	HBS will shadow Enron and a number of other companies over the next five years to assess how we react to market changes and to see how we morph during this time period .
tr	Inf	And then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite to lay out the plan .
tr	Inf	We will need local legal counsel to assist us in this regard .
tr	Inf	I would like both Lynn and I to participate .
tr	Inf	Can you tell us where .
tr	Inf	, Do you want us to come over to the Enron b in your call .
tr	Inf	If something happens that I ' m not able to participate I ' ll let you know .
tr	Inf	As a result of our luncheon with the confirm desk yesterday , could someone develop a comprehensive list identifying all omnibus attachments ?
tr	Inf	Can we reschedule the phone call for 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) on Friday , Sept . 17 ?
tr	Inf	I will initiate the call .
tr	Inf	One thing that doesn ' t show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue .
tr	Inf	Becky will bring you the hard copy version .
tr	Inf	I ' ll call you shortly .
tr	Inf	They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes .
tr	Inf	To what do I owe this small pleasure ?
tr	Inf	Do you miss me ?
tr	Inf	Could you send me a set ?
tr	Inf	Could you send me a set ?
tr	Inf	This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG & E ' s headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
tr	Inf	This is to inform that a representative of Enron Corp would like to address the Commission on the issue of utility rate stabilization plans at the Commission ' s hearings scheduled for December 27th and 28th .
tr	Inf	Mike Day , our outside counsel , will make the presentation on our behalf .
tr	Inf	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Inf	The call in number is 800 . 713 . 8600 .
tr	Inf	Mike Day , our outside counsel , will make the presentation on our behalf .
tr	Inf	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Inf	The call in number is 800 . 713 . 8600 .
tr	Inf	I ' ll make the change .
tr	Inf	Will make that change .
tr	Inf	I ' ll not say anything .
tr	Inf	Just like what happened in Enron ' s initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects .
tr	Inf	Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon ' s West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
tr	Inf	Tom ' s group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis .
tr	Inf	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95 , 000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
tr	Inf	Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?
tr	Inf	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Inf	therefore they will not attempt to make this claim .
tr	Inf	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .
tr	Inf	I couldn ' t say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs . old ) and I waited for the bus .
tr	Inf	We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon .
tr	Inf	In addition , we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer .
tr	Inf	Where does our 50 % ( the 1 . 65 million dollars ) show up ?
tr	Inf	Can you provide me with more details ?
tr	Inf	1 . In Section 1 . 1 , there should be a parentheses after etc . in the 5th line .
tr	Inf	4 . In Section 6 . 2 . 1 I ' ll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue .
tr	Inf	9 . In the GTC , the ECP rep should also apply to EESI .
tr	Inf	10 . In Collateral Requests , insert a comma after deposit in the last line .
tr	Inf	I will also add granting / perfection language .
tr	Inf	I would add setoff language .
tr	Inf	1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer ' s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T & D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer ' s utility .
tr	Inf	"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers ."
tr	Inf	If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
tr	Inf	"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ..."
tr	Inf	If you are comfortable , we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms .
tr	Inf	I will start up again in mid - July ...
tr	Inf	Once we agree on the list , we can sign the EEI Master .
tr	Inf	Do you want 6 / 1 / 01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since they have not been settled ?
tr	Inf	Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the version that you sent to me the current version ?
tr	Inf	Will fax .
tr	Inf	Will fax .
tr	Inf	Will fax .
tr	Inf	We can accept the language with your chnages .
tr	Inf	Our credit person doesn ' t understand why the transferability language needs to be eliminated .
tr	Inf	With respect to the Guaranty , I will delete the Schedule .
tr	Inf	Our system did not show any other chnages .
tr	Inf	Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect .
tr	Inf	"You will notice that Questar has requested a "" Payment Plan "" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events ."
tr	Inf	Also , you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up , but to protect ourselves , we have added language in Para 3 . 2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax .
tr	Inf	After execution , we will forward a final copy to you for your files .
tr	Inf	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
tr	Inf	Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect .

tr	Inf	Can you and Tom join us ?
tr	Inf	Please call me , let ' s discuss .
tr	Inf	How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number ?
tr	Inf	We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page , we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers .
tr	Inf	Do you think we need to do more ?
tr	Inf	I just couldn ' t remember if it was you or Terry .

tr	Inf	Do you think we need to do more ?
tr	Inf	As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships .
tr	Inf	It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey .
tr	Inf	Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP .
tr	Inf	We will try to complete the I / C with the earliest in - service date possible , but with conditions as they are , a realistic date would be June 15 , 2002 .
tr	Inf	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
tr	Inf	My concern is that between now and then Dunn , the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief , which could be detrimental to generators / marketers ' claims .
tr	Inf	I ' ll get you the announcement .
tr	Inf	The subpoenas will force those involved , including Winter , to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee , and to turn over e - mails , personal calendars and memos .
tr	Inf	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .
tr	Inf	He didn ' t mention anything about it .
tr	Inf	Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .
tr	Inf	""" In our view , we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation ."
tr	Inf	We should resurrect Mike Smith ' s note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one .
tr	Inf	I can dig it up if you ' d like .
tr	Inf	Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter .
tr	Inf	Any news on how SCE and SDG & E will move forward ?
tr	Inf	I ' ll leave to Steve to structure the deal .
tr	Inf	By Friday December 1st , could you please tell me the percentages / amount of time you spent on East Coast Power during the months of October and November .
tr	Inf	In addition , could you look over the list below to see if there are any additional employees in your group that spent time on ECP , so we can ensure we bill all of our used resources to ECP .
tr	Inf	*** Mary Perkins - Could you forward the number of transactions and accounts .
tr	Inf	*** Jason Chumley - Could you forward the number of contractor hours and help / remote support hours .
tr	Inf	How does this look ?
tr	Inf	Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed ??
tr	Inf	Did you get my fax on Friday ?
tr	Inf	Now that Michelle is in your fold , do you want to reconsider her being the contact person with AAA on this ?
tr	Inf	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Inf	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Inf	Initially our design group , along with perhaps one of our technology consultants , would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half a day .?
tr	Inf	Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from finance , legal , and operations so that we get good cross - functional feedback about our services .?
tr	Inf	Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting .
tr	Inf	The real focus of the meeting will be on how we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B marketplaces .?
tr	Inf	We would like to meet between November 14 and ? December 1 ? since construction of our services is already underway .?
tr	Inf	Do you have a tel # for Mike ?
tr	Inf	I ' ll send a copy of the suit filed against the generators as soon as I get it .
tr	Inf	And you might think by reading this I blame the kids .....
tr	Inf	It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them .
tr	Inf	That will likely never change .
tr	Inf	People like this will never have my sympathy , nor do they deserve my sympathy .
tr	Inf	Just because you ' re stuck , doesnt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you .

tr	Inf	The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
tr	Inf	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
tr	Inf	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Inf	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Inf	Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
tr	Inf	""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President ."""
tr	Inf	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
tr	Inf	""" Commander In Chief "" doesn ' t mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
tr	Inf	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
tr	Inf	May God help us all .
tr	Inf	And may God bless America !

tr	Inf	"Dependant = NASA & Company to use "" space station "" model to unify the aims of different countries ."
tr	Inf	The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries .
tr	Inf	The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi - compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
tr	Inf	The Chinese program ' s second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques .
tr	Inf	The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
tr	Inf	""" They would get in line in front of the Russians ."
tr	Inf	"And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch ."""
tr	Inf	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .

tr	Inf	For the sake of mankind , you should email our verdict to your friends .
tr	Inf	Should the United States undertake military action against Iran , the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme .
tr	Inf	Iraq , already a seething cauldron , will sink further into chaos .
tr	Inf	Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below .
tr	Inf	The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude .
tr	Inf	The Stark could not see them to stop them .
tr	Inf	The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .
tr	Inf	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23 , 000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
tr	Inf	An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact , and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces .
tr	Inf	China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran , and will receive 150 , 000 barrels of oil per day from that field .
tr	Inf	Further , any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China ' s liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz .
tr	Inf	By dumping some portion of their reserves , these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U . S . interest rates skyrocketing .
tr	Inf	Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - China holds the cards .

tr	Inf	According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E . Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration .
tr	Inf	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .
tr	Inf	Iran ' s position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair .
tr	Inf	In the worst - case scenario , the newly - minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play , hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam .
tr	Inf	Therefore , any attack upon Iran ' s nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess .

tr	Inf	If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
tr	Inf	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Inf	You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .
tr	Inf	You also don ' t want it getting too warm for him too often .

tr	Inf	It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
tr	Inf	This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image .
tr	Inf	Hope this helps .
tr	Inf	Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation .
tr	Inf	Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor .
tr	Inf	Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
tr	Inf	When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections , accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too !

tr	Inf	Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?

tr	Inf	Things to do in Fujairah ..
tr	Inf	Nothing like Dubai , and never will be !

tr	Inf	I don ' t know should i buy PS3 or X - BOX Kinect .
tr	Inf	No matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
tr	Inf	I don ' t know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don ' t see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
tr	Inf	I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don ' t know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
tr	Inf	In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live ?

tr	Inf	How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
tr	Inf	Almost every day he ' d even wake me up like 5am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
tr	Inf	Do you think he ' s teething ?
tr	Inf	No worries , i didn ' t try .
tr	Inf	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Inf	He ' d just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
tr	Inf	I cant decide between height or width .
tr	Inf	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
tr	Inf	This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats .
tr	Inf	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Inf	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Inf	"I would strongly suggest "" The Breakfast Club "" in Chicago ."
tr	Inf	You can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices .

tr	Inf	Unless you plan on being late for the bridal shower you might want to post this again in the L . A . section .
tr	Inf	I don ' t think so
tr	Inf	It doesn ' t have to be underground it could be any type of music .
tr	Inf	The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
tr	Inf	Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
tr	Inf	Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa .
tr	Inf	Well first you can try speaking Japanese .
tr	Inf	The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
tr	Inf	You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
tr	Inf	You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .

tr	Inf	What size horse do i need ?
tr	Inf	I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
tr	Inf	But I would go for the base number of 15hh .
tr	Inf	A taller horse doesn ' t always mean a horse you can ' t handle .
tr	Inf	Anything smaller you will grow out , anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage , especially when riding .
tr	Inf	where would you go ?
tr	Inf	As you ' re from the States you ' ll have much more fun in London .
tr	Inf	You ' ll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
tr	Inf	I also highly recommend staying with a French family .

tr	Inf	How can i make my Jack Dempsey reproduce ?
tr	Inf	It doesn ' t work .
tr	Inf	You can ' t MAKE them mate , you can only encourage them .
tr	Inf	The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish , or a few of them , but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in .
tr	Inf	They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
tr	Inf	I don ' t have the money to take her to a vet right now but it ' s getting to be an issue .
tr	Inf	Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney , I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease , which untreated can lead to possible renal failure .
tr	Inf	Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream .
tr	Inf	Can i apply with 63 points ?
tr	Inf	The pass mark could change .
tr	Inf	"You should check for updated information on a regular basis ."""
tr	Inf	And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
tr	Inf	""" 4 . May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points ?"""
tr	Inf	""" If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada , the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion ( referred to as substituted evaluation ) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points ."""
tr	Inf	Sure you can apply .
tr	Inf	"Why have a "" minimum "" if it is going to be ignored ?"
tr	Inf	Can someone please make me feel better about this trip !!!!
tr	Inf	Well , I mean , you don ' t have to be mad about it .
tr	Inf	""" Nothing Gold Can Stay "", honey ."
tr	Inf	If they don ' t like it , it ' ll only be two days , remember ?
tr	Inf	do you get your visitors visa immediately at the airport ?
tr	Inf	do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
tr	Inf	or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
tr	Inf	An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
tr	Inf	You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
tr	Inf	You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
tr	Inf	You ' ll have a great time , so no worries there .
tr	Inf	What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
tr	Inf	if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks ?
tr	Inf	A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred * mutt * chicken .
tr	Inf	You don ' t say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can ' t say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
tr	Inf	However , I can say what features they would / could have .
tr	Inf	All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
tr	Inf	Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
tr	Inf	Feathered Feet / Shanks - Chicks could have feathered feet / shanks as this is also incomplete dominate .
tr	Inf	Crest : Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene .
tr	Inf	So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .
tr	Inf	Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
tr	Inf	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Inf	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Inf	deleting a question where you dont like the answer won ' t get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
tr	Inf	I do like the shadow , though .
tr	Inf	My suggestion is to pay close attention to what ' s going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
tr	Inf	In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
tr	Inf	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Inf	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Inf	As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
tr	Inf	Also , can animals remember images on TV like us , humans ?
tr	Inf	If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
tr	Inf	I wouldn ' t know -- I don ' t particularly like scary movies , and I haven ' t tried this with my pet .
tr	Inf	Although , I don ' t think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they ' ll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
tr	Inf	Do dogs enjoy watching T . V .?
tr	Inf	Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver ' s time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
tr	Inf	Rusted , torn corners in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse .
tr	Inf	I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
tr	Inf	Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
tr	Inf	Do they have this anywhere ?
tr	Inf	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Inf	Like you can pick the destinations ?
tr	Inf	( Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone .
tr	Inf	2 . Short of chartering your own ship and crew , I don ' t see any way you could customize your own itinerary .
tr	Inf	Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
tr	Inf	No possibility to customise ports of call .
tr	Inf	HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
tr	Inf	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Inf	We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
tr	Inf	Can rabbits and chickens live together ?
tr	Inf	So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
tr	Inf	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Inf	Rabbits do burrow also so don ' t be surprised if chicken are falling into holes .
tr	Inf	melting brass did not work ?
tr	Inf	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Inf	I ' ll just echo both other answers .
tr	Inf	Just the zinc fumes will get you , if you don ' t take precautions .
tr	Inf	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Inf	Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food ?
tr	Inf	They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
tr	Inf	I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which weren ' t a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
tr	Inf	I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
tr	Inf	It will become EU law in a couple of years .
tr	Inf	We can ' t dictate what business wants to open where .
tr	Inf	If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
tr	Inf	How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python ?
tr	Inf	They don ' t know ANYTHING about Ball pythons .
tr	Inf	Maybe if they see how much time and effort you ' ve devoted to researching the animal they ' ll reconsider .
tr	Inf	Once you ' ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
tr	Inf	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Inf	I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
tr	Inf	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Inf	I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
tr	Inf	Best answer shall receive points :)
tr	Inf	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Inf	"Ok so if youre snake will take pre - killed , you can "" gas it ""."
tr	Inf	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Inf	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Inf	I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane .
tr	Inf	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Inf	Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen / thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run .
tr	Inf	You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
tr	Inf	But , you could live where ever you fancy takes you .
tr	Inf	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Inf	But , can you immigrate ?
tr	Inf	Coming to stay , and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD .
tr	Inf	You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
tr	Inf	How to train my puppy ?
tr	Inf	He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
tr	Inf	And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , doesn ' t listen to me .
tr	Inf	How to prevent this ?
tr	Inf	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Inf	Anyone have any suggestion ?
tr	Inf	This way , he cannot reach the leash to chew it .
tr	Inf	why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
tr	Inf	or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
tr	Inf	What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs500 per night ?
tr	Inf	There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000 , close to the centre of these cities .
tr	Inf	In Delhi I ' d recommend Ajay Guesthouse .
tr	Inf	Must say , in Delhi it ' s hard to get good price / quality rating .
tr	Inf	In Varanasi I don ' t know .
tr	Inf	You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
tr	Inf	To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn is best to stay in delhi .
tr	Inf	TO Stay in Agra - Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you .
tr	Inf	To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel is you choice ...
tr	Inf	( plus they dont stink that bad )
tr	Inf	My favorite would have to be the rat .
tr	Inf	My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine wasn ' t ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
tr	Inf	I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
tr	Inf	Two males can fight and you definitely don ' t want babies !!
tr	Inf	They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
tr	Inf	Also they can ' t eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
tr	Inf	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Inf	I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
tr	Inf	Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
tr	Inf	They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
tr	Inf	They made need medication or deworming or something .
tr	Inf	They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
tr	Inf	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Inf	For $ 56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
tr	Inf	they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
tr	Inf	You can probably do it all on - line .
tr	Inf	If you were born elsewhere , start here .
tr	Inf	My parents didn ' t send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment .
tr	Inf	As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
tr	Inf	We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
tr	Inf	We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Inf	Usually you can ' t go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
tr	Inf	Where in the states could I go ?
tr	Inf	How long should I go for to each place ?
tr	Inf	& Also how much money would I need ?
tr	Inf	So I can start saving now hehe
tr	Inf	Leave High School ?
tr	Inf	Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you ' ve never traveled before and you don ' t put where you would be traveling from .
tr	Inf	What do you like to do ?
tr	Inf	Do you speak a foreign language ?
tr	Inf	I could spend a year in Spain alone .
tr	Inf	Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
tr	Inf	Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
tr	Inf	You can ' t beat the price for what you get .
tr	Inf	How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
tr	Inf	How could we make it settle in a new house .
tr	Inf	you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
tr	Inf	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Inf	you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
tr	Inf	he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
tr	Inf	he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
tr	Inf	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Inf	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Inf	he might even start peeing on things in fear .
tr	Inf	In time though she / he will adjust . :)
tr	Inf	I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
tr	Inf	My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
tr	Inf	I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wont work .
tr	Inf	He wont even get close to the crate .
tr	Inf	If I come towards him , he will run away .
tr	Inf	How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
tr	Inf	and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command .
tr	Inf	He wont do anything on command .
tr	Inf	I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog .
tr	Inf	I would start with a leash .
tr	Inf	At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
tr	Inf	If you push it , it will never work .
tr	Inf	He will learn to really like this .
tr	Inf	Potty outside will come at some point .
tr	Inf	where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
tr	Inf	Should I just settle and book on line ?
tr	Inf	If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
tr	Inf	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Inf	And no , I do not work for them . :)
tr	Inf	If you ' re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
tr	Inf	From either of those cities , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
tr	Inf	He ' ll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
tr	Inf	Because I don ' t feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
tr	Inf	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Inf	If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
tr	Inf	All this will help you use both legs evenly , keep proper contact and use your wight correctly , to keep your leg in a good position .
tr	Inf	BTW you dont want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
tr	Inf	When I first started doing it I ' d do it every day .
tr	Inf	i wouldn ' t bother with yoga i ' d practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , theres also a way to ride on your knees ?
tr	Inf	that help alot with your thigh muscles ( bareback though )
tr	Inf	ya i really wouldn ' t bother with the yoga
tr	Inf	maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i ' ve thought about getting one .
tr	Inf	You don ' t want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
tr	Inf	I really can ' t help you .
tr	Inf	What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis ?
tr	Inf	and will these antibiotics help ?
tr	Inf	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Inf	They didnt take x - rays they offered them but i just couldnt afford anymore treatment .
tr	Inf	I will give them and call and see what they say .
tr	Inf	To answer your questions in order :
tr	Inf	He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
tr	Inf	Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays )?
tr	Inf	2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn ' t think it would be helpful .
tr	Inf	He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ).
tr	Inf	And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just doesn ' t feel good .
tr	Inf	You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about .
tr	Inf	Did they do any x - rays ?
tr	Inf	I don ' t know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
tr	Inf	You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
tr	Inf	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
tr	Inf	They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
tr	Inf	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
tr	Inf	If she is nicer when you are alone I ' d say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
tr	Inf	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Inf	Unfair for the girl as boys don ' t have that kind of handicap , but that ' s the way our own rules work .
tr	Inf	Why not just take your chances and do it your way ?
tr	Inf	Your answer doesn ' t do anything but remind me that I ' m going to be $ 25 , 000 in debt by the time I ' m 22 .
tr	Inf	I didn ' t think I ' d be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
tr	Inf	* gasps * So I wouldn ' t make a good prostitute ?
tr	Inf	How would you know ?
tr	Inf	I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I ' ll be employable .
tr	Inf	And they ' ll probably add interest to what you ' ve already racked up .
tr	Inf	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they ' ll force you cough up .
tr	Inf	I wouldn ' t like not having the option to return to NZ .
tr	Inf	why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
tr	Inf	i don ' t know why he won ' t eat though !
tr	Inf	he doesn ' t seem to know that they are food .
tr	Inf	he wont even try to bite .
tr	Inf	do babies this small hibernate ?
tr	Inf	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
tr	Inf	If he doesn ' t seem interested in them at all I would say he ' s just not hungry .
tr	Inf	They can smell it so i ' m sure he knows what it is and just don ' t want it .
tr	Inf	In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
tr	Inf	Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding .
tr	Inf	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
tr	Inf	In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
tr	Inf	For example , some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall .
tr	Inf	help !?
tr	Inf	you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
tr	Inf	giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
tr	Inf	this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
tr	Inf	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn ' t now .
tr	Inf	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Inf	that will help to reassure him , and he will be less aggressive with her .
tr	Inf	when they play fight , they don ' t hiss .
tr	Inf	if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .
tr	Inf	putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .
tr	Inf	I can see how you get confused though . :)
tr	Inf	He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
tr	Inf	However , Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases .
tr	Inf	They could not defeat the Americans .
tr	Inf	However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
tr	Inf	The government did NOT fall .
tr	Inf	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Inf	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Inf	To make the war unpalatable to the American public .
tr	Inf	"My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the "" sun rays "" he needs ?"
tr	Inf	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that ' s the easy one to provide for .
tr	Inf	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Inf	I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly :
tr	Inf	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Inf	As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
tr	Inf	Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so its anyone ' s guess whether or not he ' ll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
tr	Inf	They dont want to be held or touched .
tr	Inf	They can do tricks and they arent messy .
tr	Inf	( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ).
tr	Inf	I would recommend that you get two parakeets .
tr	Inf	They sometimes dont get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
tr	Inf	Hopefully they will work for you .
tr	Inf	This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them .
tr	Inf	( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
tr	Inf	3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .
tr	Inf	( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food )....
tr	Inf	( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
tr	Inf	When they see that you arnt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .
tr	Inf	My sister and I would like to go to Ireland .
tr	Inf	We don ' t want too many tourists , and since we ' ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
tr	Inf	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Inf	Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?
tr	Inf	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Inf	Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular .
tr	Inf	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
tr	Inf	It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
tr	Inf	To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don ' t have a bus or train service .
tr	Inf	You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
tr	Inf	By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
tr	Inf	You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
tr	Inf	Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies ?
tr	Inf	If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below .
tr	Inf	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Inf	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Inf	With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
tr	Inf	Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .
tr	Inf	Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .
tr	Inf	You also may need to treat the incubation water .
tr	Inf	Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult ' s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
tr	Inf	If a pair isn ' t leaving eggs ... check the following :
tr	Inf	Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .
tr	Inf	However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo .)
tr	Inf	In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container .
tr	Inf	Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .
tr	Inf	Other will add a drop of Methylene blue .
tr	Inf	Should I get a balcony ?
tr	Inf	Any tips or advice to make this a great experience ??
tr	Inf	There can be many ideas ; one can see numerous options passing through their mind .
tr	Inf	Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids , which best suit you can select ?
tr	Inf	Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
tr	Inf	Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
tr	Inf	They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
tr	Inf	Also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion .
tr	Inf	To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option .
tr	Inf	You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
tr	Inf	I would suggest a warmer season , but not Spring Break or early summer .
tr	Inf	You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays .
tr	Inf	With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
tr	Inf	You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
tr	Inf	Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
tr	Inf	Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
tr	Inf	Well , I ' ll try to make this short .
tr	Inf	""" Well , if you ever just want to see me I ' ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after ."""
tr	Inf	I don ' t know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
tr	Inf	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Inf	Anyway , I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all .
tr	Inf	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Inf	Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
tr	Inf	And yes , I do like him .
tr	Inf	To answer Barry White , yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he ' s waiting for .
tr	Inf	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Inf	He will call you back Im sure !
tr	Inf	would You like going for * coffee * with him ?
tr	Inf	If i were you I would Go ...
tr	Inf	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
tr	Inf	Edit ... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing ..
tr	Inf	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
tr	Inf	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Inf	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Inf	He can eat all his feed and doesn ' t drop any , but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
tr	Inf	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
tr	Inf	So I might get the horse and see what I can do .
tr	Inf	Think I should do it ?
tr	Inf	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Inf	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Inf	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
tr	Inf	I will have the EPM test done before treating .
tr	Inf	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Inf	I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .
tr	Inf	I don ' t know .
tr	Inf	You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study .
tr	Inf	West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn ' t always include a fever .
tr	Inf	You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .
tr	Inf	A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .
tr	Inf	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Inf	I would highly recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a quality tattoo done .
tr	Inf	I would rate Fran pcs an A + because the price was lower than everyone else , i got my computer back the next day , and the professionalism he showed was great .
tr	Inf	"As a qualified criminal defense attorney , he will work every possible legal "" angle "" ( leaving no stone unturned ) of your case to achieve the most favorable result possible ."
tr	Inf	I would recommend him to anyone .
tr	Inf	You will find the same to be true for you .
tr	Inf	Fantastic Place to buy your next vehicle
tr	Inf	Good beer good service and what more could you want .
tr	Inf	Incredibly rude and I will not return to it .
tr	Inf	I would recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo .
tr	Inf	They don ' t take coupons .
tr	Inf	Where else can you go for $ 10 and recieve this treatment ?!
tr	Inf	Who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave !
tr	Inf	I don ' t get it .
tr	Inf	seriously , can you imagine having to live through these last few nights without heat ?
tr	Inf	Cannot ask for a better experience .
tr	Inf	Can ' t you make a decent cup of coffee ?
tr	Inf	No amount of sugar and milk can mask it .
tr	Inf	But furniture like this will truly be around forever .
tr	Inf	I would recommend them to anyone ..
tr	Inf	You can ' t go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
tr	Inf	To make a order you may have to go to back of line .
tr	Inf	And then wait again .
tr	Inf	I didn ' t end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
tr	Inf	Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free , even if you didn ' t buy your car there !
tr	Inf	I would recommend them to anyone !
tr	Inf	I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer .
tr	Inf	The staff will not even answer the phone for take out .
tr	Inf	I don ' t get it .
tr	Inf	For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
tr	Inf	Make You Feel Like a Number
tr	Inf	You NEVER get a human on the phone .
tr	Inf	Service does not get any better !!!!
tr	Inf	I would recommend her to anyone !
tr	Inf	Maybe next time they will have it .
tr	Inf	Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
tr	Inf	she didnt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it !
tr	Inf	i wont go back !
tr	Inf	If you watch a lot of fights ( youtube ) and research some of the history ( http :// en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bullfighting ) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more !
tr	Inf	Also after seeing a handful of bullfights , I can say that they ' re a lot more enjoyable if you ' re smashed ( BAC >= . 15 ).
tr	Inf	All I can say is that I am glad I went in !
tr	Inf	i coldn ' t find anywere else local to fix it so i took it there and they fixed it for $ 150 ...
tr	Inf	excellent , top guys a +++++ reccommend to anyone !!!!!!!!!!
tr	Inf	If you have some problems with your windows , you should call them .

tr	Inf	THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE , I GUARANTEE IT .
tr	Inf	Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just cant find in a lot of stores .
tr	Inf	I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago
tr	Inf	How do these places stay in business .
tr	Inf	I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
tr	Inf	Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
tr	Inf	If you need someone to help you out with your heating problems , I DEFINITELY would call TIGER HEATING and AIR .
tr	Inf	Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else .
tr	Inf	He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home !
tr	Inf	As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
tr	Inf	I don ' t recommend this place .
tr	Inf	When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tr	Inf	While I hope I don ' t have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I ' ll definitely use this firm again .
tr	Inf	Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery .
tr	Inf	Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel ' s chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
tr	Inf	When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday !
tr	Inf	I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again .
tr	Inf	They don ' t seem to be interested in selling cars .
tr	Inf	Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
tr	Inf	A bit pricey , so I didn ' t go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
tr	Inf	One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore .
tr	Inf	I don ' t want to waste my time with them .
tr	Inf	A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
tr	Inf	Will definitely return .
tr	Inf	If you must use them , be vigilant and be ready to push , if you can go elsewhere then I would .
tr	Inf	And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
tr	Inf	They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS , they will NOT take it back !
tr	Inf	I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
tr	Inf	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .

tr	Inf	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere , amazing food , and great customer service !
tr	Inf	I would recommend these apartments to anybody !

tr	Inf	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
tr	Inf	I would recommend him to everyone !
tr	Inf	The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if your looking fot a good game and aren ' ta nerd , dont ask them .
tr	Inf	First and Last time we ' ll eat there
tr	Inf	Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else .
tr	Inf	I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb . com
tr	Inf	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you ' ll love Vetri .
tr	Inf	I would highly recommend David to anyone .
tr	Inf	He will exceed your expectations !
tr	Inf	He doesn ' t just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won ' t even notice that there ' s a camera there .

tr	Inf	They don ' t care one bit about you !!!!!
tr	Inf	To just come over and hang out ?!?

tr	Inf	I wouldn ' t go there again .
tr	Inf	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Inf	Other than that , I would recommend living here . :)
tr	Inf	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Inf	I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
tr	Inf	"Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , "" one can see forever "" a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur ."
tr	Inf	and most correctly , us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife .
tr	Inf	I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal .
tr	Inf	I cannot say enough about this place .
tr	Inf	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Inf	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
tr	Inf	I normally don ' t write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one won ' t be getting my business , nor my family ' s , nor my co - workers .
tr	Inf	Highly Recommend
tr	Inf	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
tr	Inf	I would recommend her highly !
tr	Inf	They won ' t have a second chance from me .
tr	Inf	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Inf	I did not have a good experience w / Dr . Ghassemlou .
tr	Inf	you ' ll love it
tr	Inf	I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr . de Barros .
tr	Inf	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can ' t see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
tr	Inf	I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color )!
tr	Inf	I cannot recommend this salon enough !!!
tr	Inf	If you cannot park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center ' s garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
tr	Inf	I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
tr	Inf	I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
tr	Inf	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Inf	Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
tr	Inf	Rate a church ?
tr	Inf	Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light .
tr	Inf	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
tr	Inf	I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
tr	Inf	I wouldn ' t send my dogs there .
tr	Inf	Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc . THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN ' T PAID .
tr	Inf	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
tr	Inf	I didn ' t even buy the bag there !
tr	Inf	Might try again
tr	Inf	Don ' t know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
tr	Inf	Other Thoughts : Will try this place again .
tr	Inf	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Inf	i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car .
tr	Inf	if you don ' t mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
tr	Inf	They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
tr	Inf	I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need .
tr	Inf	Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
tr	Inf	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
tr	Inf	If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
tr	Inf	( For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me !)
tr	Inf	Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
tr	Inf	Very affordable ( don ' t call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
tr	Inf	You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
tr	Inf	Over priced for students to learn !
tr	Inf	You can fool people
tr	Inf	With higher than average prices to boot !
tr	Inf	You won ' t even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
tr	Inf	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
tr	Inf	( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
tr	Inf	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
tr	Inf	To warn you to stay away from this place just isn ' t enough .
tr	Inf	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
tr	Inf	Can ' t wait to go back !!!
tr	Inf	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Inf	We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
tr	Inf	He did warm it up .
tr	Inf	So yes , I wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
tr	Inf	I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
tr	Inf	There could have ( hopefully doesn ' t have ) major damage to the engine .
tr	Inf	I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
tr	Inf	Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything , and smile while doing it .
tr	Inf	However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
tr	Inf	They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
tr	Inf	I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever .
tr	Inf	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Inf	I could not understand any his reasons .
tr	Inf	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
tr	Inf	My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
tr	Inf	The instructor did not show up !
tr	Inf	Well , not much I can say except I ' m very disappointed with this experience .
tr	Inf	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
tr	Inf	I don ' t want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I don ' t want to take on something I can ' t handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
tr	Inf	They may look young but don ' t let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
tr	Inf	So we didn ' t expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
tr	Inf	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Inf	I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here .
tr	Inf	You ' d think they would do a good job but they don ' t care unless they are getting paid full price .
tr	Inf	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
tr	Inf	How much could it possibly cost ?
tr	Inf	I also appreciate their honesty .
tr	Inf	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
tr	Inf	Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be .
tr	Inf	Don ' t go !
tr	Inf	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Inf	They don ' t speak the best English but enough to get by .
tr	Inf	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
tr	Inf	I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
tr	Inf	Wouldn ' t go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
tr	Inf	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
tr	Inf	They don ' t just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
tr	Inf	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Inf	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Inf	I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
tr	Inf	But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
tr	Inf	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
tr	Inf	Will look beautiful .
tr	Inf	I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
tr	Inf	Either these people don ' t know anything about what they are renting , or worse - they are bait and switching .
tr	Inf	Didn ' t hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
tr	Inf	"Whereas my answer to the question "" Where do you get your laundry done ?"" used to be , "" At the checkout line at WalMart ,"" I can honestly say the answer now is , "" At The Laundry Tub ."""
tr	Inf	I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
tr	Inf	I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
tr	Inf	They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it ' s not room temperature at best when you get it home .
tr	Inf	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
tr	Inf	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Inf	But I ' d go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
tr	Inf	Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
tr	Inf	So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
tr	Inf	One more thing , they don ' t take any credit cards or checks .
tr	Inf	My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
tr	Inf	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Inf	That being said , I don ' t know how their delivery service is .
tr	Inf	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
tr	Inf	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Inf	ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR .
tr	Inf	NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD .
tr	Inf	also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it delivered **.
tr	Inf	anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
tr	Inf	Perhaps they don ' t deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
tr	Inf	A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
tr	Inf	Short time later the guy would leave , then the girl .
tr	Inf	If I found a spot , I couldnt fit in it .
tr	Inf	Not only did they answer the phone at 4 : 50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
tr	Inf	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Inf	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
tr	Inf	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my * ss .
tr	Inf	A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good , right ?
tr	Inf	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
tr	Inf	First of all , if you call for an appointment they won ' t tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
tr	Inf	"They also don ' t tell you that they ' re going to mail you an "" application "" to be admitted to be a patient ."
tr	Inf	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that ' s a common misconception ( http :// www . consumerreports . org / health / healthy - living / beauty - personal - care / hair - loss - 10 - 08 / hair - loss . htm ).
tr	Inf	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
tr	Inf	If you want miracles you ' ll have to go to 21st St .
tr	Inf	They don ' t do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
tr	Inf	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
tr	Inf	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Inf	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Inf	The window didn ' t break !
tr	Inf	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Inf	I mean , I don ' t care if he doesn ' t know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there ' s no way I ' m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
tr	Inf	Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
tr	Inf	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
tr	Inf	I will NEVER go here again .
tr	Inf	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Inf	And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
tr	Inf	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Inf	I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
tr	Inf	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Inf	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner ' s own unprofessionalism .
tr	Inf	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club ' s actual OWNER ?!
tr	Inf	I will never recommend this gym to any woman .
tr	Inf	I will never go back .
tr	Inf	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Inf	I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
tr	Inf	The other person working at the store didn ' t know that I still had this table coming .
tr	Inf	No one will give me a date .
tr	Inf	How do you lose a drawer .
tr	Inf	Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service .
tr	Inf	Gerry , I can ' t thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear .
tr	Inf	But we don ' t just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
tr	Inf	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Inf	You don ' t have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
tr	Inf	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Inf	and you will go back for more !!!
tr	Inf	and we don ' t know them except for eating there .
tr	Inf	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
tr	Inf	What you can learn from the below ' bad experience '.
tr	Inf	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
tr	Inf	Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
tr	Inf	In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
tr	Inf	Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
tr	Inf	If they think you ' ve taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1 . 50 per can .
tr	Inf	# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
tr	Inf	( By whom , I don ' t know .
tr	Inf	Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that didn ' t exist .
tr	Inf	Don ' t get the rooms off the two kitchens .
tr	Inf	I ' d go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I wouldn ' t pay their rack rate .
tr	Inf	"The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "" everyone "" is going to "" love "" the food , decor and service ."
tr	Inf	Though they are mostly excellent , you generally don ' t get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
tr	Inf	And my -- no , I still don ' t remember what I had .
tr	Inf	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you ' ve never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
tr	Inf	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
tr	Inf	MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store .
tr	Inf	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Inf	Do other brides fall for this ???
tr	Inf	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Inf	"I didn ' t think so but you could be right ."""
tr	Inf	Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
tr	Inf	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Inf	Of course I couldn ' t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ).
tr	Inf	The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
tr	Inf	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Inf	I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ).
va	Fin	From the AP comes this story :
va	Fin	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .
va	Fin	Bush nominated Jennifer M . Anderson for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , replacing Steffen W . Graae .
va	Fin	Bush also nominated A . Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals , replacing John Montague Steadman .
va	Fin	Today ' s incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace .
va	Fin	Nervous people make mistakes , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks .
va	Fin	In the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station , killing several people .
va	Fin	The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe .
va	Fin	In Fallujah , hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride .
va	Fin	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Fin	The US troops fired into the hostile crowd , killing 4 .
va	Fin	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Fin	Usually , these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up , but this time people are actually concerned about the company ' s plans .
va	Fin	"They work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company who ' s stated goals include "" Don ' t be evil ,"" they imagine a company who ' s eventually history will be "" Don ' t be profitable ."""
va	Fin	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Fin	Read the entire article ; there ' s a punchline , too .
va	Fin	""" Arafat ' s secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky ."
va	Fin	The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
va	Fin	Arafat ' s death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled .
va	Fin	Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
va	Fin	Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon ' s murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before .
va	Fin	"The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , "" condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq ."""
va	Fin	Ash - Sharq al - Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike .
va	Fin	US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead .
va	Fin	In Ramadi , there was a big demonstration .
va	Fin	"Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was "" criminal "" and that "" the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad ""."
va	Fin	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Fin	"This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region ,"" the message claimed ."
va	Fin	"Xinhua alleged that "" Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation ."""
va	Fin	Now , people wonder if Google can even survive .
va	Fin	That ' s overstating it , I know .
va	Fin	What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it ' s always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
va	Fin	Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
va	Fin	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
va	Fin	It ' s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
va	Fin	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
va	Fin	Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
va	Fin	Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
va	Fin	An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
va	Fin	""" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in ,"" Masoud Shojai , head of the country ' s "" Iran Cartoon "" association and the fair organizer , said ."
va	Fin	""" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison ,"" he added ."
va	Fin	Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran ' s Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
va	Fin	He added that around 1 , 100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
va	Fin	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Fin	When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
va	Fin	When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
va	Fin	US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance .
va	Fin	Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
va	Fin	Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
va	Fin	Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
va	Fin	In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
va	Fin	The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance .
va	Fin	The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
va	Fin	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Fin	Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .
va	Fin	For some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog .
va	Fin	[ Am at a conference and can ' t blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days .]
va	Fin	The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons .
va	Fin	Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
va	Fin	At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
va	Fin	Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
va	Fin	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’ s ever seen .
va	Fin	President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
va	Fin	With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
va	Fin	Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
va	Fin	North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
va	Fin	The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
va	Fin	America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’ s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
va	Fin	I ran across this item on the Internet .
va	Fin	"The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U . S . citizens ( most of whom were "" dual - citizens "")."
va	Fin	Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U . S . citizen .
va	Fin	In other words , those Americans were there by their own choice , mired in a situation that was totally predictable .
va	Fin	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U . S . citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
va	Fin	That ' s right , folks .
va	Fin	Here ' s an excerpt from the article :
va	Fin	Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
va	Fin	The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
va	Fin	""" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home ,"" Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit ."
va	Fin	""" We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us ."
va	Fin	Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20 , 000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
va	Fin	Here ' s a tip : Don ' t get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter - attack !
va	Fin	Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making .
va	Fin	"Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin ' s "" White House Briefing "" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ):"
va	Fin	At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
va	Fin	This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn ' t anticipated .
va	Fin	""" Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there ' s a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President ."
va	Fin	""" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that ."
va	Fin	There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I don ' t know .
va	Fin	My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job .
va	Fin	But if -- there ' s a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
va	Fin	It ' s a Western scene by a guy named W . H . S . Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Fin	It ' s on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O ' Neill in Midland , Texas .
va	Fin	He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
va	Fin	""" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer ."
va	Fin	This is not a filibuster .
va	Fin	That ' s a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
va	Fin	Laura and I are Methodists .
va	Fin	One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn .
va	Fin	I have .
va	Fin	The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .
va	Fin	I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can .
va	Fin	""" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep ."
va	Fin	And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
va	Fin	Now that ' s a rambling response .
va	Fin	"And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "" A Charge to Keep ""?"
va	Fin	"That was the name of his "" autobiography "" -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 ."
va	Fin	It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
va	Fin	I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
va	Fin	Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
va	Fin	He announced this in January :
va	Fin	As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc . of Mountain View , California .
va	Fin	I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
va	Fin	He also announced this in January :
va	Fin	Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25 , 2005 :
va	Fin	Following on the heels of Ben ' s annoucement yesterday , I thought I ' d post that I have joined Google as well .
va	Fin	Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
va	Fin	Ben made another announcement on March 28 , 2005 :
va	Fin	I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
va	Fin	Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years ,...
va	Fin	In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
va	Fin	In this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 .
va	Fin	This is one thought - provoking film .
va	Fin	Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer .
va	Fin	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Fin	They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
va	Fin	I ' m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non - Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they ' re ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
va	Fin	It ' s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
va	Fin	Malach , What you say makes sense .
va	Fin	Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go .
va	Fin	It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis - matches .
va	Fin	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr ' s movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
va	Fin	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
va	Fin	At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ?
va	Fin	One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
va	Fin	State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
va	Fin	The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up .
va	Fin	Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ).
va	Fin	They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick .
va	Fin	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
va	Fin	The Washington Monthly ' s Who ' s Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
va	Fin	"Sept . 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept . 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "" protect Israel ,"" according to the Asian Times ."
va	Fin	I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
va	Fin	But they haven ' t been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
va	Fin	Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
va	Fin	This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at .
va	Fin	There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don ' t want to fall into it .
va	Fin	But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
va	Fin	""" I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas ,"" Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah ."
va	Fin	Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas .
va	Fin	""" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same ,"" al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad ."
va	Fin	The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
va	Fin	I ' m not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
va	Fin	Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for .
va	Fin	Bryan , you ' re in , right ?
va	Fin	Let me know

va	Fin	those dogs aren ' t even friendly .
va	Fin	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Fin	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Fin	Deal your meal from where the dishes are located .
va	Fin	I . E . the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
va	Fin	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .

va	Fin	Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ), the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala .
va	Fin	In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth .
va	Fin	But within a few short months , the village people began to notice their wells were running dry , so they complained to the corporation .
va	Fin	Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams .
va	Fin	After several years of use , we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant ' s waste sludge and is laden with cadmium , a highly toxic , cancer - causing heavy metal .
va	Fin	Moral of the story : Don ' t drink Coke .......... drink Pepsi !
va	Fin	The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center ( GNOFHAC ) filed a housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans ( HANO ) last week .
va	Fin	The complaint , filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St . Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St . Thomas , now known as River Garden .
va	Fin	The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St . Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement .
va	Fin	Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .
va	Fin	""" In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever ."
va	Fin	"As such , it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement ,"" said James Perry , GNOFHAC Executive Director"

va	Fin	In London , the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery advanced 53 cents to 64 . 73 dollars .
va	Fin	After brushing the Florida Keys islands on Tuesday , Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico .
va	Fin	"The US National Hurricane Center said Rita was "" extremely dangerous "" and could become a top - level category five storm on the Saffir - Simpson scale ."
va	Fin	The storm threatened oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico where about one - quarter of US oil operations are based .
va	Fin	Oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm ' s progress kept global markets on tenterhooks .

va	Fin	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Fin	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Fin	NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
va	Fin	Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world .
va	Fin	On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
va	Fin	""" That kind of a financial incentive [...] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge ,"" Griffin said ."

va	Fin	Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat ' s legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood .
va	Fin	It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
va	Fin	Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel ' s partially completed West Bank barrier .
va	Fin	Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
va	Fin	"Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue "" very important and very dangerous ."""
va	Fin	In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
va	Fin	"Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "" unrestricted "" strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight ."
va	Fin	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Fin	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Fin	Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
va	Fin	""" We ' re not happy with Hamas ' s position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians ,"" commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official ."
va	Fin	""" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda ."""
va	Fin	""" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel ' s scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure ,"" Habib said ."
va	Fin	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."
va	Fin	"Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war ."""

va	Inf	"I do not find the term "" Alternate Transporter Imbalance "" in our agreement .."
va	Inf	Do you have this information ?
va	Inf	Please forward a copy of the J . M . Huber Corporation Guaranty to my attention .
va	Inf	Can you send me the data you used : I shall take a look at it .
va	Inf	Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign .
va	Inf	What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo ' s resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer .
va	Inf	When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group .
va	Inf	I can take him as a summer intern .
va	Inf	I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology .

va	Inf	If you would like , we can set up a conference call with you , myself , and Larry to go over the payment methodology .
va	Inf	However , I still don ' t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares .
va	Inf	Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account .
va	Inf	I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done .

va	Inf	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
va	Inf	"If Abbas keeps up this "" macho talk "" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank ."
va	Inf	Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
va	Inf	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
va	Inf	Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

te	Fin	What if Google Morphed Into GoogleOS ?
te	Fin	What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e - mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
te	Fin	( And , by the way , is anybody else just a little nostalgic for the days when that was a good thing ?)
te	Fin	This BuzzMachine post argues that Google ' s rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we ' ve all heard before , but it ' s particularly well - put in this post .
te	Fin	Google is a nice search engine .
te	Fin	They own blogger , of course .
te	Fin	Is that a money maker ?
te	Fin	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Fin	Click here To view it .
te	Fin	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Fin	One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah .
te	Fin	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Fin	Compare the flags to the Fallujah one .
te	Fin	You have to see these slides .... they are amazing .
te	Fin	Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google ' s new toolbar , which , as noted in the linked article , commits just about every sin an online marketer could commit , and makes up a few new ones besides .
te	Fin	I ' m not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument
te	Fin	However , this toolbar is really bad news .
te	Fin	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Fin	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
te	Fin	But there is no proof .
te	Fin	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
te	Fin	They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti - proliferation treaty .
te	Fin	Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure .
te	Fin	One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage .
te	Fin	Angry crowds chanted anti - American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop . 256 , 000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday .
te	Fin	"Reuters reported that "" Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today ."""
te	Fin	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Fin	"Let aggressive ( American ) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city ' s security and safety , and ask them to lift their hands from the city ."""
te	Fin	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders .
te	Fin	Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country ' s wealth and power .
te	Fin	They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .
te	Fin	See http :// www . gulf - news . com / Articles / news . asp ? ArticleID = 97508
te	Fin	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v . Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D . C . Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
te	Fin	The actual vote is a little confusing .
te	Fin	Stay with me now : John Paul STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV , VI through VI - D - iii , VI - D - v , and VII , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined , and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI - D - iv , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined .
te	Fin	BREYER filed a concurring opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG joined .
te	Fin	KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II .
te	Fin	SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO joined .
te	Fin	THOMAS filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA joined , and in which ALITO joined as to all but Parts I , II - C - 1 , and III - B - 2 .
te	Fin	ALITO filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III .
te	Fin	I had to go to the BBC for this report .
te	Fin	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Fin	It ' s just disappointing .
te	Fin	Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .
te	Fin	At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .
te	Fin	Two weeks later , and the violence continues .
te	Fin	The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15 , 000 , according to analysts .
te	Fin	So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .
te	Fin	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Fin	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Fin	Which essentially sounds like he ' s worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
te	Fin	I assume his actual reason is that he ' s worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can ' t grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
te	Fin	I ' m not sure how the market will react .
te	Fin	On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
te	Fin	em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .
te	Fin	He mentions his wife ' s death having an effect on him .
te	Fin	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Fin	Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :
te	Fin	To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria ' s promised withdrawal .
te	Fin	This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .
te	Fin	The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
te	Fin	Wtf is this ?
te	Fin	This is a terrorist organization plain and simple .
te	Fin	This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80 ' s and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?
te	Fin	This is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .
te	Fin	The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .
te	Fin	That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .
te	Fin	Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans .
te	Fin	"In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "" raiding forces "" in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins ."
te	Fin	"The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , "" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah ."
te	Fin	"Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral ."""
te	Fin	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .
te	Fin	"The statement said , "" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal ."""
te	Fin	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Fin	Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti - Shiite pogroms .
te	Fin	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :
te	Fin	"U . S . Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "" war with Islamic fascists ,"" saying the term could inflame anti - Muslim tensions ."
te	Fin	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Fin	Which is why he didn ' t say we ' re at war with Islamic people .
te	Fin	We ' re at war with Islamic fascists .
te	Fin	And if you haven ' t heard by now , the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :
te	Fin	Nabeel Hussain , 21 , Waltham Forest Lest you be confused with the suspects from an earlier plot foiled in Canada a few months ago : Fahim Ahmad , 21 , Toronto ;
te	Fin	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Fin	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Fin	This pledge is a new development .
te	Fin	One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .
te	Fin	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Fin	This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush ' s aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .
te	Fin	It is a setback for the war on terror .
te	Fin	"Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "" Afghan Arabs "" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden ."
te	Fin	After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .
te	Fin	Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .
te	Fin	They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .
te	Fin	( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ).
te	Fin	So now there are hundreds of al - Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before .
te	Fin	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Fin	Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush .
te	Fin	Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .
te	Fin	This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .
te	Fin	"The answer is , "" Yes !"""
te	Fin	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
te	Fin	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Fin	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .
te	Fin	The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ).
te	Fin	"Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were "" no good targets "" in Afghanistan ."
te	Fin	Neither did Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz .
te	Fin	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Fin	Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
te	Fin	As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .
te	Fin	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
te	Fin	You also need Pakistani air space .
te	Fin	The plan was all set and could have succeeded .
te	Fin	But in fall of 1999 , Gen . Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .
te	Fin	The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .
te	Fin	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn ' t use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
te	Fin	Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .
te	Fin	But for those of you tempted in that direction , please look up Carter ' s Tabas operation .
te	Fin	Clinton tried , and tried hard .
te	Fin	The gods weren ' t with us on that one .
te	Fin	"that is how i want you to refer to me as "" the king """

te	Fin	The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995 .
te	Fin	The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of ' 67 .
te	Fin	The Dow then sank to 631 in December of ' 70 .
te	Fin	A big rally then took the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of ' 73 , turning everyone bullish .
te	Fin	Think that was bad - by December of ' 74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 .
te	Fin	Of course , that was the bottom
te	Fin	And that ' s the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down .

te	Inf	"Over three years after 9 - 11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "" terrorist "" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts ."
te	Inf	The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .

te	Inf	Launching this way will hopefully avoid future disasters , giving more support towards NASA revisiting the stars .

te	Part	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
te	Part	He has denied this .
te	Part	Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there , since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals .
te	Part	Important news such as President Bush ' s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti - gay ( update : he ' s not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
te	Part	And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .
te	Part	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).

te	Part	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."

te	Part	The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .
te	Part	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .
te	Part	U . S . officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .
te	Part	"By using the word "" Islamic "" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier ."

te	Part	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Part	Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia ' s some 15 million citizens .
