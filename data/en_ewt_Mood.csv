tr	Ind	Al - Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border .
tr	Ind	DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad .
tr	Ind	Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior !
tr	Ind	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J . Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s .
tr	Ind	The third was being run by the head of an investment firm .
tr	Ind	You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets .
tr	Ind	The cells were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al - Jihad districts of the capital .
tr	Ind	Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don ' t find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful .
tr	Ind	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Ind	Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul .
tr	Ind	The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings .
tr	Ind	On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home .
tr	Ind	In Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated .
tr	Ind	( Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population , who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in .
tr	Ind	This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center - north of the country .)
tr	Ind	In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district .
tr	Ind	Guerrillas killed an engineer , Asi Ali , from Tikrit .
tr	Ind	They also killed Shaikh Hamid ' Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit .
tr	Ind	His mother was also killed in the attack .
tr	Ind	Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half .
tr	Ind	Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers .
tr	Ind	One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
tr	Ind	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Ind	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Ind	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Ind	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Ind	This item is a small one and easily missed .
tr	Ind	But in my view it is highly significant .
tr	Ind	The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas .
tr	Ind	Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran .
tr	Ind	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Ind	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Ind	Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership .
tr	Ind	The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way .
tr	Ind	If someone committed a crime against humanity , prosecute the person .
tr	Ind	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Ind	Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
tr	Ind	A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died .
tr	Ind	The trial begins again Nov . 28 .
tr	Ind	In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya .
tr	Ind	Baghdadis don ' t venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more , you never know where you might get stuck .
tr	Ind	There has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again .
tr	Ind	My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non - stop .
tr	Ind	Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
tr	Ind	Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars , they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area , then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK - 47 ' s in the air .
tr	Ind	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year , which indicates they are the same people .
tr	Ind	And there is nothing we can do about it really , people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land .
tr	Ind	Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood , and those are trained and armed , so don ' t expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn ' t bomb them , and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen ?
tr	Ind	Everyone is apprehensive , there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days .
tr	Ind	Most people haven ' t gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal is ).
tr	Ind	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Ind	Mosques are calling for donating blood , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah , most of them returned later though .
tr	Ind	What irritates me is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi ' ite clerics , we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance , and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as ' Ba ' athists ', ' Saddamites ', ' Wahhabis ', and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago .
tr	Ind	So what happened ?
tr	Ind	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Ind	Speaking of Fallujah , we have only Al - Jazeera to rely on for our news from there .
tr	Ind	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al - Sahhaf .
tr	Ind	""" They are targetting ambulances "", "" American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women "", and "" They are using cluster bombs against civilians "" is all you get to hear from him ."
tr	Ind	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Ind	Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents .
tr	Ind	Over 300 Iraqis are reported dead and 500 wounded in Fallujah alone .
tr	Ind	Al - Iraqiyah tv said that ICDC were controlling Ramadi .
tr	Ind	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Ind	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Ind	Elena ' s motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
tr	Ind	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Ind	This is not a post about fault - finding or assigning blame .
tr	Ind	It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
tr	Ind	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
tr	Ind	This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following :
tr	Ind	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
tr	Ind	Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
tr	Ind	In the last decade , there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise .
tr	Ind	The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .
tr	Ind	However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
tr	Ind	Here are some excerpts :
tr	Ind	The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
tr	Ind	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post - accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
tr	Ind	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Ind	There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl .
tr	Ind	Being well - informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
tr	Ind	There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl .
tr	Ind	These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl :
tr	Ind	I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing .
tr	Ind	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Ind	Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray ?
tr	Ind	That too was stopped .
tr	Ind	Don ' t have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks -- there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl .......
tr	Ind	The Chernobyl Children ' s Project ( http :// www . adiccp . org / home / default . asp ) offers several ways to help the children of that region .
tr	Ind	One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
tr	Ind	S . and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
tr	Ind	The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming , and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have .
tr	Ind	I ' m sorry to say Elena ' s story has been revealed to be a fake .
tr	Ind	What do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
tr	Ind	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
tr	Ind	The tape was a way to signal priorities .
tr	Ind	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Ind	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Ind	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Ind	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .
tr	Ind	MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelters Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .
tr	Ind	They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .
tr	Ind	All this is highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot schemes .
tr	Ind	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Ind	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Ind	The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism , and even the threat of nuclear war , than Iraq ever did .
tr	Ind	Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .
tr	Ind	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Ind	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Ind	Israel owes the United States at least this much , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace .
tr	Ind	Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there .
tr	Ind	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .
tr	Ind	Certainly , the Shiites already hate al - Qaeda and would help ; likewise the Kurds .
tr	Ind	The problem of mollifying the Sunnis , though , has to be solved to avoid giving al - Qaeda an entrée .
tr	Ind	The Americans have to put away their free - market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households .
tr	Ind	We need an FDR in Iraq , not a Ronald Reagan .
tr	Ind	Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn ' t nearly as good a rallying cry for al - Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out .
tr	Ind	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Ind	George W . Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .
tr	Ind	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Ind	' Bush fails reporter ' s pop quiz on international leaders
tr	Ind	"Texas Gov . George W . Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those names ."
tr	Ind	The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
tr	Ind	Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan .
tr	Ind	"Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as "" Lee ."""
tr	Ind	""" Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan ?"""
tr	Ind	Hiller asked , inquiring about Gen . Pervaiz Musharraf , who seized control of the country October 12 .
tr	Ind	""" Wait , wait , is this 50 questions ?"" asked Bush ."
tr	Ind	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Ind	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Ind	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Ind	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Ind	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Ind	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Ind	A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush ' s comments .
tr	Ind	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Ind	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Ind	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Ind	I can ' t tell you how ominous I found Bush ' s performance in that interview .
tr	Ind	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Ind	"He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with "" stability ."""
tr	Ind	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Ind	He couldn ' t tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
tr	Ind	Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year .
tr	Ind	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Ind	"This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "" stability "" to the region in fall of 1999 ."
tr	Ind	So , one answer to Bush ' s charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
tr	Ind	Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then .
tr	Ind	Indeed , given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US , one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does .
tr	Ind	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Ind	"Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the U . S . has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians ."""
tr	Ind	I don ' t see Bush doing any of this .
tr	Ind	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti - American terrorism .
tr	Ind	Israel , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
tr	Ind	Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
tr	Ind	Have they , however , actually weakened Israeli security ?
tr	Ind	The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements .
tr	Ind	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings .
tr	Ind	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Ind	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
tr	Ind	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Ind	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Ind	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
tr	Ind	Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians .
tr	Ind	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Ind	He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
tr	Ind	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Ind	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Ind	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Ind	The bungling of post - war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state .
tr	Ind	Armed militias , many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience , have proliferated .
tr	Ind	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
tr	Ind	Anti - Israeli and pro - Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents .
tr	Ind	The more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran ' s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
tr	Ind	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
tr	Ind	Worse for Israel , the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites .
tr	Ind	These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein ' s regime , but have now organized and armed themselves .
tr	Ind	They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
tr	Ind	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Ind	Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine .
tr	Ind	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , which is popular in Jordan .
tr	Ind	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post - Saddam Iraq are no exception .
tr	Ind	Whereas Saddam Hussein ' s dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , they are now free to organize .
tr	Ind	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .
tr	Ind	Israel ' s security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
tr	Ind	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Ind	The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world , including Iraq .
tr	Ind	The promotion by the pro - Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened , not strengthened , Israeli security .

tr	Ind	THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global
tr	Ind	Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
tr	Ind	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Ind	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Ind	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Ind	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Ind	And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s four - day visit to India recently .
tr	Ind	According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
tr	Ind	For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga ' s government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
tr	Ind	""" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one ."
tr	Ind	"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive ,"" Muni told IPS ."
tr	Ind	Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
tr	Ind	But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .
tr	Ind	Kumaratunga ' s India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .
tr	Ind	Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .
tr	Ind	But they , too , failed .
tr	Ind	Colombo , too , seems to be in an intractable position .
tr	Ind	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Ind	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Ind	Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .
tr	Ind	""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement ,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview ."
tr	Ind	In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .
tr	Ind	Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .
tr	Ind	However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .
tr	Ind	About 1 , 200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .
tr	Ind	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Ind	Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US $ 4 . 5 billion .
tr	Ind	Japan ' s special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
tr	Ind	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Ind	"The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces ."""
tr	Ind	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Ind	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Ind	""" Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process ,"" TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement ."
tr	Ind	"She added that recent visits to the island by India ' s top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island ""."
tr	Ind	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Ind	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Ind	The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession .
tr	Ind	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""
tr	Ind	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Ind	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Ind	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Ind	Musharraf calls the bluff
tr	Ind	While most U . S . secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with , few have been as brazen as Colin Powell .
tr	Ind	Two years ago , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements .
tr	Ind	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Ind	The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
tr	Ind	That distinction has now gone to the United States .
tr	Ind	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Ind	India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China ( which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
tr	Ind	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Ind	"This , Pakistan ' s lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told , is the "" minimum "" that the Pakistan army will accept ."
tr	Ind	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
tr	Ind	This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu - majority Jammu , a Buddhist - dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley , with the third state given little of taxpayers ' money but substantial autonomy .
tr	Ind	With luck , the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist , education and services haven within India .
tr	Ind	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Ind	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Ind	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Ind	"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
tr	Ind	Despite Sept . 11 , the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Ind	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Ind	"That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "" foreigner - led "" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism , has not struck the conferees , among whom have been several Indian "" scholars "" and "" analysts "" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna ."
tr	Ind	Despite many wrinkles , India remains a part - democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op - ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly .
tr	Ind	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Ind	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
tr	Ind	Since then , India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell ' s bluff , challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands .
tr	Ind	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Ind	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Ind	"Under President Hu Jintao , Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year , making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U . N . Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "" permanent five "" that has not yet done so ."
tr	Ind	With Colin Powell around , the U . S . has no need of an Osama bin Laden
tr	Ind	M . D . Nalapat , an expert on jihad , is professor of geopolitics at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education , India .
tr	Ind	We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam .
tr	Ind	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Ind	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Ind	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Ind	The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
tr	Ind	During this time , F - 102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand .
tr	Ind	As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
tr	Ind	In all this so - called controversy , has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets ?
tr	Ind	They don ' t let just anybody do it .
tr	Ind	Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush ' s service in the Texas Air National Guard .
tr	Ind	For example , did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry ?
tr	Ind	What follows is the text of an e - mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ).
tr	Ind	Before you fall for Dems ’ spin , here are the facts
tr	Ind	What do you really know about George W . Bush ’ s time in the Air National Guard ?
tr	Ind	That he didn ’ t show up for duty in Alabama ?
tr	Ind	That he missed a physical ?
tr	Ind	That his daddy got him in ?
tr	Ind	News coverage of the president ’ s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
tr	Ind	So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :
tr	Ind	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
tr	Ind	Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
tr	Ind	That was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training periods thrown in as well .
tr	Ind	It was full - time work .
tr	Ind	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Ind	After training , Bush kept flying , racking up hundreds of hours in F - 102 jets .
tr	Ind	As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
tr	Ind	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Ind	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Ind	Bush earned 340 points in 1969 - 1970 .
tr	Ind	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Ind	He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
tr	Ind	And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
tr	Ind	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Ind	Did you know that ?
tr	Ind	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti - Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ).
tr	Ind	Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .
tr	Ind	His superior officers said OK .
tr	Ind	Requests like that weren ’ t unusual , says retired Col . William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
tr	Ind	“ In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots ,” Campenni says .
tr	Ind	“ The Vietnam War was winding down , and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs .
tr	Ind	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Ind	In fact , you were helping them solve their problem .”
tr	Ind	So Bush stopped flying .
tr	Ind	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Ind	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Ind	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Ind	Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .
tr	Ind	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Ind	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Ind	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Ind	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Ind	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Ind	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer .”
tr	Ind	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Ind	Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry ’ s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
tr	Ind	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Ind	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it ’ s important or not in November .
tr	Ind	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Ind	And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush ’ s service , while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry ’ s .
tr	Ind	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty .”
tr	Ind	Earlier , Kerry said , “ Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question .”
tr	Ind	Now , after the Swift boat episode , the spotlight has returned to Bush .
tr	Ind	That ’ s fine .
tr	Ind	Byron York is a White House correspondent for National Review .
tr	Ind	His column appears in The Hill each week .
tr	Ind	One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
tr	Ind	I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week .
tr	Ind	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Ind	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5 , 000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
tr	Ind	Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas .
tr	Ind	Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi ' s Al - Iraqiya list .
tr	Ind	Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
tr	Ind	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' gifts ' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi , a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis .
tr	Ind	Sheikh Naji Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list .
tr	Ind	Indeed , Sistani ' s agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
tr	Ind	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Ind	Again there is no official written statement from Sistani ' s office confirming this allegation , which I think is intentional .
tr	Ind	Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha ' lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
tr	Ind	"Chalabi describing Sha ' lan as a "" Ba ' athist "" and a "" former double agent for Saddam and the CIA "", while Sha ' lan dismisses Chalabi as a "" thief "" and an "" Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran ""."
tr	Ind	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Ind	It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha ' lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
tr	Ind	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Ind	The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
tr	Ind	Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
tr	Ind	I doubt that will be the outcome though .
tr	Ind	Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
tr	Ind	The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
tr	Ind	Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
tr	Ind	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
tr	Ind	Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April , 2004 , with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques .
tr	Ind	I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
tr	Ind	After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can ' t mention here .
tr	Ind	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Ind	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Ind	Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation .
tr	Ind	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
tr	Ind	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Ind	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Ind	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Ind	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Ind	But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I don ' t believe the US is going anywhere so soon .
tr	Ind	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Ind	The only hope now is that , following the elections , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties .
tr	Ind	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba ' athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
tr	Ind	Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
tr	Ind	Very recently , US forces in Al - Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul - Razaq Inad Al - Gu ' ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe .
tr	Ind	Al - Gu ' ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government .
tr	Ind	The Gu ' ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al - Anbar governor some months back .
tr	Ind	The Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid - nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe .
tr	Ind	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
tr	Ind	Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
tr	Ind	Al - Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident .
tr	Ind	I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
tr	Ind	Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
tr	Ind	Even partition is not a possibility , there are no clear borders between the two .
tr	Ind	Here ' s a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , published yesterday .
tr	Ind	"("" At first I hid a lot ."
tr	Ind	I thought the US government was looking for me .
tr	Ind	"Now I hide a lot less ."")"
tr	Ind	Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials .
tr	Ind	I can ' t imagine they wanted to do this .
tr	Ind	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Ind	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Ind	And though he ' d been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
tr	Ind	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
tr	Ind	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Ind	But then , maybe that wouldn ' t have saved him either , because Posada is not Meiring .
tr	Ind	"Meiring ' s crimes are fresh , and wave the false flag which is the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Ind	They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
tr	Ind	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Ind	Posada ' s crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who don ' t know their history .
tr	Ind	And to those who don ' t even know their crimes , not even that .
tr	Ind	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Ind	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Ind	Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference ; justice would not be served then .
tr	Ind	But Posada ' s nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that ' s a vain hope .
tr	Ind	Meiring is more than an embarrassment .
tr	Ind	"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Ind	Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
tr	Ind	Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
tr	Ind	I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives .
tr	Ind	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
tr	Ind	Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell ' s whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics .
tr	Ind	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross - examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .
tr	Ind	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
tr	Ind	Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
tr	Ind	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Ind	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Ind	Then Charles A . Briggs came to the rescue .
tr	Ind	"Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records "" for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P . Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA ."""
tr	Ind	"The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson did not work "" directly or indirectly "" for the CIA since retiring ."
tr	Ind	Last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , threw out Wilson ' s two - decades old conviction .
tr	Ind	Judge Hughes wrote : ` government knowingly used false evidence against him ,' concluding ` honesty comes hard to government .'
tr	Ind	looks like it is rearing its head again in Louisianna ..
tr	Ind	Sheriff ' s deputies in Louisiana made a third arrest Wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of children and animals at a Ponchatoula , La ., church .
tr	Ind	Austin Aaron Bernard III , 36 , was arrested on a charge of aggravated rape of a child under the age of 13 .
tr	Ind	Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church .
tr	Ind	Tangipahoa Parish sheriff ' s deputy Christopher Blair Labat , 24 , was booked Tuesday on one count of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature .
tr	Ind	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .
tr	Ind	We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose .
tr	Ind	If I was Rummy I ' d send Posada to Iraq to blow things up there .
tr	Ind	Yesterday evening , the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany ( ARD , Tagesthemen ).
tr	Ind	The newly released papers , showing him complicit in the airliner bombing , were mentioned
tr	Ind	Now that ' s a post I can relate to .
tr	Ind	You really got me thinking , I enjoy reading this blog .

tr	Ind	+ As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Ind	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Ind	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
tr	Ind	In early February , India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ).
tr	Ind	These alleged members of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have been charged with illegal entry .
tr	Ind	It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar .
tr	Ind	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Ind	Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels .
tr	Ind	It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea .
tr	Ind	Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , which took a heavy toll on the Andamans .
tr	Ind	"Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy ' s Far Eastern Naval Command , now being established along with India ' s "" blue water navy ""."
tr	Ind	Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
tr	Ind	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Ind	The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base .
tr	Ind	The drugs and arms travel in all directions .
tr	Ind	"Since the "" Sea Tigers "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
tr	Ind	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Ind	This is not unknown to New Delhi .
tr	Ind	A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands , using fake Indian ration cards , while citizens of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave .
tr	Ind	""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell ' s Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	"An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50 , 000 "" foreigners "" in the Andaman Islands , but unofficial figures are much higher than this ."
tr	Ind	A large number of them are Bangladeshis , who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere .
tr	Ind	As most of them have few technical skills , and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case , they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities .
tr	Ind	The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns , cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous .
tr	Ind	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Ind	"One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying , "" Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region ."""
tr	Ind	Considering the islands ' huge strategic importance , it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been .
tr	Ind	These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily , bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia .
tr	Ind	As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Ind	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Ind	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
tr	Ind	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Ind	Indian intelligence ' s lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling .
tr	Ind	This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid - 1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time .
tr	Ind	In 2001 , according to Indian army officials , security forces launched a wide - ranging operation in the 300 - some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar , and found huge caches of arms .
tr	Ind	"The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "" other terrorist groups ""."
tr	Ind	The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo .
tr	Ind	In addition , LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers .
tr	Ind	The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now - defunct Asiaweek in 2001 .
tr	Ind	A shipment of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars , left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex - Joux 3 .
tr	Ind	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Ind	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Ind	In 1997 , the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition .
tr	Ind	Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket - propelled - grenade launchers , 20 assault rifles , M - 79 grenade launchers and more than 10 , 000 rounds of ammunition .
tr	Ind	Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People ' s Front .
tr	Ind	Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
tr	Ind	The boat was heading toward Cox ' s Bazar in Bangladesh .
tr	Ind	Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante , an island off the coat of Myanmar , west of the Andaman islands .
tr	Ind	Subsequently , Phuket became the LTTE ' s main backup base .
tr	Ind	A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
tr	Ind	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Ind	The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building - up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less - strong militant groups .
tr	Ind	Over the past decade , Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness .
tr	Ind	A number of extremist groups , under the cover of the Islamist movement , have become active in drug trafficking , gun running and anti - Indian activities .
tr	Ind	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Ind	As a result , north of the Andaman Islands , Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms .
tr	Ind	A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan .
tr	Ind	The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox ' s Bazar passes through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong .
tr	Ind	India ' s Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1 , 000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal .
tr	Ind	Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia .
tr	Ind	The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans , which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south .
tr	Ind	On South Andaman , the most heavily populated island , is Port Blair , which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago .
tr	Ind	Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non - Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island .

tr	Ind	He also writes for Aakrosh , India ' s defense - tied quarterly journal .
tr	Ind	[ Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Ind	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Ind	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Ind	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Ind	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate . ]
tr	Ind	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Ind	The neighbours are still interfering , but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’ s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it .
tr	Ind	“ The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all .
tr	Ind	Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan ,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan ’ s English daily The Nation .
tr	Ind	All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process , but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Ind	That changed on September 22 when President George W . Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
tr	Ind	The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non - interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban .
tr	Ind	Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting , said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully .
tr	Ind	‘’ Where are Mullah Omar , Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar ?’’
tr	Ind	Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf .
tr	Ind	All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan .
tr	Ind	( Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban , Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb - e - Islami .)
tr	Ind	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Ind	‘’ Bush was very well briefed before the meeting ,’’ the diplomat said .
tr	Ind	An Afghan official at the meeting added , ‘’ The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda .’’
tr	Ind	Karzai was clearly pleased at the results .
tr	Ind	‘’ President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban ,’’ says Karzai .
tr	Ind	The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans .
tr	Ind	Until then he had said Pakistan ’ s options were open .
tr	Ind	However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
tr	Ind	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Ind	However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
tr	Ind	‘’ Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before ,’’ says Lt . General David Barno .
tr	Ind	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Ind	Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .
tr	Ind	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Ind	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Ind	Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .
tr	Ind	Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders , who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency .
tr	Ind	With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections , the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .
tr	Ind	Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
tr	Ind	With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home .
tr	Ind	Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt . General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
tr	Ind	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Ind	Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Ind	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Ind	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Ind	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Ind	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate .
tr	Ind	Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
tr	Ind	Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also .
tr	Ind	In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai , Iran , Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai .
tr	Ind	Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .
tr	Ind	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Ind	However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same .
tr	Ind	With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’ s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced .
tr	Ind	However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates .
tr	Ind	Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran ’ s border .
tr	Ind	The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners .
tr	Ind	Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan ’ s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai ’ s campaign against warlords .
tr	Ind	At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’ s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo - conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively , the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran .
tr	Ind	Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand .
tr	Ind	However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran .
tr	Ind	‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters ,’’ says Barno .
tr	Ind	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .
tr	Ind	‘’ Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran .
tr	Ind	So far what they have done together has been good for us and that ’ s how we would like to keep it ’’, says Karzai .
tr	Ind	Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan ’ s neighbours is over , but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours ’ interference .
tr	Ind	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Ind	In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections , they would be resisted .
tr	Ind	Many Taliban living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai .
tr	Ind	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Ind	The debate that a handful of Texas multi - millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry ' s war record is absurd in every way .
tr	Ind	The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
tr	Ind	Most of those making the charges have even flip - flopped , contradicting themselves .
tr	Ind	Or they weren ' t eyewitnesses and are just lying .
tr	Ind	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Ind	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Ind	He has never lived in a war zone .
tr	Ind	If some of John Kerry ' s wounds were superficial , Bush received no wounds .
tr	Ind	( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn ' t absent yourself from it .
tr	Ind	That is the logic of the medal ).
tr	Ind	Kerry saved a man ' s life while under fire .
tr	Ind	Bush did no such thing .
tr	Ind	What was Bush doing with his youth ?
tr	Ind	He was drinking .
tr	Ind	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Ind	He gave no service to anyone , risked nothing , and did not even slack off efficiently .
tr	Ind	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Ind	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Ind	"( Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet , "" Let heads roll !"")"
tr	Ind	That temper is only one problem .
tr	Ind	Bush has a sadistic streak .
tr	Ind	He clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching executions .
tr	Ind	His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
tr	Ind	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Ind	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Ind	"Even for those who later abstain , "" visual - spatial abilities , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , are the slowest to recover ."""
tr	Ind	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Ind	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Ind	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Ind	Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
tr	Ind	But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
tr	Ind	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Ind	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Ind	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Ind	"There is one place in Alabama where Mr . Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Ind	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Ind	NPR ' s Wade Goodwyn has this report about Mr . Bush ' s time on that campaign .
tr	Ind	In 1972 , Baba Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign .
tr	Ind	Groom was Republican Red Blount ' s scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
tr	Ind	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Ind	It was a Texas accent .
tr	Ind	But he just melded with everybody .
tr	Ind	GOODWYN : The candidate Mr . Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business .
tr	Ind	Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days .
tr	Ind	Blount ' s support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon ' s postmaster general .
tr	Ind	In Washington , Blount became friends and tennis partners with Mr . Bush ' s father , then Congressman Bush .
tr	Ind	That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father ' s urging . . .
tr	Ind	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Ind	Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural counties didn ' t have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
tr	Ind	But throughout Alabama , there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to help Red Blount .
tr	Ind	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Ind	Groom says this job helped Mr . Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics are local .
tr	Ind	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Ind	Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr . Bush was not one of them .
tr	Ind	Mr . MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ): Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid - evenings .
tr	Ind	GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of ' 72 , Red Blount ' s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr . Bush ' s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
tr	Ind	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George certainly didn ' t seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there .
tr	Ind	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Ind	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Ind	After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr . Bush about it .
tr	Ind	The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
tr	Ind	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George didn ' t have any interest at all in talking about the military .
tr	Ind	In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
tr	Ind	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Ind	GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr . Bush enjoyed his freedom .
tr	Ind	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Ind	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Ind	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Ind	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Ind	Mr . ARCHIBALD : People have different ways of starting the days in any office .
tr	Ind	They ' re going to talk about their kids , they ' re going to talk about football , they ' re going to talk about the weather .
tr	Ind	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Ind	GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr . Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
tr	Ind	Mr . ARCHIBALD : I mean , at that time , I was 28 ; George would have been 25 or 26 .
tr	Ind	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Ind	I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
tr	Ind	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Ind	Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- didn ' t like that story .
tr	Ind	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Ind	Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn ' t remember George telling drunk stories .
tr	Ind	"But that means nothing , since they weren ' t the sort of things guys like Bush told the "" girls ""."
tr	Ind	He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him .
tr	Ind	Again , decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
tr	Ind	Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger .
tr	Ind	It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .
tr	Ind	When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
tr	Ind	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
tr	Ind	Afraid I don ' t have time today to discuss these , but some stories need attention :
tr	Ind	"From Wednesday ' s Mirror the headline , "" Have 200 , 000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists ?"""
tr	Ind	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Ind	The 99 - tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia .
tr	Ind	But the four planeloads of arms have vanished .
tr	Ind	Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense .
tr	Ind	But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
tr	Ind	And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered .
tr	Ind	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Ind	"Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : "" It ' s unbelievable that no one can account for 200 , 000 assault rifles ."
tr	Ind	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Ind	American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq .
tr	Ind	But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights , which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005 .
tr	Ind	"A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "" any weapons from Bosnia "" and added they were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia ""."
tr	Ind	Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US , British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents .
tr	Ind	"A NATO spokesman said : "" There ' s no tracking mechanism to ensure they don ' t fall into the wrong hands ."
tr	Ind	"There are concerns that some may have been siphoned off ."""
tr	Ind	This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re - routed to al - Qaeda .
tr	Ind	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Ind	It ' s always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration ' s harshest mainstream critics .
tr	Ind	"But then , even to talk of an "" administration "" may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative government means in the United States these days , and how much of "" national security "" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns ."
tr	Ind	"Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "" lost "" in Iraq , planeloads of arms don ' t just "" vanish ""; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout ' s untouchable stature ."
tr	Ind	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Ind	Meanwhile , a decision ' s been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson .
tr	Ind	And it ' s guilty :
tr	Ind	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Ind	The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
tr	Ind	Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .
tr	Ind	An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
tr	Ind	""" It was about how he could humiliate her the most ,"" prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments ."
tr	Ind	""" He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself ."""
tr	Ind	"After the sentencing one of Robinson ' s tearful supporters "" turned to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [ SNAP ], who had helped reopen the case , and told her , ' I hope you rot in hell !'"""
tr	Ind	More than ever , police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes , even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions .
tr	Ind	When victims and witnesses stay silent , nothing changes .
tr	Ind	When victims and witnesses speak up , at least sometimes a child is protected , the truth is exposed , and justice is done .
tr	Ind	Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ... the man who reopened the investigations last year , is mysteriously stepping down .
tr	Ind	And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation .
tr	Ind	SNAP is right in part .
tr	Ind	Police and prosecutors have the tools .
tr	Ind	The will is another matter .
tr	Ind	Some do , individually .
tr	Ind	That ' s still the domain of those who don ' t .
tr	Ind	lots of important stories out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good souls for that conviction .
tr	Ind	Have you sent this to congress yet ?
tr	Ind	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
tr	Ind	"Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI ' s list of "" Ten Most Wanted Fugitives ,"" a move that caps law enforcement ' s dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ...[ because of ] the impact that the group ' s practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women ."
tr	Ind	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Ind	"Specifically , Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "" spiritual "" marriages for girls and older men ."
tr	Ind	"At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state officials said Jeffs "" is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards ."""
tr	Ind	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Ind	As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo - Nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs has preached racism as well .
tr	Ind	""" The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth ,"" Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center ' s "" Intelligence Report ."""
tr	Ind	"An editorial in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "" the state ' s history , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet ' s nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach lawmakers and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities ."""
tr	Ind	Maybe I ' m missing something here , but how , exactly , does one ' Loose ' 200 , 000 AK47 ' s ?
tr	Ind	""" There ' s no tracking mechanism in place ""?!?!?"
tr	Ind	I ' m sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
tr	Ind	We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming ....
tr	Ind	i count like 14 explosive headlines .
tr	Ind	Then , of course , there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case ...
tr	Ind	Funny how some things are squirelled away by well - meaning prosecutors ...
tr	Ind	Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
tr	Ind	I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
tr	Ind	Of course law enforcement has dragged it ' s feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
tr	Ind	Personally I don ' t give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
tr	Ind	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
tr	Ind	Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life .
tr	Ind	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
tr	Ind	Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time .
tr	Ind	a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
tr	Ind	It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child .
tr	Ind	The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure .
tr	Ind	One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father ' s own brother .
tr	Ind	no one was charged for forced marriage , only the beating .
tr	Ind	"So we "" lost "" some weapon ?"
tr	Ind	It ' s a good thing too .
tr	Ind	What ' s a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash ?
tr	Ind	They really are milking the incompetence angle though , aren ' t they ?
tr	Ind	Christ , you ' d think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots .
tr	Ind	I suppose that it ' s damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots .
tr	Ind	US outsourcing special ops , intelligence to Iraq terror group , intelligence officials say
tr	Ind	The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ...
tr	Ind	A country deserves the leaders it has , my friends ...
tr	Ind	And MEK -- the Iranian ( not Iraqi ) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult :
tr	Ind	As the leaders like to boast , the Mujahedeen is a family affair .
tr	Ind	('' We have three generations of martyrs : grandmothers , mothers , daughters .'')
tr	Ind	Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf , where they lived separated from their parents .
tr	Ind	Family visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays .
tr	Ind	When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
tr	Ind	When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
tr	Ind	Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
tr	Ind	'' Every morning and night , the kids , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute them and shout praises to them ,'' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told me .
tr	Ind	Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
tr	Ind	Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France .
tr	Ind	The Rajavis , Afshari went on to say , '' saw these kids as the next generation ' s soldiers .
tr	Ind	They wanted to brainwash them and control them .''
tr	Ind	One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don ' t know what they are , don ' t care , or know perfectly well .

tr	Ind	Bush successfully makes Satan look good in comparison .
tr	Ind	""" Another generation of heavy metal has taken over , and -- sorry -- it ain ' t just about strippers and dope ."
tr	Ind	Okay , it ' s partly about strippers and dope .
tr	Ind	But more and more , as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone , it has gotten to be something weirder .
tr	Ind	It ' s become a guardian of morality -- not church morality ; real morality .
tr	Ind	"Praise be : Given the void in responsible behavior among governments , police , educational establishments and religions , the task of guiding our youth down the path of righteousness has fallen to ... Satan """
tr	Ind	The people who carry out these underground arms / drugs / sex trafficking deals are trauma based mind controlled slaves .
tr	Ind	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Ind	The wikipedia entry for Aerocom is just a stub .. waiting for someone to put some information into it ....
tr	Ind	You know , nature hates a void . :)
tr	Ind	i agree , Hmmmmmm .
tr	Ind	How are chants of death and suicide ... morality .
tr	Ind	"And were the Columbine killers acting out this "" real morality "" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates ."
tr	Ind	They were death metal brainwashed fans , literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
tr	Ind	( not church morality , no that is phoney , love thy neighbor ... hell no , kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????)
tr	Ind	I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article .
tr	Ind	I think the jury ' s still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers .
tr	Ind	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter - cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but doesn ' t apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
tr	Ind	The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .
tr	Ind	Irony is dead ... Long live Irony !
tr	Ind	That ' s it .
tr	Ind	I ' m firing my editor .
tr	Ind	Well , it ' s not as simple and clear cut as all that .
tr	Ind	We ' re entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio - political - spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection .
tr	Ind	The following quote is from that Coogan article :
tr	Ind	Imaginary evil is romantic and varied ; real evil is gloomy , monotonous , barren , boring .
tr	Ind	Imaginary good is boring ; real good is always new , marvelous , intoxicating .
tr	Ind	The answer is likely D : all of the above , due to this being a complex reality we live in .
tr	Ind	But to me , without question , they often know perfectly well .
tr	Ind	Here is a thought : When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Ind	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ""."
tr	Ind	& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old .
tr	Ind	"Since the article was specifically about "" death metal "" I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality :"
tr	Ind	One man ' s relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post - war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year .
tr	Ind	In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino , both just 16 , disappeared .
tr	Ind	They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home .
tr	Ind	The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together .
tr	Ind	But their parents refused to accept this .
tr	Ind	Michele Tollis , Fabio ' s father , began to attend metal concerts and festivals across Europe , handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio ' s friends .
tr	Ind	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Ind	No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
tr	Ind	It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
tr	Ind	During this search , Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son ' s disappearance .
tr	Ind	""" No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked ."
tr	Ind	"They ' re inseparable ,"" he says ."
tr	Ind	"Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : "" To hell with death ""."
tr	Ind	"I wholly agree , and would expand that statement to include : "" To hell with death metal ""."
tr	Ind	The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
tr	Ind	They are doing it deliberately .
tr	Ind	Do you really think GWB , and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth ?
tr	Ind	( I know , ignorant question ) Then why call them , or any other phonies ' Christians ', even if they themselves claim the appellation .
tr	Ind	They are merely imposters .
tr	Ind	Everything they claim is a lie , and this above all .
tr	Ind	This only serves their purposes .
tr	Ind	They want to be identified as ' Christians ', and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician ' s practice of the inversion principle .
tr	Ind	We need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
tr	Ind	... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Ind	Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
tr	Ind	Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of ' degenerate art ' in 1937 , while curating a parallel show of ' Aryan ' art across the street .
tr	Ind	The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result .
tr	Ind	Here ' s a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst ( Degenerate Art ) exhibit of 1937 :
tr	Ind	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Ind	Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .
tr	Ind	When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Ind	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ."""
tr	Ind	Are the adherent of ' Crowleyan Thelema ' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect ' energy ?'
tr	Ind	Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place ?
tr	Ind	Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the ' imaginary ' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon , which is this global system .
tr	Ind	Is the distinction accurate and valid ?
tr	Ind	Does the distinction actually exist ?
tr	Ind	This is where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum comes into play .
tr	Ind	so , enemy , what ' s your point ?
tr	Ind	Why don ' t you state it ?
tr	Ind	My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
tr	Ind	Here ' s another interesting example :
tr	Ind	( Don ' t wish to use Wikipedia again , it ' s just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information .)
tr	Ind	Balance died in 2004 after a ' fall .'
tr	Ind	He blended belief systems such as Shamanism , Christianity , Buddhism , Paganism , Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil ' s vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners .
tr	Ind	Not 200 , 000 guns - the numbers dont work :
tr	Ind	5kg per gun , 200 , 000 guns means 1000 tonnes , impossible for 4 containers .
tr	Ind	If the load was 99 tonnes there were probably less than 20 , 000 .
tr	Ind	Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers .
tr	Ind	""" I am , therefore I think "" :)"
tr	Ind	Reporting from the town where Susan Polk ' s trial is going on .
tr	Ind	I went across the bay last night to attend a farmer ' s market and music event .
tr	Ind	Lo and behold , the Mormons were there with a booth .
tr	Ind	I was amazed at the spiel they delivered .
tr	Ind	I resisted asking any questions that would have required either of them to think .
tr	Ind	Has anyone read the letter purportedly from Ahmadinejad to George Bush ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t know if this has been verified .
tr	Ind	But succintly making point after succint point , the text of the letter stands on its own merit , regardless .
tr	Ind	I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W ' s head if he were to actually read the letter , but it is hard to picture him actually reading this letter .
tr	Ind	"As I read the letter , I considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it , vs . that of the mind of the man who once said "" Bring it on !"""
tr	Ind	America , your condition is dire , dark and deep .
tr	Ind	"Of the metal music farce , Ministry has definately made in - road into ' Loose Change ""-"" Alex Jones "" territory with their new record , Rio Grande Blood ."
tr	Ind	They have been accumulating for years , and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever he feels like it .
tr	Ind	== Why did Bush revoke Executive Order 13011 today ?
tr	Ind	In scanning the whitehouse . gov site today , I noticed the following Executive Order :
tr	Ind	I can ' t believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI .
tr	Ind	I ' m wary of jumping into this fray without backup , that ' s for damn sure . :)
tr	Ind	I ' m a regular poster but for some reason blogger won ' t let me in today ... but sign me TroubleFunk .
tr	Ind	Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
tr	Ind	For example , is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?
tr	Ind	Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
tr	Ind	Similarly , is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system ?
tr	Ind	In regards to death metal , the problem is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture .
tr	Ind	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
tr	Ind	Tronicus , if you ' re still checking this thread :
tr	Ind	A bit of a knee - jerk reaction from me there , and I apologize for my over - generalizations .
tr	Ind	My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion .
tr	Ind	True believers are dangerous animals .
tr	Ind	I just get hung up on ' Christians ', as they ' re the dominant form where I come from .
tr	Ind	Also , I ' m quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses .
tr	Ind	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush ' s claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
tr	Ind	"I seem to remember something about ' by their works shall ye know them ."""
tr	Ind	I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
tr	Ind	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
tr	Ind	Sub - cultures ( as the lable implies ) do not develope in a vacuum .
tr	Ind	Again , I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly .
tr	Ind	These people are dangerous wether they ' re head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers '.
tr	Ind	( The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic ....)
tr	Ind	I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non - violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it ' s important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
tr	Ind	The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns , and then 200 , 000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus .
tr	Ind	I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US ' s local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
tr	Ind	It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi - nation corporation .
tr	Ind	It ' s a long but very worthwhile read .
tr	Ind	""" As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological "" entertainment "" in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come ."
tr	Ind	I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
tr	Ind	My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
tr	Ind	You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
tr	Ind	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
tr	Ind	I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non - Arab and also significant non - Moslem minorities .
tr	Ind	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
tr	Ind	Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
tr	Ind	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Ind	The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Ind	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Ind	The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Ind	Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
tr	Ind	Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60 ' s because of Israel .
tr	Ind	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Ind	The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Ind	The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
tr	Ind	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
tr	Ind	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Ind	They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
tr	Ind	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Ind	Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
tr	Ind	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Ind	Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
tr	Ind	According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U . N ., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
tr	Ind	The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
tr	Ind	Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
tr	Ind	And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
tr	Ind	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Ind	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Ind	A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
tr	Ind	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Ind	They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
tr	Ind	Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
tr	Ind	The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
tr	Ind	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Ind	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Ind	* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder .*
tr	Ind	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
tr	Ind	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Ind	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Ind	Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
tr	Ind	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
tr	Ind	September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
tr	Ind	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
tr	Ind	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
tr	Ind	So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
tr	Ind	It creates headlines .
tr	Ind	It is spectacular .
tr	Ind	It is frightening .
tr	Ind	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Ind	It is always shown on television in great detail .
tr	Ind	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Ind	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
tr	Ind	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
tr	Ind	The U . S . and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
tr	Ind	But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
tr	Ind	And it is a war !
tr	Ind	What is behind the suicide murders ?
tr	Ind	Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
tr	Ind	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
tr	Ind	No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
tr	Ind	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
tr	Ind	No relative of anyone influential has done it .
tr	Ind	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Ind	Aren ' t they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
tr	Ind	Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
tr	Ind	They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
tr	Ind	Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
tr	Ind	The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
tr	Ind	It never happens there .
tr	Ind	There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
tr	Ind	Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .
tr	Ind	There was certainly more despair in Saddam ' s Iraq than in Paul Bremmer ' s Iraq , and no one exploded himself .
tr	Ind	A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
tr	Ind	"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
tr	Ind	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Ind	If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
tr	Ind	The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
tr	Ind	Russia is beginning to understand it .
tr	Ind	Turkey understands it well .
tr	Ind	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Ind	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
tr	Ind	The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
tr	Ind	Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .
tr	Ind	* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies .*
tr	Ind	They kill people .
tr	Ind	It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
tr	Ind	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
tr	Ind	An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
tr	Ind	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Ind	Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
tr	Ind	Mr . Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
tr	Ind	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Ind	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Ind	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
tr	Ind	But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
tr	Ind	When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
tr	Ind	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Ind	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Ind	Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
tr	Ind	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
tr	Ind	I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
tr	Ind	"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam ' s regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration ""."
tr	Ind	You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
tr	Ind	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid - day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
tr	Ind	She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
tr	Ind	"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and "" activist "" by the European press ."
tr	Ind	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
tr	Ind	"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "", the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader ""."
tr	Ind	There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
tr	Ind	These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
tr	Ind	They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
tr	Ind	It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
tr	Ind	He is now being outperformed by his successors .
tr	Ind	* 3 . The third aspect is money .*
tr	Ind	Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
tr	Ind	In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
tr	Ind	The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
tr	Ind	The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
tr	Ind	These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
tr	Ind	They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
tr	Ind	Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
tr	Ind	This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
tr	Ind	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Ind	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Ind	The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO ' s and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
tr	Ind	The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
tr	Ind	Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
tr	Ind	Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
tr	Ind	The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
tr	Ind	Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
tr	Ind	Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
tr	Ind	You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
tr	Ind	"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
tr	Ind	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Ind	* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws .*
tr	Ind	The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
tr	Ind	There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
tr	Ind	Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
tr	Ind	Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti - democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
tr	Ind	"Does free speech protect you when you shout "" fire "" in a crowded theater ?"
tr	Ind	These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
tr	Ind	But now we have an entire new set .
tr	Ind	Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
tr	Ind	Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
tr	Ind	Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
tr	Ind	Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
tr	Ind	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Ind	Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
tr	Ind	Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
tr	Ind	Do you shoot an arch - murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
tr	Ind	All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
tr	Ind	What do you do ?
tr	Ind	Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
tr	Ind	I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
tr	Ind	The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
tr	Ind	It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
tr	Ind	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Ind	International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
tr	Ind	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Ind	"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as "" war criminals ,"" with some Western media repeating the allegations ."
tr	Ind	The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
tr	Ind	After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
tr	Ind	The picture I described here is not pretty .
tr	Ind	Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter - propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
tr	Ind	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Ind	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Ind	If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
tr	Ind	But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
tr	Ind	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Ind	I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre - war argument , but I can look at the post - war map of Western Asia .
tr	Ind	Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
tr	Ind	As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
tr	Ind	Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
tr	Ind	Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
tr	Ind	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Ind	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Ind	I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
tr	Ind	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Ind	It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
tr	Ind	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Ind	It is ruthless .
tr	Ind	It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
tr	Ind	It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
tr	Ind	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Ind	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Ind	Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
tr	Ind	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Ind	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Ind	When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
tr	Ind	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Ind	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Ind	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Ind	But it really does not matter .
tr	Ind	What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
tr	Ind	The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
tr	Ind	Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
tr	Ind	If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
tr	Ind	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Ind	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Ind	It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
tr	Ind	On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
tr	Ind	I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
tr	Ind	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Ind	Europe , more than any other region , is the key .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Ind	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Ind	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Ind	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Ind	"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ("" CIA "") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax ."
tr	Ind	"An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "" unbelievable "" biological attack , the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("" KSM "")."
tr	Ind	He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
tr	Ind	In November 2003 , a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties .
tr	Ind	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Ind	"According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda ’ s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face ."""
tr	Ind	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Ind	Photographs from a seized computer disc included the controls and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot .
tr	Ind	In a bulletin , the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon .
tr	Ind	The CIA reportedly has been quietly building a case that the anthrax mailings were an international plot .
tr	Ind	This is old news .
tr	Ind	It ' s just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI ' s ( former ) theory about a lone , American scientist .
tr	Ind	Many people have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the mailings served as a threat and warning .
tr	Ind	Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis has explained that while islamists may disagree about whether killing innocents is sanctioned by the laws of jihad , extremists like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used .
tr	Ind	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Ind	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
tr	Ind	Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 , included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise .
tr	Ind	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Ind	The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities .
tr	Ind	Mabruk , at the time , was the head of Jihad ' s military operations .
tr	Ind	There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development .
tr	Ind	Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9 / 11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
tr	Ind	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Ind	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Ind	"In March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9 / 11 but was to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Ind	Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $ 14 , 000 in July , accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks .
tr	Ind	KSM explained that Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US - trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative , Malaysian Yazid Sufaat .
tr	Ind	"Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable , has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "" anthrax for Jew sympathizer only ."""
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda ' s regional operative , Hambali , who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat , has been captured .
tr	Ind	Hambali reportedly is cooperating to some degree .
tr	Ind	KSM and Hambali sent al - Hindi ( al - Britani ), along with Jafar the Pilot , to case NYC targets for a second wave .
tr	Ind	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Ind	Sufaat , according to both KSM and Hambali , did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used .
tr	Ind	That would require someone who had access to the strain .
tr	Ind	But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri ' s decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter .
tr	Ind	The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years .
tr	Ind	Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
tr	Ind	He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader .
tr	Ind	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Ind	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Ind	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Ind	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Ind	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Ind	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Ind	"A few days before Christmas 2003 , after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks , to include in the US homeland , the threat level was raised to orange or "" high ."""
tr	Ind	After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow , Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape .
tr	Ind	He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9 / 11 on US soil .
tr	Ind	According to some reports , Zawahiri is thought by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	At one time , some thought he had been spotted in Iran .
tr	Ind	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Ind	"In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop ( from 1995 ) that was signed "" Khalid Sheik Bojinka ""?"
tr	Ind	The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released .
tr	Ind	( Khalid Mohammed ' s involvement dates back to Bojinka , as does Hambali ' s ).
tr	Ind	Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
tr	Ind	In May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9 / 11 Commission .
tr	Ind	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Ind	The same week , the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes , they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received .
tr	Ind	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Ind	Zawahiri , Al Qaeda ' s # 2 , is head of Al Qaeda ' s biochemical program .
tr	Ind	The CIA has known of Zawahiri ' s plans to use anthrax for a half decade .
tr	Ind	The confidante and right - hand man of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets .
tr	Ind	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Ind	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Ind	A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
tr	Ind	The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts .
tr	Ind	There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 .
tr	Ind	Significantly , the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ), upon being contacted , does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft . Detrick .
tr	Ind	Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources .
tr	Ind	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed ' s computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons .
tr	Ind	At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek , under the optimal method , there is no electrostatic charge .
tr	Ind	In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings , there was an electrostatic charge .
tr	Ind	Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns .
tr	Ind	Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
tr	Ind	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Ind	"The "" trillion spore "" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
tr	Ind	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Ind	USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , in sensational detail , of Atta ' s inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster .
tr	Ind	Khalid Mohammed then told interrogators that Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusting may have related to Yazid Sufaat ' s anthrax manufacturing plans .
tr	Ind	Although the details of the documents on Mohammed ' s computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings .
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda had both the means and opportunity .
tr	Ind	US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9 / 11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 .
tr	Ind	"Sufaat was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ("" JI "")."
tr	Ind	JI has ties with the Moro Front .
tr	Ind	Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda .
tr	Ind	"( Green symbolizes "" Islam "" and Prophet Mohammed ' s holy war )."
tr	Ind	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Ind	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Ind	"The crop dusters were to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Ind	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Ind	The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax .
tr	Ind	Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
tr	Ind	"Newsweek reported that a "" second wave "" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support ."
tr	Ind	Various doctors , both foreign and American , are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives , to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan , a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui , PhD , from Karachi .
tr	Ind	Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the fugitives .
tr	Ind	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Ind	Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning .
tr	Ind	It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui , who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology .
tr	Ind	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Ind	If mistaken , how did those reports first come about ?
tr	Ind	Understandably , Amerithrax is a confidential investigation .
tr	Ind	The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt .
tr	Ind	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Ind	As agent Van Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation said , the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information .
tr	Ind	While it ' s not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought .
tr	Ind	Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March .
tr	Ind	Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad .
tr	Ind	According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative ' s house ).
tr	Ind	( Karachi is in the south ).
tr	Ind	"The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda ' s "" Chemical Wire Group ."""
tr	Ind	The family ' s lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station .
tr	Ind	That was the last Ismat heard from her .
tr	Ind	Aafia never reached the uncle ' s house .
tr	Ind	"Perhaps something got lost in the translation , but the phrase "" Chemical Wire Group "" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers ."
tr	Ind	The family ' s attorney advises me that Aafia had no knowledge of chemicals ( and that would not appear to be her training ).
tr	Ind	"There still is a very hot pursuit of the "" Atta - level "" Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting ."
tr	Ind	"His nickname is "" Jafar the Pilot ."""
tr	Ind	A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot .
tr	Ind	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Ind	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Ind	He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also has received pilot training .
tr	Ind	The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically - based preconceptions .
tr	Ind	In early June 2003 , a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax .
tr	Ind	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Ind	The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program at Kandahar .
tr	Ind	The present evidence relating to Atta ' s alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq .
tr	Ind	Iraq , however , remains a possible source of the Ames .
tr	Ind	Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain .
tr	Ind	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Ind	Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam ' s son .
tr	Ind	The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq ' s secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
tr	Ind	According to at least some reports , Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad .
tr	Ind	Two top Iraqi scientists , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi ' s anthrax program , according to Dr . David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
tr	Ind	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Ind	"The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "" liberals ."""
tr	Ind	"Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "" Leahy Law "" to military and security forces ."
tr	Ind	That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals .
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI ' s involvement in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries .
tr	Ind	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Ind	Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries .
tr	Ind	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Ind	This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remains foremost in the mind of Dr . Zawahiri .
tr	Ind	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Ind	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Ind	Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq .
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda had a motive in mind .
tr	Ind	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Ind	Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
tr	Ind	The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention .
tr	Ind	"Most of the "" talking heads "" on television , however , knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers ."
tr	Ind	The FBI ' s profile includes a US - based supporter of the militant islamists .
tr	Ind	"Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "" either - or "" approach is not useful ."
tr	Ind	"The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "" domestic "" the word includes a US - based , highly - educated supporter of the militant islamists ."
tr	Ind	There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage .
tr	Ind	A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the conclusion that there were not one , but two , such mailings containing anthrax .
tr	Ind	( The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun ).
tr	Ind	( News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun .)
tr	Ind	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Ind	The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D . C ..
tr	Ind	They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman .
tr	Ind	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Ind	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
tr	Ind	The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message .
tr	Ind	( There initially was an outstanding $ 2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program , the reward now is up to $ 5 million .).
tr	Ind	There was no claim of responsibility .
tr	Ind	There was no explanation .
tr	Ind	Once one had been received , the next ten , mailed on two separate dates , were easily collected .
tr	Ind	"Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned , addressed to "" Parole Officer ."""
tr	Ind	( The position does not exist ).
tr	Ind	Abdel Rahman ' s son was captured in Quetta , Pakistan in mid - February 2003 .
tr	Ind	That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 .
tr	Ind	Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr . Abdul Qadoos Khan .
tr	Ind	Along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden .
tr	Ind	He reportedly treated them like sons .
tr	Ind	Although while in jail in the early 1980s , Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik ' s ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group , Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman ' s friends .
tr	Ind	The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM ' s nephew .
tr	Ind	Thus , the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center .
tr	Ind	"According to the controversial "" Feith memo ,"" which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi / Al Qaeda connection , Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent ."
tr	Ind	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Ind	"As Brian Jenkins once said , "" terrorism is theater ."""
tr	Ind	A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
tr	Ind	"There ' s even a chapter titled "" Poisonous Letter "" in the Al Qaeda manual ."
tr	Ind	"The "" Federal Eagle "" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue - green ."
tr	Ind	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""
tr	Ind	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Ind	"Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "" The 19 Martyrs ."""
tr	Ind	"A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "" In the Hearts of Green Birds "" refers to what is inside ."
tr	Ind	"The mailer ' s use of "" Greendale School "" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing ."
tr	Ind	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Ind	Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed ' s color .
tr	Ind	By Greendale School , the anthrax perp was being cute , just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
tr	Ind	""" Dale "" means "" river valley ."""
tr	Ind	Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i . e ., Cairo ' s Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group .
tr	Ind	The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
tr	Ind	At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained , recruits would wear green uniforms , except for Friday when they were washed .
tr	Ind	In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise .
tr	Ind	"As to opportunity , though seldom reported , there is a wealth of "" open source "" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada ."
tr	Ind	The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri ' s mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes .
tr	Ind	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Ind	What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet ?
tr	Ind	Whatever your political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve our support .
tr	Ind	We are , after all , in this together .
tr	Ind	First , the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI is doing .
tr	Ind	Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources .
tr	Ind	Second , hindsight is 20 / 20 .
tr	Ind	"Third , with the "" new age "" Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . in charge of the investigation , it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security ."
tr	Ind	"Finally , the "" Hatfill theory "" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor ."
tr	Ind	"The "" Hatfill theory "" accusing Dr . Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious ."
tr	Ind	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .
tr	Ind	The FBI ' s fixation on Hatfill ( at least as rumored by some reporters ) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance .
tr	Ind	Leahy ' s chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right - winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted .
tr	Ind	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
tr	Ind	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
tr	Ind	The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
tr	Ind	The judge , frustrated by the apparent lack of progress , encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed ( and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint ).
tr	Ind	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Ind	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him .
tr	Ind	Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets ( August Board meeting ) one more time before I forward it to you .
tr	Ind	He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc .) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
tr	Ind	Typically , we receive both FX and inflation from you , but both curves may not always be used .
tr	Ind	I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests .
tr	Ind	For now , this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and / or inflation curves .
tr	Ind	Puerto Rico CPI only ( I need historical inflation data , as well )
tr	Ind	Brazil we have current data already
tr	Ind	China we have current data already
tr	Ind	I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting / IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already .
tr	Ind	I have to decline the invitation with regrets .
tr	Ind	I have too many commitments right now .
tr	Ind	Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress , Risk 2001 Australia , which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001 .
tr	Ind	Have you had an opportunity to consider the invitation yet ?
tr	Ind	We are aiming to have the programme printed next week , so I would really need to know as soon as possible if you would be available to speak at this year ' s congress .
tr	Ind	I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only ( Tel : + 852 2545 2710 ), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email .
tr	Ind	Beth has made our reservations for the Round Table Friday night ( 5 / 18 ) at Sullivan ' s Steak House for 6 : 30 .
tr	Ind	Beth has made our reservations for the Round Table Friday night ( 5 / 18 ) at Sullivan ' s Steak House for 6 : 30 .
tr	Ind	As I mentioned in my voice mail , Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody , a recent MBA grad from Rice , into his group .
tr	Ind	However , when we were talking about this position , Mike compared Sara to Elena .
tr	Ind	Elena ' s title is admin coordinator , and I know that Sara should not have this title , and honestly do not think that Elena should also .
tr	Ind	Admin coordinator ' s do primarily administrative work .
tr	Ind	I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah ' s duties / level to other Sr . Spec . in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent , or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad .
tr	Ind	If the latter is the case , we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33 - 66K ).
tr	Ind	I appreciate all your help .
tr	Ind	Martin ' s box is working wonderfully - I ' ll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday .
tr	Ind	This was ( another ) nice deal for Enron .
tr	Ind	We save $ 21 , 000 in real money this way , the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server , using a box that wasn ' t being used by anyone .
tr	Ind	I ' m happy about this .
tr	Ind	I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don ' t have access to now .
tr	Ind	Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund , telling me to invest in Home Depot , Sun , and Coke , or trying to pass off their banks ' biased research reports as something valuable .
tr	Ind	The above services provide no value to me personally .
tr	Ind	At some point , I ' d like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close ?
tr	Ind	Appreciate the idea .
tr	Ind	However , with my natural long , I ' m not looking to really trade around the position .
tr	Ind	I believe ENE will continue to be range bound , but in case it is not , I don ' t want to forgo 50 % of my option premium .
tr	Ind	I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy .
tr	Ind	To that regards , I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls .
tr	Ind	I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options .
tr	Ind	I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold .
tr	Ind	Of course , you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce .
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place , but maybe @ 73 .

tr	Ind	Your buddy Beau invited me .
tr	Ind	already have plans on thursday .

tr	Ind	already have plans on thursday .
tr	Ind	are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday ?
tr	Ind	oh god is there an agenda .
tr	Ind	Wednesday doesn ' t work for me .
tr	Ind	i completely agree .
tr	Ind	I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1 - 2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything .
tr	Ind	My only concern is that we take the boys away from their overwhelming task .
tr	Ind	What do you guys think .

tr	Ind	What do you guys think .
tr	Ind	Did you happen to sign your employment agreement ?
tr	Ind	John Lavorato has requested the attached report .
tr	Ind	He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories - in particular , Real Time Traders .
tr	Ind	I ' m at xif you have any questions .
tr	Ind	I understand all of those comparisons , however , the reality is if we lose Dean ( which we will if we don ' t pay 65k + 10k ), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75 - 80k .
tr	Ind	This is pretty easy math for me .
tr	Ind	I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
tr	Ind	I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent .
tr	Ind	Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following :
tr	Ind	Business Case : If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $ 10 , 000 increase ( approximately 25 %) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
tr	Ind	Also , the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66k .
tr	Ind	Secondly , he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg . Paul Thomas , Jason Choate , Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai .
tr	Ind	Are we going to attend ?
tr	Ind	The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system .
tr	Ind	I need to check something in 969 ' s 2000 tax return .
tr	Ind	Who has the 2000 tax return file for 969 ?
tr	Ind	I think that this is for you since I don ' t know any of these people .
tr	Ind	WHY : Today is John ' s last day at EBS .
tr	Ind	This is NOT an Enron - sponsored event .
tr	Ind	How do you feel about taking on another company ?
tr	Ind	Essie and Leon have proposed xferring Co . 1691 to your world ( see below ).
tr	Ind	Do you concur ?
tr	Ind	If you have not already made these decisions , Essie ' s guidance should be helpful .
tr	Ind	Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization ?
tr	Ind	I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group .
tr	Ind	This entity is not in TIS , SAP , nor Hyperion .
tr	Ind	The 2000 tax return has no income , assets , or liabilities .
tr	Ind	There is a corporate data sheet for this company , but this entity seems to have been inactive since it ' s creation .
tr	Ind	Despite the name , this entity appears to be a MTM company .
tr	Ind	Per September financials , this company has about $ 3M of MTM and about $ 8K of expenses , nothing else .
tr	Ind	The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS , and did not get assigned during the reorg .
tr	Ind	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications ( now Enron WarpSpeed Services , Inc . 83N ), and then dissolved upon completion of merger .
tr	Ind	Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities , but no I / S items .
tr	Ind	83N is my responsibility .
tr	Ind	I think this entity should stay with 83N .
tr	Ind	So I suggest it be assigned to Leon .
tr	Ind	I think this could go to either Holding / Administrative Companies ( Same as 17H ) or Network & Services ( Leon ).
tr	Ind	Broke out the activities of 1179 .
tr	Ind	A similar entity ( 1179 ) was assigned to Commodity and Trade ( Todd Richards and Mary Fischer ) so this one should be assigned to them as well .
tr	Ind	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a CFC .
tr	Ind	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ).
tr	Ind	Broke out the activities of 1307 .
tr	Ind	I see that it is a 4 , so that will be no problem .
tr	Ind	How do you feel about taking on another company ?
tr	Ind	Essie and Leon have proposed xferring Co . 1691 to your world ( see below ).

tr	Ind	I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .
tr	Ind	I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
tr	Ind	They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection .
tr	Ind	By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent .
tr	Ind	I have also purchased an Appel in the last month .
tr	Ind	I am interested in several artists .
tr	Ind	My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like .
tr	Ind	I listed all of our ( sometimes mine vs . my wife ' s favorites and priorities ).
tr	Ind	They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
tr	Ind	I want signed and numbered .
tr	Ind	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
tr	Ind	I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive .
tr	Ind	For example , I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper .
tr	Ind	At least that is what I am thinking now .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know that he did any )
tr	Ind	By the way , I am interested in re - looking at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that your gallery had a couple of years ago .
tr	Ind	"It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling )."
tr	Ind	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20 , 000 .
tr	Ind	Is there 1 available ?
tr	Ind	Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .
tr	Ind	Huskers drool over Sooners .
tr	Ind	Huskers rule , Sooners drool .
tr	Ind	Sooners rule .
tr	Ind	We ' ll find time when things settle down .
tr	Ind	I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today .
tr	Ind	I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch .
tr	Ind	Actually , I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don ' t be too mad if I have to cancel .
tr	Ind	PS Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games ( when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture . com bowl and that one in Shreveport ( I can ' t remember the name of it )) I realized he is a very , very sick college football fan .
tr	Ind	Jeff , here is the intial draft .
tr	Ind	I haven ' t even changed the wording after I first put it down .
tr	Ind	Mark , I thought you would enjoy the comment about you .

tr	Ind	I can recommend some good restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday .
tr	Ind	We stayed at the Menger and had a great time .
tr	Ind	This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at St . Francis , which may be his new school ( so far , so good ).
tr	Ind	Most Fridays I ' m going to TRY to pick Michael up since I ' m away so much , which means leaving by 445 or so .
tr	Ind	October 19 / 20 , Neil is out of town , so I have to pick Michael up from school ( leave at 430 )
tr	Ind	October 26 / 27 , hope to be vacation time .
tr	Ind	Neil has a meeting in San Antonio ( usually it is in Miami , San Francisco , Phoenix - not so great this year ).
tr	Ind	It is the officer ' s meeting for Enterprise , and spouses are invited .
tr	Ind	This means we won ' t be in town for the Compaq thing .
tr	Ind	Figures , of course .
tr	Ind	I ' m watching for some good vacation days , also ...
tr	Ind	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
tr	Ind	We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
tr	Ind	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
tr	Ind	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what ' s in the draft ?
tr	Ind	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
tr	Ind	Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract , or several ?
tr	Ind	I ' m looking for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart ' s files ( haven ' t checked closely yet ).
tr	Ind	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
tr	Ind	I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project .

tr	Ind	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
tr	Ind	On the issue of the contracts , the draft says that the $ 170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed .
tr	Ind	Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed ?
tr	Ind	1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i . e ., ONSI would be a lot more money ).
tr	Ind	Hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
tr	Ind	2 . The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .
tr	Ind	In my opinion , we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached .
tr	Ind	Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
tr	Ind	3 . I expect at least one EPC contract per project .
tr	Ind	We don ' t want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project .
tr	Ind	Mom ' s birthday is tommorow .
tr	Ind	What are we going to get her ?
tr	Ind	That is some good stuff .
tr	Ind	I hear you are coming our way soon .
tr	Ind	Look forward to drinking a few beers .
tr	Ind	Yo Mama ` s so fat ....
tr	Ind	Your mama is so fat : When she hauls ass she has to make two trips .

tr	Ind	She puts mayonnaise on aspirin . (<- clearly the winner )
tr	Ind	Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard .
tr	Ind	When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts .
tr	Ind	Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph .
tr	Ind	"Her driver ` s license says "" Picture continued on other side ."""
tr	Ind	She has to iron her pants on the driveway .
tr	Ind	The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs .
tr	Ind	"Yo mama ` s so fat , all the restaurants in town have signs that say : "" Maximum Occupancy : 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama "" Yo mama ` s so fat , when she ran away , they had to use all four sides of the milk carton ."
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , instead of Levis 501 jeans , she wears Levi ` s 1002 ` s .
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , when she gets in an elevator , it HAS to go down .
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth .
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , she ` s got smaller fat women orbiting around her .
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , she could sell shade .
tr	Ind	What are some good interview questions ?
tr	Ind	I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn ' t want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis .
tr	Ind	I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say .
tr	Ind	He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality .
tr	Ind	Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive ?
tr	Ind	All the guys at work are saying I shouldn ' t bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one .
tr	Ind	Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that ?
tr	Ind	I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book ( I only wrote it in my red book ).
tr	Ind	Paul called me today .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t get a chance to talk to Paul today .
tr	Ind	I am in the office so give me a call .
tr	Ind	The deed is done .
tr	Ind	Hopefully he didn ' t spel anyting incorrectly .
tr	Ind	Dan is really smart and a hard worker .
tr	Ind	I think he would be a good fit .
tr	Ind	I haven ' t had a chance to send it yet .
tr	Ind	Paul is out of the office today so I haven ' t had a chance to talk to him .
tr	Ind	I ' ll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not .
tr	Ind	Are you guys still looking for an analyst ?
tr	Ind	Attached is a forecast for the rest of the summer for the X ( NWP and PGT ).
tr	Ind	Ryan Watt says high .
tr	Ind	Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle ' s help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
tr	Ind	We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
tr	Ind	Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
tr	Ind	Late Jan sounds great .
tr	Ind	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation ( big dance that she and I are committed to help with ), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion .
tr	Ind	I believe that these are three weekends in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th .
tr	Ind	Does that work for you ?
tr	Ind	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
tr	Ind	Saturday probably works better for me , just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon !!
tr	Ind	Talked to the little mother - to - be .
tr	Ind	She said a shower would be grand .
tr	Ind	She has some big presentation mid - January .
tr	Ind	How does late January sound to you .
tr	Ind	Am I turning into Mother ?
tr	Ind	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Ind	On the means of delivery , I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent .
tr	Ind	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John ' s name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent )?
tr	Ind	Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ?
tr	Ind	With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .
tr	Ind	With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .
tr	Ind	I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .
tr	Ind	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent ' s return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .
tr	Ind	I don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .
tr	Ind	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .
tr	Ind	There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report .
tr	Ind	Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this , and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New .
tr	Ind	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against .
tr	Ind	Sorry that this response looks so long .
tr	Ind	I have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so I hope that it makes sense .
tr	Ind	Since you asked for input , I hope that you don ' t mind that I gave you some .
tr	Ind	Steve , I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21 % year on year ( ie ) $ 13 . 9M from $ 11 . 5M .
tr	Ind	We have been able to keep ENA ' s direct group expenses flat year on year , we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
tr	Ind	Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
tr	Ind	I just wanted Sue to hear ( she enjoys utility bashing so much ).
tr	Ind	In some respects I don ' t think the first panel could have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for different reasons ).
tr	Ind	The other staff reports are also looking good .
tr	Ind	Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is .
tr	Ind	I apologize if I offended anyone .
tr	Ind	You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
tr	Ind	Does she have any interest in meeting one - on - one or is she just looking for a public hanging ?
tr	Ind	I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach .
tr	Ind	Given the short notice , we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday , but will let the good Senator know that , in general , we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody .
tr	Ind	At this point , our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems .
tr	Ind	There are still four important issues , however :
tr	Ind	This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
tr	Ind	No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
tr	Ind	WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
tr	Ind	HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .
tr	Ind	Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
tr	Ind	Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e - mail ).
tr	Ind	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Ind	The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
tr	Ind	They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .
tr	Ind	Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we can ' t and where they are ?
tr	Ind	Are whole offices ( eg Tokyo ) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices ?
tr	Ind	Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning BackWeb before we proceed .
tr	Ind	As you can see from the Design Document , they are pretty significant .
tr	Ind	Paul Kaufman has asked me to set a conference call to review the FERC Meeting that was held Thursday , Nov . 9th .
tr	Ind	it ' s on tonight
tr	Ind	it ' s did you watch your girl on tv last night ?

tr	Ind	Did you do a deal with National Fuel Marketing purchasing 3 , 500 mmbtu on May 30th @ 2 . 975 ?
tr	Ind	They are invoicing for this and I don ' t have an invoice for it .
tr	Ind	I was issued a new corporate American Express card .
tr	Ind	Thank you .

tr	Ind	Jane , on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas , we have a pricing discrepancy .

tr	Ind	Our last call was Iris Kind , Bill Savier ( sp ?), and Jeff Davis .
tr	Ind	I ' m still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement .
tr	Ind	Steve , everything looks good with one exception .

tr	Ind	By the way , Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray .
tr	Ind	This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark - up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago .

tr	Ind	Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War .
tr	Ind	She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands .
tr	Ind	She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives .
tr	Ind	"Ms . Walters approached one of the women and said , "" This is marvelous ."
tr	Ind	"Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles ?"""
tr	Ind	""" Land mines ,"" said the Kuwaiti woman ."
tr	Ind	Cullen and Dykman ( attorneys for Boston Gas Company ) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas .

tr	Ind	Jack welch is the CEO of GE , not GM .
tr	Ind	"We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "" wish list "" for us ."
tr	Ind	The response was tremendous and , in some cases , very creative .
tr	Ind	Your fellow employees asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush .
tr	Ind	In all , we received requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event .
tr	Ind	We thought you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting , so we ' ve provided a sampling of the suggestions below .
tr	Ind	Here are the top ten most requested eSpeakers .
tr	Ind	Everybody needs a little help now and then , even eSpeak .
tr	Ind	There were plenty of internal speakers requested , as well .

tr	Ind	July 12 , 2 : 30 it is .
tr	Ind	We ' re all set for 2 : 30 on July 12 .
tr	Ind	I shall invite some people who work on electricity in my group to join me .
tr	Ind	Good to hear from you and I ' m glad you ' re available .
tr	Ind	How is Wednesday at 2 : 30 ?
tr	Ind	I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality .
tr	Ind	I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures .
tr	Ind	How is the site doing ?
tr	Ind	I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman , Morgan , BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours .
tr	Ind	If we have time next week , I could step you through our website -- www . weathereffects . com .
tr	Ind	I ' m very proud of what we ' ve done .
tr	Ind	It ' s a very ambitious site -- with state - of - the - art WSI weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL .
tr	Ind	"ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts , capacity judgments , and "" herding "" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods ."
tr	Ind	After one month ' s full - bore effort , I ' m pleased with the results ( e . g ., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ).
tr	Ind	Have a great weekend .
tr	Ind	P . S . By the way , did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL ?
tr	Ind	what do you think ?
tr	Ind	Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold .
tr	Ind	If possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .
tr	Ind	The line in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral .
tr	Ind	The 20 mill reflects gross exposure .
tr	Ind	We too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us .
tr	Ind	I am going to find out how much line we currently have available ... you probably already have this .
tr	Ind	I think this would solve our main concern ...
tr	Ind	I am hopeful that we are ready to prepare execution copies .
tr	Ind	Attached for your review is a blacklined version of the : ( a ) Schedule and ( b ) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Master Agreement .

tr	Ind	Hope you enjoyed your weekend in Houston .
tr	Ind	looks fine
tr	Ind	We need to change the Prod Description fro the LME Product .
tr	Ind	"The change is mainly on the Settlement Date text , which instead of ""... Two business days after the date of the Transaction ..."" shall read as follow :"

tr	Ind	The price is quoted in JPY ( the ' Foreign Currency ') per US Dollar ( the ' Base Currency ').
tr	Ind	The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be US Dollars .

tr	Ind	The ones that I made changes to are in red .
tr	Ind	I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet .

tr	Ind	I do not think the prior e - mail got through to Kay .
tr	Ind	Are either of you familiar with this project ?
tr	Ind	We have had no contact with the ENA / Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don ' t want to bust any structuring goals .
tr	Ind	Our project manager ( Scott Laidlaw ) and engineer ( Harry Okabayashi ) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work .
tr	Ind	I now understand that someone at ENA / Enron Mexico / Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC contract with ABB for this project .
tr	Ind	I am not in the office today , so please include Renee Alfaro on your response .
tr	Ind	I enjoyed your recent e - mail but was sorry to hear about your dad .
tr	Ind	It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly .
tr	Ind	These are always difficult times .
tr	Ind	As I watched my mother and father ' s health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die , it is a very defining time in our lives .
tr	Ind	Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU .
tr	Ind	He is joining an excellent company .
tr	Ind	I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA .
tr	Ind	As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable , it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can .
tr	Ind	As to our family , within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires , Argentina .
tr	Ind	They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires .
tr	Ind	They ' re currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami , Florida .
tr	Ind	This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born .
tr	Ind	It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney .
tr	Ind	It was a 7 lb ., 10 oz ., 20 inch little boy .
tr	Ind	So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
tr	Ind	They are a great deal of fun .
tr	Ind	We are doing quite well .

tr	Ind	Thank you for your recent request for Mr . Lay to speak at your conference .
tr	Ind	Thank you again ,
tr	Ind	Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work .
tr	Ind	I want to check with Mr . Lay before confirming .
tr	Ind	As you know , our next meeting is on Wednesday , July 12 from 3 : 00 - 5 : 30 p . m .
tr	Ind	In the next week or so , we ' ll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues , and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it .
tr	Ind	Meanwhile , Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to brainstorm on the ideas we ' ve generated and also to give us a sense of some of the issues as he sees them .
tr	Ind	There are three possible dates for the meeting , which I suggest be in two parts -- first , a meeting among the panel only from 5 : 00 - 6 : 30 p . m ., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6 : 30 - 8 : 30 p . m .
tr	Ind	Here are the dates :
tr	Ind	Ken said to go ahead and equip it with what you think it should have .
tr	Ind	Here is the link to the latest commercial laptops on the market , I will follow up with the consumer models .
tr	Ind	The M300 series are the lightest and the E500 ' s are the all in one but much heavier .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , Mr . Lay will be in San Jose , CA participating in a conference , where he is a speaker , on June 14 .
tr	Ind	Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation to a reception which they are hosting on Wed . 6 / 14 at 5 : 00 PM to be held at the Houston Petroleum Club .
tr	Ind	I hope that you will be able to attend that event .
tr	Ind	Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress in Education in Texas over the past decade .?
tr	Ind	Now it is time to take the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education system .
tr	Ind	The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders , educators , and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to improving education in Texas .
tr	Ind	This is o . k . for Ken Lay , but we are changing to a more uniform address , so would likely be better to use kenneth . lay @ enron . com .

tr	Ind	Kenneth Lay has approved the attached expense report for Cindy Olson .
tr	Ind	I believe someone called about this today , but Mr . Lay asked me to let you know that these dates don ' t work for him , either .
tr	Ind	Could you tell me what deal tickets you are seeing ?
tr	Ind	Sitara isn ' t matching the spreadsheet .
tr	Ind	Actually it is not a new truck .
tr	Ind	Had 33 , 000 miles , Ram 2500 3 / 4 ton , 4 x 4 , 360 Magnum Motor .
tr	Ind	Oh , it is dueled out through one catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound .
tr	Ind	Makes me want to race !!!
tr	Ind	I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well .
tr	Ind	Now , Debbie wants it .
tr	Ind	I gave $ 16 , 900 + tax .
tr	Ind	It is very clean and is Sandalwood , Driftwood or something of that nature in color .
tr	Ind	I have to pick up old gray over at Jerry ' s .
tr	Ind	Debbie said , it is going to be hard on me to sale my old dodge truck .
tr	Ind	I said Yep , had that truck longer than I have had most of my women .
tr	Ind	I really need to engage brain before articulating !
tr	Ind	I am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before rain .
tr	Ind	One thing is for sure , the economy is not faltering on my account .
tr	Ind	Dow Stock is back up over $ 33 .
tr	Ind	Needs to go to $ 41 and then I will be happy .
tr	Ind	I spoke with Gerald and he said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad ' s place .
tr	Ind	We need to change the lock and place posted signs at the gate .
tr	Ind	I am going up soon and having the tractor fixed .
tr	Ind	Reggie said he will pay us soon .
tr	Ind	He also still wants the tractor if we can hold on to it .
tr	Ind	When is the wedding ?
tr	Ind	We ' re set for 11 / 01 / 01 .
tr	Ind	It was sure beautiful coming up last night .
tr	Ind	We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket and watch for the space shuttle .
tr	Ind	I had a couple of hickies on my neck the day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns .
tr	Ind	My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate within the four year period .
tr	Ind	She still has some sort of scholarship but I am not for sure how much it pays .
tr	Ind	She is going to be a kinesiologist , sports injury therapist .
tr	Ind	I think she just wants to be able to touch football players legs .
tr	Ind	I am really proud of her .
tr	Ind	Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much .
tr	Ind	I am sure she would like to hear from you .
tr	Ind	You should have listened to Maw , as long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped , you will be alright .
tr	Ind	Shucks , guess none of us three paid much attention to that .
tr	Ind	Oh , Jeff Sherrar has a new book out .
tr	Ind	There were some pretty cool dudes back around 1774 / 76 .
tr	Ind	I am half way through the first and you can borrow it when I am through .
tr	Ind	I sure like his style of writing .
tr	Ind	His books are always hard to put down .
tr	Ind	After the split Dow Stock there are 120 shares .
tr	Ind	What ' s happening ?
tr	Ind	I understand you have a brand new truck .
tr	Ind	I need 2 things from you .
tr	Ind	1 . I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to change it over to you name .
tr	Ind	What do you think ?
tr	Ind	If that ' s ok , how do you want your name to show up on the title and what address should I use ?
tr	Ind	2 . I ' m getting ready to divy up the Dow stock .
tr	Ind	How many of Dad ' s shares do you have ?
tr	Ind	I thought we only had cashout , at most 3 times , before this June .
tr	Ind	I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year .
tr	Ind	I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico .
tr	Ind	Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months ?
tr	Ind	Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month .
tr	Ind	I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced .
tr	Ind	I ' m checking my emails .
tr	Ind	I assume you have your anwser and don ' t need me .
tr	Ind	I sent this to Mary last week .
tr	Ind	She may be out because in the past she always responds pretty quick .
tr	Ind	I need the prices below .
tr	Ind	I need your help again .
tr	Ind	I need prices for May , June , and July .
tr	Ind	In light of the CA regarding curves , I am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples unlimited access to information .
tr	Ind	I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have .
tr	Ind	Our attorneys and internal audit area have made one language revision concerning Section XIII Audit Rights .
tr	Ind	I ' m still at home .
tr	Ind	I have a fax machine at home , though , if you prefer .
tr	Ind	Which do you prefer ?
tr	Ind	Are you in the office to initial signature pages today ?
tr	Ind	If not , is there someone else that will ?
tr	Ind	I know that Jeff is in Portland .
tr	Ind	If Jeff is happy , I ' m happy .
tr	Ind	I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights .
tr	Ind	His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L . L . C .
tr	Ind	However , he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron ' s interests .
tr	Ind	1 ) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2 ) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement .
tr	Ind	This language has been included in the attached draft .
tr	Ind	My goal , however optimistic , is to execute the risk policy by the end of today .
tr	Ind	Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day .
tr	Ind	Therefore , I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written .

tr	Ind	Our attorneys and internal audit area have made one language revision concerning Section XIII Audit Rights .
tr	Ind	It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn ' t know anything about it and get them to initial it .
tr	Ind	I can print it here , initial it , and fax it to whomever you want .
tr	Ind	Plus , I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that , instead of having a lawyer she hasn ' t dealt with initial it .
tr	Ind	She is very conscientious about what she signs , and who initials what .
tr	Ind	Is the attached form the final final form ?
tr	Ind	Where and to whom do you want it faxed ?
tr	Ind	Either fax or someone else works fine .
tr	Ind	I ' m still at home .

tr	Ind	I ' m working on it now .
tr	Ind	Does that work ?
tr	Ind	It was good to hear from you !
tr	Ind	We had a nice Thanksgiving here too .
tr	Ind	It ' s funny , because usually it ' s just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia doesn ' t really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me !), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
tr	Ind	It was good having the girls down .
tr	Ind	"We played a new version of Uno called "" African Uno "" that was complex , fast and at times , physically challenging ."
tr	Ind	It ' s not for the meek .
tr	Ind	It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
tr	Ind	She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses ( when you play you ' ll see why you can know everyone elses hands !).
tr	Ind	I expect Craig didn ' t want Mom to see his place because it was messy .
tr	Ind	I think compared to my house , he ' s embarrased about his apartment .
tr	Ind	Then , also , he ' s got so much stuff in there right now , that I don ' t know how he ' s going to fit baby stuff .
tr	Ind	They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don ' t want 3 people in that small apartment .
tr	Ind	So he ' s going to have to start looking for another place .
tr	Ind	And his apartment is so run down down I ' m afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby .
tr	Ind	I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
tr	Ind	"The upstairs "" guest suite "" is pretty neat ."
tr	Ind	It ' s got its own bathroom and tv , and is pretty cozy .
tr	Ind	As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes , if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn ' t tell by his voice .
tr	Ind	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Ind	But , I guess , it ' s a start ...
tr	Ind	I ' ve already made my XMAS plans .
tr	Ind	I leave the evening of the 21st , my flight comes in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am .
tr	Ind	It ' s good chatting with you .
tr	Ind	"I don ' t understand , what do you mean by "" log in an email ""?"
tr	Ind	Anyway , I got you message , and I got the World Series thing ( although I had already received
tr	Ind	Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving , I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I ' ve ever had ( I not gonna tell them that , I don ' t want them getting swell heads ).
tr	Ind	Ma said she had a great time in Houston , She was happy to see yourself , as well as C & D .
tr	Ind	I think she likes her special room in your house .
tr	Ind	Your gonna be the first to see the new baby ( woudn ' t it be wierd if the baby gets botn on Jan 5th ?)
tr	Ind	Why didn ' t Craig show Ma his appartment ?
tr	Ind	What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben ( he was almost shocked )?
tr	Ind	Are you coming for Xmas ?
tr	Ind	Love ya .
tr	Ind	Your World Series in Question document : was received Kyle Jones / US / AMERICAS / Equant by : at : 01 : 00 : 51 PM Today
tr	Ind	Attached are the GCP Signoffs on EOL Approvals for 11 / 29 / 00 with GCP responses marked in Red .
tr	Ind	Attached is the referenced agreement .
tr	Ind	Thinking about that , what ' s your title ?
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure you have the authority to sign documents w / o special authority ...
tr	Ind	No , it does not mean that .
tr	Ind	Our concern is that we don ' t want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component .
tr	Ind	If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
tr	Ind	"With respect to Deutsche Bank ("""" DB ""), we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
tr	Ind	Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue .
tr	Ind	With respect to First Union National Bank , the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11 / 8 / 00 for review .
tr	Ind	Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey , another paralegal in our Group .
tr	Ind	can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of .
tr	Ind	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co - signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we ' re OK .
tr	Ind	The referenced TAGG # was entered as a ' New Counterparty ', can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure .
tr	Ind	Thank you ,
tr	Ind	Sorry I haven ' t written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated .
tr	Ind	I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don ' t think I ' m going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
tr	Ind	As much fun as they are , I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them .
tr	Ind	As for Ted , things are still going well although I haven ' t see him at all this week ( we are two very busy people ).
tr	Ind	But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
tr	Ind	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Ind	Anyway , I ' m sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
tr	Ind	Hopefully , if we ' re still dating come December , you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit .
tr	Ind	I ' m planning on dragging him to at least one of the U . T . games , I just have to find out when he wants to go ( as well as properly prepare him for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that is a U . T . game ).
tr	Ind	Things in Houston are good and definitely warm .
tr	Ind	"I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" Rent "" and it was wonderful ."
tr	Ind	Also , I ' m going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot ' s daughter Julie .
tr	Ind	Needless to say I am very excited .
tr	Ind	How are you doing ?
tr	Ind	Haven ' t heard from you in a while .
tr	Ind	A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul .
tr	Ind	Are you really ?
tr	Ind	In any case , we have had some more time to do some exploring ( and shopping ), so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come .
tr	Ind	I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
tr	Ind	We ' ll do whatever you want want if you still are coming !
tr	Ind	Do You Yahoo !?
tr	Ind	The play was very good and I think well received .
tr	Ind	I ' d forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
tr	Ind	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling ).
tr	Ind	I caught the third day of Corey ' s Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job !).
tr	Ind	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Ind	As a result of that , she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me ( The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia ).
tr	Ind	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went .
tr	Ind	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn ' t spell her name right in the email - I mean it ' s such a common spelling .
tr	Ind	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they ' d make a good match ?
tr	Ind	She ' s a very fun girl .
tr	Ind	Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch .
tr	Ind	-- Due to the lack of response yesterday , I ' m beginning to worry about your success with the road test ...
tr	Ind	I ' m going to assume that you didn ' t get around to it .
tr	Ind	How was the play ?
tr	Ind	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Ind	I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
tr	Ind	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
tr	Ind	I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully .
tr	Ind	However , having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors .
tr	Ind	I ' ll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
tr	Ind	Now back to what ' s really important ... you .
tr	Ind	Thought you ' d like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec . 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it ' s all about you and your needs .
tr	Ind	I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam both written and on the rode .
tr	Ind	This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire .
tr	Ind	I know I need some of your organizational skills .
tr	Ind	I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ).
tr	Ind	How ' s life on 32 today -- well that ' s enough about you let ' s talk more about me .
tr	Ind	There is no pleasure in having nothing to do ; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it .
tr	Ind	As we discussed , the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue :
tr	Ind	Direct access connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access .
tr	Ind	This e - mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential .
tr	Ind	The least we can do is pass this news along .
tr	Ind	Is there anyone else we should tell ?
tr	Ind	fyi ... it sound like Bobby is in serious condition .
tr	Ind	I think they ' ll send us another update once he ' s out of emergency and into a room .?
tr	Ind	Then it ' s real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number .? The address is below .?
tr	Ind	It doesn ' t sound like he can receive visitors yet .
tr	Ind	Do you know the address to send cards ??
tr	Ind	Do you know if Bobby can see visitors ??
tr	Ind	Thought you might like to know .
tr	Ind	Jann , phoned this morning and asked me to pass this information to the group , concerning Bobby Riggins .
tr	Ind	Bobby is a member of a bicycle team , while cycling this weekend , he and other members of his team were injured by a truck .?
tr	Ind	There was one death in the injured group and the others with major injuries .?
tr	Ind	Bobby is one of those with major injuries .?
tr	Ind	He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub Hospital .?
tr	Ind	Ben Taub hospital is located at 1504 Taub Loop , Houston , Texas , phone number : 713 - 793 - 2000 .?
tr	Ind	He cannot accept calls , visits or flowers at this time , since he is in the emergency room .?
tr	Ind	An update will be e - mailed , as soon as one is available .
tr	Ind	I think it ' s a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ).
tr	Ind	We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages ( like the homepage ).
tr	Ind	Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires ?
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually , I ' m sure I don ' t have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me .
tr	Ind	Michael and myself are planing to be in Hoston on Thursday and Friday of this week .
tr	Ind	We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL implementation .
tr	Ind	Thank you
tr	Ind	Argentina intend to press ahead even given the concern about taxes , etc .
tr	Ind	They wish to launch on Sept . 1 - meaning we will need to be sending mailings sometime around mid - August .
tr	Ind	Just wanted to know were we stand on the ETA and PA for Argentina ?
tr	Ind	If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know where this stands officially ( I haven ' t heard any developments since Amsterdam ) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want .
tr	Ind	I am thinking 4 slides at the most .
tr	Ind	Is that what you want ?
tr	Ind	Days away : Sept . 21 through Oct . 3 ( assuming you work on the day we leave and go back to work the day after we return )
tr	Ind	To make matters even more confusing , there are two Mark Taylors .
tr	Ind	I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI ( based in London ).
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , I can ' t forward your message to him directly ( there seems to be a problem with the attachment ).
tr	Ind	"If you still have it , can you send it to him at "" Mark EI . London Taylor ""?"
tr	Ind	Enclosed is a worksheet for Ineos Acrylics .
tr	Ind	Ineos is an English company which has a majority of its operations in the US .
tr	Ind	I left you a voice mail on Friday .
tr	Ind	I looked at the UEComm Master and had some comments -- such as our name is wrong , the cross default threshold for us should be US $ and not AUD , and there were a few other questions I had .
tr	Ind	Attached are Uecomm ' s final comments to the Master Agreement .
tr	Ind	John Suttle has OK ' d Anthony ' s latest request w / r . t . the CSA .
tr	Ind	If they ' re OK with it , we ' d like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections .
tr	Ind	I have inserted the company details of Uecomm as requested .
tr	Ind	I have also amended the timeframes in the Credit Support Annex to 10 days instead of 2 days .
tr	Ind	I have tracked all changes for ease of reference .
tr	Ind	If these amendmnets are agreeable to you can you please print and arrange for execution .
tr	Ind	Attached for your further handling is the draft form Deemed ISDA between ENA and Ispat Mexicana S . A . de C . V .
tr	Ind	Here ' s info on the Elliotts .
tr	Ind	"We ' ve been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "" Babies Elliott "" had arrived ."
tr	Ind	Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size , and that Mom is doing well .
tr	Ind	Look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones .
tr	Ind	I know you all are going to have so much fun with them .
tr	Ind	Hope you ' ve been storing up sleep , cause it looks like you won ' t be getting much for a while .
tr	Ind	These three little ones don ' t realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad , but I ' m sure they ' ll find out soon .
tr	Ind	This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday , 6th July , to our triplets :
tr	Ind	"Although small , they are all "" fully functioning "" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care ( and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks ) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights ."
tr	Ind	Emma is fine , too - very well !!
tr	Ind	Attached are the fax cover pages for each of the Nylon and Polykron Deemed ISDAs I just sent you .
tr	Ind	I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts .
tr	Ind	I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer .
tr	Ind	Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp . likes their resolutions drafted than we are .
tr	Ind	I am following up regarding the status of our comments to the form of guaranty for Pemex that you provided to Lucy Ortiz .
tr	Ind	We look forward to hearing your comments .
tr	Ind	Attached are an original and blacklined copy of your form of guaranty , which reflect our comments .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your assistance .
tr	Ind	I received this draft from Niagara Mohawk Marketing , Inc . for our review .
tr	Ind	per our conversation yesterday afternoon , attached are proposed drafts of the Schedule and the Para . 13 relative to the above .
tr	Ind	Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann , I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $ 8M each : one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f / b / o Enron , and one by Enron Inc . f / b / o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing .
tr	Ind	I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $ 10M for each party , but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly .
tr	Ind	After you have had the chance to review the attached , please send me a marked - up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there .
tr	Ind	I look forward to hearing from you .
tr	Ind	Did you get a chance to find those GTC ' s for ENA that you can forward this way ?
tr	Ind	Thanks , I know you are busy .
tr	Ind	Attached are the draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement , together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex .
tr	Ind	I am putting the credit worksheet on the fax machine to you as soon as I send this message .
tr	Ind	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
tr	Ind	Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end )?
tr	Ind	If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
tr	Ind	Evidently , this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now .
tr	Ind	There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value .
tr	Ind	I ' m now looking closely at the option liquidation problems .
tr	Ind	I believe that there might be a sign - flipping problem for PUTS that ' s causing this whole issue .
tr	Ind	Karim - this ' s likely the explanation to your other question ...
tr	Ind	I ' ll get back to you as soon as I have more info ( hopefully later today )
tr	Ind	The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608 .
tr	Ind	I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $ 65 puts are in the money and the $ 75 call is also in the money .
tr	Ind	The liq value for the call is CORRECT .
tr	Ind	I don ' t want to wait till month end , let ' s adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order , lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts .

tr	Ind	The liq value for the call is CORRECT .
tr	Ind	OK , now that I ' ve got your attention - I really am offering free lunch !
tr	Ind	We ' re gearing up for our 2001 / 02 recruiting campaign and we think your experience will help us define what works best and what can be improved in our process .
tr	Ind	For those of you in Toronto , I apologize for not being able to schedule this over your lunch time !
tr	Ind	I ' ve booked Videoconference Room # 1 .
tr	Ind	Attached is the revised draft paper that reflects our conference call with Bob Fagan earlier this week .
tr	Ind	I propose we have a conference call with Bob Fagan on Fri July 20 at 1 : 00 pm Calgary time to discuss any areas of concern / confusion you may have .
tr	Ind	Also , would those of you who have not responded to me via email confirming your acceptance of the terms upon which our four companies have agreed to assume cost responsibility for the TCA work on this .
tr	Ind	Attached is the letter I originally sent to you on May 10 in this regard .
tr	Ind	This draft reflects the changes we discussed during our call the other day .
tr	Ind	I ' ve also included a redlined draft showing changes .
tr	Ind	With reference to Article 5 , section 5 . 1 ( b ), are we going to propose an alternative planned outage to TAU for next year ?
tr	Ind	We have already received firm commitments from 3 companies .
tr	Ind	A formal invitation will follow to those who respond .
tr	Ind	We need responses or direction by no later than COB on Monday , October 30 , 2000 .
tr	Ind	Thank you ,
tr	Ind	Everyone is extremely pleased that you ' re joining .
tr	Ind	I ' ll believe it when I see it .
tr	Ind	Seems like a good idea to keep the heat on Hoecker & Co . right up until Nov . 1 .
tr	Ind	I ' m glad they want to follow - up with Steve ( I ' ve been pushing it ) and I ' ve got some follow - up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post - call .
tr	Ind	FYI , we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with Sue and Robbie et al .
tr	Ind	They indicated they could use Steve ' s help face to face at some point .
tr	Ind	We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues , case law and MSA self - certification language , and let me know if you have additional items .
tr	Ind	We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the CPUC .
tr	Ind	Attached for your review are draft talking points for the Cal Energy Markets conference I ' m speaking at on Thursday in SF .
tr	Ind	All comments , suggestions , etc . are appreciated .
tr	Ind	Here ' s the info for calling in -- thanks !
tr	Ind	The call - in number and instructions for the 11 / 2 8 : 30 a . m . meeting are as follows :
tr	Ind	All the outside participants will be prompted to enter their access code , which is 600 - 480 .
tr	Ind	I have asked for 4 outside ports and should anyone else need to join in , they may do so with the access code and without operator assistance .
tr	Ind	The duration of the call is 3 . 5 hours .
tr	Ind	The call will terminate once everyone has hung up .
tr	Ind	Attached for your review are copies of the settlement documents that were filed today in the Gas Industry Restructuring / Natural Gas Strategy proceeding , including the Motion for Approval of the Comprehensive Settlement that is supported by thirty signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement , the Comprehensive Settlement document itself , and the various appendices to the settlement .?
tr	Ind	Because a number of the declarations and signature pages are not yet available electronically , they have not been included with this note .?
tr	Ind	Hard copies of the Comprehensive Settlement , including all declarations and signature pages , are being shipped tonight via US mail to all parties on the service list .?
tr	Ind	I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement process .?
tr	Ind	You have all devoted considerable time , resources and spirit in the preparation of this document - and it shows .?
tr	Ind	We now have a settlement before the Commission that includes ratepayer advocates , commercial and industrial customers , electric generators , marketers , shippers , independent storage providers ,? gas suppliers ,? producers , utilities , aggregators , pipeline companies , wholesale customers , municipalities , and retail mass marketers , among others .?
tr	Ind	Assignments have already been made and I will schedule a conference call later this week to discuss related details .?
tr	Ind	Once again , thank you all for an outstanding accomplishment .
tr	Ind	Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I ' ll be on at a CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon .
tr	Ind	Have distributed to Western GA team ( plus Steffes ) for comment and thought you may have some , too .
tr	Ind	Goal is to ( politely ?) refute Loretta Lynch ' s and Carl Woods ' continued assertions that 1 ) California ' s move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2 ) the solution is to turn back the clock to command - and - control regulation .
tr	Ind	The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat .
tr	Ind	Comments are much appreciated .
tr	Ind	As we discussed yesterday , Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday .
tr	Ind	We ' ll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S . D . last week .
tr	Ind	You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product .
tr	Ind	My flight gets into S . D . at at 8 : 35 on southwest .
tr	Ind	Sandi sez it ' s actually happening at 10 AM and it ' s renewable - focused .
tr	Ind	Marly asked me to respond to you .
tr	Ind	As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
tr	Ind	Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
tr	Ind	Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ), I ' d say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
tr	Ind	However , if you use a particular logo for the on - line service , that should be registered .
tr	Ind	I hope the above is clear .
tr	Ind	I ' m @ X37047 .
tr	Ind	"I believe we are to some extent already protected with "" Enron "" proceeded with anything , but EnronOnline ( TM ) , etc . just affords us more protection ."
tr	Ind	"I assume this is akin to why McDonald ' s trademarks "" Mc "" Everything ?"
tr	Ind	"i . e . Are we covered if we proceed a word with "" Enron ""?"
tr	Ind	If we are covered , then was it necessary to register EnronOnline ?
tr	Ind	This message is confidential .
tr	Ind	Per my conversation with Edmund this morning , we are moving the following countries to the non - approved list : Austria , Belgium , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Singapore , and Slovenia .
tr	Ind	Below is the list , now updated to reflect this change .
tr	Ind	Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives : Finland , Germany , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland , the U . K , and the U . S ..
tr	Ind	Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include : Austria , Belgium , Canada , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , France , Gibraltar , Ireland , Italy , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Scotland , Singapore , Slovenia , Spain , and The Netherlands .
tr	Ind	"With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with , do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "" eligible swap participant "" equivalant rules ?"
tr	Ind	You are the best !
tr	Ind	Why does it always have to be my deals ...?!!!
tr	Ind	We ' ve received a personal invitation to a NYMEX Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 5 : 00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan .
tr	Ind	The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract .
tr	Ind	We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas , which adds the Canadian Securities Representation , so we don ' t have to add the rep into every confirm .
tr	Ind	BC Gas won ' t sign the confirms with the rep in , and this has caused much difficulties .
tr	Ind	I am going to count it as signed , since BC Gas has signed , but we still need it to be signed by ECC .
tr	Ind	We have received the executed Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade , Inc . dated March 2 , 2000 .
tr	Ind	This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph ( c ) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement .
tr	Ind	Updating another blue file because Susan B ., this time , has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes !
tr	Ind	It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on , and you probably didn ' t see them at first .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up .
tr	Ind	When you have a minute , I ' ll give me a call and I ' ll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel .
tr	Ind	I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives , and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London .
tr	Ind	I communicated that to Bob Bowen .
tr	Ind	He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business .
tr	Ind	i ' m a gas trader on the west desk and one of my customers had some issues with our electronic trading agreement .
tr	Ind	the company is Arco Products , adn their comments are on the attached file .
tr	Ind	Torrey , as promised I have attached ARCO ' s suggested revisions to the Enron online trading agreement .
tr	Ind	I look forward to working toward a mutually satisfactory agreement in this new and thorny area of e - commerce contracting .
tr	Ind	We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1 , 1999 .
tr	Ind	This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities Act representation to the master .
tr	Ind	Here ' s the list with the missing counterparties .
tr	Ind	I just got a call from Dave and Frank and they tell me I have a whole week this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade Australian financial power .
tr	Ind	In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are behind schedule .
tr	Ind	Additional resources are being allocated and the situation is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operations ).
tr	Ind	Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .
tr	Ind	Consequently I need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the following :
tr	Ind	that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses , AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable )
tr	Ind	The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
tr	Ind	A reconciling difference of $ 15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p & l as generated on the AS400 .
tr	Ind	The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
tr	Ind	Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
tr	Ind	Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business .
tr	Ind	"Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ("" OBSF "") which commenced two weeks before the year end ."
tr	Ind	The discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the AS400 Merchanting code , arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality , which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF .
tr	Ind	The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave .
tr	Ind	Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet .
tr	Ind	The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers .
tr	Ind	The AR / AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1 .
tr	Ind	Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses .
tr	Ind	The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA / excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads .
tr	Ind	User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF .
tr	Ind	A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates
tr	Ind	Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
tr	Ind	Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
tr	Ind	I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April
tr	Ind	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year .
tr	Ind	I understand how competitive the process has become , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , personality , extracurricular activities , etc . that this would compensate for my disability .
tr	Ind	After talking with Professors Titman , Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for .
tr	Ind	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Ind	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level .
tr	Ind	I also plan on retaking the GMAT test .
tr	Ind	Due to my disability , this will be a monumental task ; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business .
tr	Ind	If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .
tr	Ind	In the end , the results were not favorable .
tr	Ind	I understand that it is a competitive process , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , extracurricular activities , etc ., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate for my disability .
tr	Ind	After talking with you and Professors Titman , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy - finance .
tr	Ind	I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Ind	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level .
tr	Ind	I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test .
tr	Ind	Due to my disability , this will be a monumental task , but I am determined to prove to the Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business .
tr	Ind	It has been a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future .
tr	Ind	In the end , the results were not favorable .
tr	Ind	I understand that it is a competitive process , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , extrcurricular activities , etc ., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability .
tr	Ind	After talking with you and Professors Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy - finance .
tr	Ind	I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Ind	I plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level .
tr	Ind	I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test .
tr	Ind	Due to my disability , this will be a monumental task , but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business .
tr	Ind	I know that with my industry - wide and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund .
tr	Ind	I am very interested in energy - finance and think that your idea is a very good .
tr	Ind	It has been a pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future .
tr	Ind	Sorry about that , I was working on the Teco O & M costs .
tr	Ind	I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
tr	Ind	What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub ?
tr	Ind	What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra - day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols )?
tr	Ind	What expiration date are you using , i . e .: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?
tr	Ind	What correlation are you assuming , 15 % flat for twenty years ?
tr	Ind	Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option ?
tr	Ind	"Are you using the "" SPRDOPT "" Exotic Options function to value the option ?"
tr	Ind	Are you using the $/ MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike ?
tr	Ind	Has Don provided the fixed payment stream ?
tr	Ind	Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far .
tr	Ind	Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC ' s goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
tr	Ind	This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .
tr	Ind	Randy , this is the issue I left you the voice mail on .
tr	Ind	"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to "" work in good faith with CDEC "" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC ' s system ."
tr	Ind	"We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "" assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses "" associated with the manual system ."
tr	Ind	"We will fight with them about who owes the $ 200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "" assist "" us in managing the cost ."
tr	Ind	In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .
tr	Ind	Do we have someone who is watching this out there ?
tr	Ind	We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected , but let me know what we can do .
tr	Ind	James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info . from CDEC .
tr	Ind	That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS , but it that ' s what they are saying , let me know and we can figure out a solution .
tr	Ind	My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC ' s online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC ' s peak load periods .
tr	Ind	We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200 , 987 . 33 for the period of July through September .
tr	Ind	Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , that I have not been able to review yet .
tr	Ind	This cost is averaging $ 79 , 000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September .
tr	Ind	Good point , but I ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .
tr	Ind	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .
tr	Ind	None of them did , and most importantly , the winning bidders did not .
tr	Ind	Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates .
tr	Ind	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?
tr	Ind	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
tr	Ind	My concern with adding the language below is , could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate ??
tr	Ind	After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we ' ve done .
tr	Ind	If there are any objections you need to get back to me ASAP .
tr	Ind	In discussion with Dave , we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers .
tr	Ind	However , as you will see , the questions I thought of got kinda long - but I think we need answers for all of them .
tr	Ind	One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I ' ve listed .
tr	Ind	Here it is .
tr	Ind	Here is the attachment ...
tr	Ind	Attached is my draft of a request for rehearing .
tr	Ind	It incorporates Mr . Stojic ' s and Mr . Kelly ' s initial comments .
tr	Ind	Thank you !
tr	Ind	Forgot to cc you .
tr	Ind	Lou , do we have any sort of policy on requests like this ?
tr	Ind	Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair ( she only wanted one , however ).
tr	Ind	This particular chair is designed to help with back problems , which she has .
tr	Ind	Many people at Enron already have this type of chair , but we rarely , if ever , have a surplus because they are so popular .
tr	Ind	The cost is $ 567 . 77 per chair plus tax .
tr	Ind	sorry , i left lou off of the message .

tr	Ind	I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM ' s spies intercepted .
tr	Ind	She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him .
tr	Ind	Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer ' s duplicity , but after tempers cooled , MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response .
tr	Ind	As it stands , MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers .
tr	Ind	Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he ' s on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation .
tr	Ind	Yea -- it was outstanding news !
tr	Ind	Who is responsible for completing all paperwork for entering a new market ?
tr	Ind	Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC ?
tr	Ind	There have been some issues with getting everything coordinated lately and I wanted to make sure that we knew who was on point .
tr	Ind	Am I scheduled to attend ?
tr	Ind	The meeting is being held in conjunction with the third meeting of our DISCO of the Future Forum .
tr	Ind	Following the Board meeting on Wednesday , you are invited to join with members of the DISCO Forum for a Wednesday evening reception and dinner , including a guest speaker .
tr	Ind	Board members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO Forum on Thursday , September 13 .
tr	Ind	Because of an international medical convention ongoing in Washington at the same time as our meetings , the Grand Hyatt unfortunately is already booked .
tr	Ind	However , we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel .
tr	Ind	To reserve one of these rooms , you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group .
tr	Ind	We are looking forward to seeing you on September 12 .
tr	Ind	Is this correct ?
tr	Ind	We are receiving invoices from Ace Federal Reporters for transcripts of the recent FERC settlement conferences .
tr	Ind	Linda Robertson says they should be charged to Jim Steffes ' cost center , etc .
tr	Ind	Do you want me to send the invoices to you ?
tr	Ind	I ' m in all week .
tr	Ind	Can we visit about what went on with Ursula at the PRC meeting when you catch up ?
tr	Ind	A revised version of the Evaluation form for Associates and Analysts is attached below .
tr	Ind	We do need a formal plan .
tr	Ind	We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions .
tr	Ind	Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information .
tr	Ind	We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
tr	Ind	The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue , providing specific examples and proposing the solution .
tr	Ind	Grand - standing is ignored .
tr	Ind	Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored .
tr	Ind	Those who show up and complain , but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls , board meetings , etc . are ignored .
tr	Ind	Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
tr	Ind	Thane and I also visited with him .
tr	Ind	Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed .
tr	Ind	( Even though he has bigger things to do in D . C ., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas , the repercussions could be global .)
tr	Ind	Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens ( of the Texas legislature ) are also engaged in market developments .
tr	Ind	We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised .
tr	Ind	There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th .
tr	Ind	The forum is expected to be invited testimony only .
tr	Ind	Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot ' s Sam Jones and Tom Noel .
tr	Ind	The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom .
tr	Ind	Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt . Governor , there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions .
tr	Ind	Thane is in Austin on Friday , but is available by phone .
tr	Ind	Can we find another time that works for us to meet ?
tr	Ind	Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9 : 30 until 3 : 00 .
tr	Ind	I am available after Rick ' s Friday budget meeting ... are you available then ?
tr	Ind	You are right , we do need a formal plan , Thane has started an initial draft .
tr	Ind	Walking out last night , Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets .
tr	Ind	Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes .
tr	Ind	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Ind	As important , the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market .
tr	Ind	Jean and Thane , I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation .
tr	Ind	I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick ' s budget meeting .
tr	Ind	As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago , we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities , and possibly electric activities , in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders .
tr	Ind	We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order , filing , etc . with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information .
tr	Ind	This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting .
tr	Ind	Many details remain to be worked out , but we will keep you advised .
tr	Ind	What do I need to do ?
tr	Ind	I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems .
tr	Ind	Peter is looking currently for a job .
tr	Ind	I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston .
tr	Ind	I enjoyed your presentation , and meeting you briefly afterwards , at the SIAM Workshop last Friday .
tr	Ind	I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and development of modeling and simulation software products , mostly for the oil and gas pipeline industry .
tr	Ind	I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and mathematical skills .
tr	Ind	Your answer to a question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for .
tr	Ind	Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting experience .
tr	Ind	Publications are available on request .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your time .
tr	Ind	Sorry I guess I didn ' t read it very well .
tr	Ind	It ' s ok with me .
tr	Ind	I am talking to a number of people regarding opportunities for a new assignment back in Houston office .
tr	Ind	Thought since I will be in Houston , stop by your office for few minutes .
tr	Ind	What is the subject matter you wish to visit about ?
tr	Ind	I figured this posting belonged to one of you .
tr	Ind	I have recently been made aware of a help desk analyst job # 0000108806 that has become available in your department .
tr	Ind	I am currently employed with the aviation department ( hangar attendant ) of enron and would like to use my past knowledge and experience to persue my goals in the technology feild .
tr	Ind	I am asking respectfully if you could give me a recommendation or referral to ETS technology department .
tr	Ind	I have contacted the relevant people of your interest in the job .

tr	Ind	When the company is set up in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP ID .
tr	Ind	It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
tr	Ind	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."

tr	Ind	Thanks Bill - appreciate your help !
tr	Ind	"We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include , "" a division of Cargill Incorporated ""."
tr	Ind	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Ind	The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty ' s name from Global Counterparty .
tr	Ind	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .
tr	Ind	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
tr	Ind	That is the source of Tana ' s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
tr	Ind	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
tr	Ind	In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .
tr	Ind	Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill , Inc .
tr	Ind	Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub - to - Legal Link to Cargill , Inc . per GCP procedure .
tr	Ind	Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Ind	GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously .
tr	Ind	( Although , we have broken that rule for Legal in the past .)
tr	Ind	This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename .
tr	Ind	With divisions , EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below .
tr	Ind	When the company is set up in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP ID .
tr	Ind	It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
tr	Ind	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."
tr	Ind	There ' s a new EOL Counterparty listed in the UK .
tr	Ind	I ' m handling the afternoon -- I think that Harry has this morning .
tr	Ind	I am in mediation .
tr	Ind	I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher , as well , just to make sure it is handled .
tr	Ind	My schedule shows an afternoon session .
tr	Ind	Do we have 2 sessions today ?
tr	Ind	I got this .
tr	Ind	I assume this is 12 : 30 Central Time ?
tr	Ind	Here is the overview of Bob Henderson ' s Employment Agreement .
tr	Ind	What do you think ?
tr	Ind	After that , what do we do ?
tr	Ind	After a conversation with Ryan Seleznov I herewith like disclose in writing my intentions in respect to Dealbench .
tr	Ind	We ' re formatting one this week , and we ' ll send it when it ' s done .
tr	Ind	Do you also have a SSD we can use ?
tr	Ind	Here are the sample Agreements .
tr	Ind	I agree also , but I don ' t know all the parties or complications involved .
tr	Ind	I agree with what the concern is below .
tr	Ind	We have GIS ids , and Eid ( external id - just like GIS id ).
tr	Ind	I think we should try to migrate to one of these .
tr	Ind	Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information .
tr	Ind	I am very concerned about this issue .
tr	Ind	I have the following suggestion for our company .
tr	Ind	Since Enron ' s employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers ( P number ) and an HR number , could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers ?
tr	Ind	For example , I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number .
tr	Ind	I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron , especially when some databases are from third - parties ( out - sourcing ).
tr	Ind	The Leads who are responsible for Associates are as follows :
tr	Ind	Peer reviews are currently been gathered on the above .
tr	Ind	Those who are not assigned an associate may also allocate points ( a max of 150 ) at the meeting based on contribution to your areas for the first review period .
tr	Ind	Shanna , I spoke with Per tonight about this .
tr	Ind	This is the background to my conversation with Shanna .
tr	Ind	I have a copy of the document I can give to you tomorrow .
tr	Ind	I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher .
tr	Ind	John , Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions .
tr	Ind	I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur .
tr	Ind	Thank you
tr	Ind	I wanted to let you know about this before I respond to her request .
tr	Ind	Kathy McMahon suggested that I contact you in an effort to gather information on : Enron ' s Affirmative Action Policy and plans ; as well as demographic analysis of workforce ( gender , age , ethnic origin , nationality )
tr	Ind	Jeff Skilling has agreed to work with Harvard Business School ( HBS ) on a 5 - year case study called ' Modern Giants '.
tr	Ind	HBS will shadow Enron and a number of other companies over the next five years to assess how we react to market changes and to see how we morph during this time period .
tr	Ind	We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth , Florida project as well .
tr	Ind	Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work .
tr	Ind	In that respect , we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team .
tr	Ind	I think the first step is a call between yourself , me , Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero .
tr	Ind	I have been advised by our Construction Manager , Mr . Joe Osler that while he was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired about permit requirements to picket our site .
tr	Ind	Apparently the City informed them that no permit is required .
tr	Ind	I have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today .
tr	Ind	Mike Indivero , I understand that Mr . Mike Croall ' s release date from NEPCO is Oct 31 , 2001 .
tr	Ind	Sara , trading is still not settled .
tr	Ind	Thank you for the invitaion to the conference call .
tr	Ind	I assume we should come over EB .
tr	Ind	, Do you want us to come over to the Enron b in your call .
tr	Ind	Have you decided who will be assisting tax - wise for these two countries ?
tr	Ind	I have a conference call this afternoon at 3 pm ( Houston time ) with Antonio Felix de Araujo Cintra from the Tozzini firm regarding further research on derivative products for trading in Brazil .
tr	Ind	Attached is a summary of products and the various Enron groups seeking answers .
tr	Ind	How about Friday , Sept . 17 , at 9 am ( Houston time ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) time ?
tr	Ind	NOTICE : This message is confidential .
tr	Ind	Thank you .
tr	Ind	The call was cancelled .
tr	Ind	I am waiting to hear about a possible call Friday morning .
tr	Ind	If something happens that I ' m not able to participate I ' ll let you know .
tr	Ind	This call has been changed to 3 pm ( Houston time ) which is 5 pm ( Sao Paulo time ).
tr	Ind	The draft you received has been approved by Dan .
tr	Ind	Looks good .
tr	Ind	My extension is 35620 .
tr	Ind	I e - mailed your assistant earlier this morning and have had no response .
tr	Ind	Can we reschedule the phone call for 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) on Friday , Sept . 17 ?
tr	Ind	The conference call has been rescheduled for Friday , Sept . 17 at 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ).
tr	Ind	I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading .
tr	Ind	It ' s a good starting point .
tr	Ind	I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina which will address both physical and financial trading .
tr	Ind	"Other "" guidelines "" exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia ."
tr	Ind	I am checking on London .
tr	Ind	I ' m not exactly certain as to what you are looking for .
tr	Ind	Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US ( although LA . is about as close as you can get to a third world country ).
tr	Ind	One thing that doesn ' t show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue .
tr	Ind	Here it is -- we printed this 2 - sided and laminated it .
tr	Ind	It looks like the 2 - day L / C issue is an issue .
tr	Ind	Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original .
tr	Ind	He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight .
tr	Ind	Hope you ' ll have time to review it today .
tr	Ind	S & S has again asked about the gtee and l / c wording .
tr	Ind	They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes .
tr	Ind	Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5 ) and the new l / c wording ( drops the 2 day period to replace an l / c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay ).
tr	Ind	I know we talked about these issues earlier , but Tiger ' s lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing , even if we are the one ' s issuing the gtee and l / c .
tr	Ind	There is an outside chance we could have everything set to go this week .
tr	Ind	To what do I owe this small pleasure ?
tr	Ind	I ' m fine in Texas , still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe , working hard , etc .
tr	Ind	Where are you living these days ?
tr	Ind	I ' ve simply lost track !
tr	Ind	As for me , well , I lead the simple life , own a little house in West University , own a little car ( I had to buy a new one recently - the 14 - year old 380 SE started scaring me a bit ), you know , the usual .
tr	Ind	Are you selling burgers up and down the east coast ?
tr	Ind	Have you gone international ?
tr	Ind	How ' s your family ?
tr	Ind	This weekend I ' m off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires on business .
tr	Ind	Hope all is well .
tr	Ind	Do you miss me ?
tr	Ind	Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines ( physical and financial ) for the London traders .
tr	Ind	I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions ( first Argentina ) and thought your expertise would be very helpful .
tr	Ind	I ' m leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your help .
tr	Ind	( if .....) ( iii ) definitive agreements acceptable to Party A in its sole discretion regarding the debt and all other aspects of [ the project to be owned by Party B ], including but not limited to the senior debt facility , commitments and all project documents , have been fully negotiated and executed and the [ project ] has been brought to financial close .
tr	Ind	Sara , here are the trader guidelines I developed for UK gas , UK power and Nordic power .
tr	Ind	I assume you need both gas and power .
tr	Ind	These are to some extent country or market specific .
tr	Ind	As these guidelines need to be approved by Houston , I am copying this to Mark , Alan and Jeff .
tr	Ind	Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines ( physical and financial ) for the London traders .
tr	Ind	I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions ( first Argentina ) and thought your expertise would be very helpful .
tr	Ind	I ' m leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your help .
tr	Ind	Thank you ,
tr	Ind	Parties , attached is the promised ruling that provides procedural guidance for the hearings on 12 / 27 and 12 / 28 .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your patience and I hope you can take a few moments to enjoy the holidays .
tr	Ind	Attached is PG & E ' s Gas Accord II ( GA II ) Settlement Proposal .
tr	Ind	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Ind	As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
tr	Ind	* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *
tr	Ind	* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *
tr	Ind	* Offers a 7 . 5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
tr	Ind	* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ). *
tr	Ind	* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3 . 5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
tr	Ind	* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *
tr	Ind	* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *
tr	Ind	* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .
tr	Ind	PG & E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today ' s mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
tr	Ind	This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG & E ' s headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
tr	Ind	We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback .
tr	Ind	The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal , an Attachment ( a copy of PG & E ' s proposed Gas Rule 27 ), and a set of supporting workpapers .
tr	Ind	We look forward to seeing you on January 10 - 11 .
tr	Ind	In the meantime , we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season .
tr	Ind	This is to inform that a representative of Enron Corp would like to address the Commission on the issue of utility rate stabilization plans at the Commission ' s hearings scheduled for December 27th and 28th .
tr	Ind	Thank you .
tr	Ind	Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission ' s hearings .
tr	Ind	Our time is likely to be limited to 5 - 10 minutes .
tr	Ind	Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will forward that along for folks review later today .
tr	Ind	The call in number is 800 . 713 . 8600 .
tr	Ind	Code is 80435 .
tr	Ind	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).
tr	Ind	Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission ' s hearings .
tr	Ind	Our time is likely to be limited to 5 - 10 minutes .
tr	Ind	Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will forward that along for folks review later today .
tr	Ind	The call in number is 800 . 713 . 8600 .
tr	Ind	Code is 80435 .
tr	Ind	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).
tr	Ind	That ' s a very good point .
tr	Ind	"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
tr	Ind	In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
tr	Ind	Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .
tr	Ind	We ' re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
tr	Ind	But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .
tr	Ind	"OBSERVATION -- The pressure to finger somebody for "" price gouging "" is increasing ."
tr	Ind	"The administration is hell bent on finding a "" fall guy ."""
tr	Ind	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
tr	Ind	"His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "" refunds ."""
tr	Ind	On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .
tr	Ind	And Carl Wood ' s remarks were extreme .
tr	Ind	At the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked arms in calling for refunds .
tr	Ind	"Bilbray joined the "" gouging "" band wagon ."
tr	Ind	"The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "" real "" investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works ."
tr	Ind	On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
tr	Ind	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Ind	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Ind	IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
tr	Ind	"In the best case , the clamoring for a "" refund "" subsides ."
tr	Ind	In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .
tr	Ind	"In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) "" played by the rules ,"" but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers ."
tr	Ind	You ' re right , Sue .
tr	Ind	Harry also had a good comment --- don ' t specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
tr	Ind	This is a request for your interview participation .
tr	Ind	Due to business reasons , previously scheduled interviewers from the Penn team have had to cancel their participation .
tr	Ind	Currently , I need three interviewers for Thursday , March 1st and one interviewer for Friday , March 2nd .
tr	Ind	Campus interviews are scheduled as follows :
tr	Ind	In the event that you have scheduling conflicts and cannot participate , any referrals at the Director or VP level would be greatly appreciated .
tr	Ind	As always , thank you for your time and please contact me @ ext 58369 if you have any questions .
tr	Ind	have you gotten a price ?
tr	Ind	Tom Byargeon , Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana / Texas oil and gas drilling projects .
tr	Ind	This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities .
tr	Ind	Just like what happened in Enron ' s initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects .
tr	Ind	They are currently working on a bid ( due 1 / 31 ) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy ( operator ), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
tr	Ind	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40 , 000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
tr	Ind	Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25 - 27 API Gravity and 1 . 5 - 2 . 0 % sulfur .
tr	Ind	Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon ' s West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
tr	Ind	Peggy is finding out where WD # 143 pumps to onshore .
tr	Ind	Tom ' s group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis .
tr	Ind	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Ind	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95 , 000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
tr	Ind	We typically only book deals when everything is signed off .
tr	Ind	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Ind	these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .
tr	Ind	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Ind	in our case , they are only hedging .
tr	Ind	we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .
tr	Ind	even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .
tr	Ind	the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back .
tr	Ind	seems like a 5 second decision to me .
tr	Ind	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Ind	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .
tr	Ind	Thank you very much for your quick reply .
tr	Ind	Attached is my resume .
tr	Ind	I highlight the relevant skills in the summary .
tr	Ind	The position is with the EES MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE , RETAIL & COMM , ENRON ENERGY SERVICES .
tr	Ind	It was posted on Dec . 11 , but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet , it is open .
tr	Ind	Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions .
tr	Ind	That girl ' s mother sounds like a real problem .
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure how I would have handled it .
tr	Ind	How ' s school going ?
tr	Ind	What happened ?
tr	Ind	Here ' s a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7 : 35am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I ' d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
tr	Ind	The mother was running late for work and could not wait .
tr	Ind	I couldn ' t say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs . old ) and I waited for the bus .
tr	Ind	It was now , 8 : 15 and there was no sign of her bus .
tr	Ind	On top of things , I had quiz at 8am .
tr	Ind	Which I then realized I missed .
tr	Ind	I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own .
tr	Ind	I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts .
tr	Ind	I called her grandmother and explained things to her .
tr	Ind	A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her , but I couldn ' t do it .
tr	Ind	Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8 : 30am ).
tr	Ind	There were only 15 minutes left of class .
tr	Ind	I stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
tr	Ind	After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived .
tr	Ind	I told the bus driver where to drop her off .
tr	Ind	I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure .
tr	Ind	And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe .
tr	Ind	Actually , Jen has volunteered for the afternoon session .
tr	Ind	I spoke to her prior to my note .
tr	Ind	Is there anyone else in EGM that could participate ?
tr	Ind	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
tr	Ind	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Ind	We are planning this event for Thursday , February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed .
tr	Ind	I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers ( Managers or above ).
tr	Ind	We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9am - 12pm ) or afternoon ( 2pm - 5pm ) complete session .
tr	Ind	In addition , we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer .
tr	Ind	Thank you ,
tr	Ind	Where does our 50 % ( the 1 . 65 million dollars ) show up ?
tr	Ind	This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick reactions and favourable market movements .
tr	Ind	Enron total gain not counting ENA ' s trading desk margin is $ 1 , 922 , 000
tr	Ind	Marianne : The following are my comments :
tr	Ind	4 . In Section 6 . 2 . 1 I ' ll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue .
tr	Ind	8 . Where is the defined term Govt Authority used ?
tr	Ind	11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I ' m not sure exists .
tr	Ind	12 . Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6 . 1 .
tr	Ind	I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .
tr	Ind	1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer ' s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T & D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer ' s utility .
tr	Ind	"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers ."
tr	Ind	If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
tr	Ind	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Ind	"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs )."
tr	Ind	"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ..."
tr	Ind	If you are comfortable , we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms .
tr	Ind	I have faxed to you the form of Bond , our proposed Bond provisions and the EEI Master .
tr	Ind	I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e - mail .
tr	Ind	Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of the language that makes the LC transferable .
tr	Ind	Are you okay with that ?
tr	Ind	If so , are we ready to execute ?
tr	Ind	I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions .
tr	Ind	How are you making out on the revised version of the LOC ?
tr	Ind	In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form , I think you should add a forward contract rep .
tr	Ind	Are we playing tomorrow at 9 : 30 ?
tr	Ind	As I mentioned in my e - mail , John Lepore at Select Energy ( Settlements Group ) is trying to reconcile our list with his list .
tr	Ind	He needs more info about these trades ( i . e ., price info ) and would like to talk with you about it .
tr	Ind	His number is 860 - 665 - 2368 and e - mail address is leporjj @ selectenergy . com .
tr	Ind	Once we agree on the list , we can sign the EEI Master .
tr	Ind	Here ' s everything that flows from 5 / 1 / 01 forward .
tr	Ind	We need to include all outstanding transactions .
tr	Ind	Do you want 6 / 1 / 01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since they have not been settled ?
tr	Ind	Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the version that you sent to me the current version ?
tr	Ind	I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
tr	Ind	I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we ' re all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
tr	Ind	As far as the EEI goes , the only remaining issue that I ' m aware of ( aside from finalizing the LOC ) is whether we ' ve finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions .
tr	Ind	Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week .
tr	Ind	I am missing Deal No . 74419 on your sheet .
tr	Ind	It is Enpower No . 295870 .
tr	Ind	I am missing Deal No . 74419 on your sheet .

tr	Ind	It is Enpower No . 295870 .
tr	Ind	Are we ready to execute ?
tr	Ind	I am out of the office today but will be back tomorrow .
tr	Ind	Our credit person doesn ' t understand why the transferability language needs to be eliminated .
tr	Ind	It simply refers to the same ICC publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit generally .
tr	Ind	Is there some specific concern that we can address ?
tr	Ind	Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
tr	Ind	Our system did not show any other chnages .
tr	Ind	Were there any ?
tr	Ind	I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft .
tr	Ind	It is a fairly standard , fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar .
tr	Ind	"You will notice that Questar has requested a "" Payment Plan "" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events ."
tr	Ind	Also , you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up , but to protect ourselves , we have added language in Para 3 . 2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax .
tr	Ind	Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language .
tr	Ind	We hope to execute this Agreement this week .
tr	Ind	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Ind	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
tr	Ind	Our in - service date is May 1 .
tr	Ind	Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts / materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in - service date of May 1 .
tr	Ind	Has a location , Theirs or TW land / ROW , been settled and when is the required in - service date ?

tr	Ind	We ' ve booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday , May 24 to Newark / Rome and returning on Sunday , June 9 from Rome to Newark / Houston .
tr	Ind	Ticket price was $ 1 , 183 per ticket .
tr	Ind	Paul and Judy are on board .
tr	Ind	John , sorry for the late response , but I think you can implement immediately .
tr	Ind	I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed ( I don ' t remember if you were there or not ) but I ' m thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great , thanks !
tr	Ind	The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use , I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps . to use for updates .
tr	Ind	Do you think we need to do more ?
tr	Ind	I was aware .
tr	Ind	I just couldn ' t remember if it was you or Terry .
tr	Ind	The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email .
tr	Ind	The new Hotline phone number is 713 - 853 - 3044 .
tr	Ind	I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation , TK was also made aware .

tr	Ind	Here it is .
tr	Ind	These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago .
tr	Ind	Are you comfortable with the difference ?
tr	Ind	No hurry , I was just wondering .
tr	Ind	Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report .
tr	Ind	Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $ 180 . 9m .
tr	Ind	The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $ 165 . 9m .
tr	Ind	This difference is mainly due to the following :
tr	Ind	Revenues for these customers were adjusted according .
tr	Ind	Also , revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW ' s tariff rates were adjusted accordingly .
tr	Ind	Monday ' s are always tough .
tr	Ind	Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday .
tr	Ind	It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey .
tr	Ind	See you Sunday .
tr	Ind	Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ).
tr	Ind	These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect .
tr	Ind	We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone .
tr	Ind	Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered .
tr	Ind	The I / C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100 % of design ).
tr	Ind	We will try to complete the I / C with the earliest in - service date possible , but with conditions as they are , a realistic date would be June 15 , 2002 .
tr	Ind	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Ind	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
tr	Ind	Our in - service date is May 1 .

tr	Ind	"Listening to the Edison call w / investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("" big bang "" approach ) sometime in Q1 ' 02 ."
tr	Ind	My concern is that between now and then Dunn , the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief , which could be detrimental to generators / marketers ' claims .
tr	Ind	Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators -- asking about haircuts in particular -- and Edison is side - stepping the questions .
tr	Ind	Figured they ' d contacted them , but wanted to make sure .
tr	Ind	You know when the meeting with schedulers will be ?
tr	Ind	I apologize , I ' m on the road and haven ' t heard when that will be .
tr	Ind	I ' m thinking that I may want to attend .

tr	Ind	"They ' re holding "" workshops "" on how it will all work soon ."
tr	Ind	Electricity : A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president .
tr	Ind	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California ' s energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices .
tr	Ind	"The investigative committee , headed by state Sen . Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : "" the palace coup ."""
tr	Ind	Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state ' s energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis , pushed the state into the power - buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers .
tr	Ind	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Ind	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Ind	""" I don ' t know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort ,"" said Dunn ."
tr	Ind	"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter ."
tr	Ind	""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis ,"" Maviglio said ."
tr	Ind	Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .
tr	Ind	ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn ' s committee will find no criminal conduct .
tr	Ind	The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the lights on .
tr	Ind	At the time , generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps .
tr	Ind	""" It was an emergency ,"" Fishman said ."
tr	Ind	""" We had to take action .''"
tr	Ind	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct . 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .
tr	Ind	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Ind	""" All hell broke loose .''"
tr	Ind	Records show that on Oct . 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .
tr	Ind	The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators .
tr	Ind	""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity ,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III ."
tr	Ind	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .
tr	Ind	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Ind	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Ind	The generators got their way .
tr	Ind	The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .
tr	Ind	What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .
tr	Ind	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they couldn ' t make a profit even under these constraints .
tr	Ind	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Ind	What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .
tr	Ind	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Ind	Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .
tr	Ind	Neither the ISO board , which had established the price cap , nor the governor learned of Winter ' s actions until the cap had been removed .
tr	Ind	In fact , the attorney who helped draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made .
tr	Ind	He didn ' t mention anything about it .
tr	Ind	""" In retrospect , we should have told them ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Ind	With the price caps gone , the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs .
tr	Ind	""" The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor ' s key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment ,'' Maviglio said ."
tr	Ind	""" It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant ."
tr	Ind	"This action accelerated the utilities ' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power - buying business ."""
tr	Ind	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO records show .
tr	Ind	Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $ 30 billion .
tr	Ind	Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians .
tr	Ind	Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .
tr	Ind	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .
tr	Ind	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .
tr	Ind	""" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Ind	""" In our view , we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation ."
tr	Ind	"We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund ."""
tr	Ind	Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .
tr	Ind	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Ind	""" Terry did this by himself ,'' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
tr	Ind	""" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing ."""
tr	Ind	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Ind	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed , but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos , the governor ' s spokesman Maviglio said .
tr	Ind	James J . Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter .
tr	Ind	""" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark ,'' Hoecker said ."
tr	Ind	""" They ( ISO management ) did what any independent system operator would do ."""
tr	Ind	What Dunn ' s committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired .
tr	Ind	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Ind	""" We don ' t know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out ,"" Dunn said ."
tr	Ind	""" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact .''"
tr	Ind	I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA ( for customers already on DA ).
tr	Ind	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .
tr	Ind	Sounds good .
tr	Ind	"I suggest a "" blind draw "" on the teams , best ball not scramble on the golf , and as for the wager , no emails from the losing team for one week !"
tr	Ind	Is there any question ?
tr	Ind	As I recall , Montavano , Shapiro and I usually make up one team , but I ' m willing to switch around a bit .
tr	Ind	Are you playing golf ?
tr	Ind	And if yes , what ' s the game and wager ???
tr	Ind	It ' s a two way street , of course .
tr	Ind	Have they expressed any interest in negotiating ?
tr	Ind	There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation , but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show .
tr	Ind	"Where is the "" simple "" explanation of the transportation piece ?"
tr	Ind	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Ind	Accordingly , the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP ( the only one and therefore the one they have to choose ) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract .
tr	Ind	What say ye ?
tr	Ind	By Friday December 1st , could you please tell me the percentages / amount of time you spent on East Coast Power during the months of October and November .
tr	Ind	In addition , could you look over the list below to see if there are any additional employees in your group that spent time on ECP , so we can ensure we bill all of our used resources to ECP .
tr	Ind	Looks good
tr	Ind	How does this look ?
tr	Ind	If I can get a few minutes with Mark H . today , I ' m going to propose that I speak to Stan Klimberg about getting this signed before Thursday ' s meeting with LIPA .
tr	Ind	In the three years I have been here , I am unaware of an ENA / ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company .
tr	Ind	Justin , I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here .
tr	Ind	I ' ve read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations appropriately .
tr	Ind	Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed ??
tr	Ind	We sued Houston Casualty last year but I don ' t recall making any bad faith claims .
tr	Ind	It settled anyway , a long time ago .
tr	Ind	Did you get my fax on Friday ?
tr	Ind	I guess the questions on which I should like your steer are : ( a ) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference to bad faith proceedings made by United India ?
tr	Ind	( b ) Is it right that Enron has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas ?
tr	Ind	( c ) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you ?
tr	Ind	Not when I was there , but I wasn ' t there the whole time .
tr	Ind	"were you able to discuss the "" bad faith "" proceedings issue yesterday ?"
tr	Ind	If you got the chance today , I should be really grateful if one of you could give me a call to discuss this issue ; I think we should set out DPC ' s position clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay .
tr	Ind	This message is confidential .
tr	Ind	Per my voice mail , here is the letter .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your help .
tr	Ind	Have you heard if the Kinga has had little Brian II yet ?
tr	Ind	Hope your pre Chanukah planning is going well .
tr	Ind	As you can tell from the time of my e - mail , I am getting crushed .
tr	Ind	Now that Michelle is in your fold , do you want to reconsider her being the contact person with AAA on this ?
tr	Ind	I am sending you a letter from their atty .
tr	Ind	As of today , we have not received payment in full as requested in Richard Sanders ' letter dated November 16 , 2000 .
tr	Ind	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Ind	The attached letter is being sent to you from Patricia Gillman .
tr	Ind	I am sending you a letter from their atty .
tr	Ind	As of today , we have not received payment in full as requested in Richard Sanders ' letter dated November 16 , 2000 .
tr	Ind	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Ind	Has Liz finished with gathering the documents ?
tr	Ind	Here are the revised dates for the response / reply / and hearing dates for Enron ' s motion to compel .
tr	Ind	As you may recall , they say they want a deposition on the parties ' intention .
tr	Ind	We should be expecting a deposition notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat .
tr	Ind	I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A & K has filed setting forth the Trustee ' s position in connection with the enforcement / nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the Trustee is seeking .
tr	Ind	As you see below , she is pulling those together .
tr	Ind	Talked to Craig and the Court today .
tr	Ind	The motion to compel is now scheduled for Dec . 12 at 2p . m .
tr	Ind	The trustee ' s oppositon papers are now due Nov 27 and Enron reply is due Dec 1 .
tr	Ind	I have my paralegal gathering the pleadings Enron requested .

tr	Ind	We are still very interested in having Enron support our eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol .?
tr	Ind	We have had enthusiastic responses from companies such as AT & T , Duke Energy , Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler , and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal point for our educational efforts .?
tr	Ind	The real purpose of my call , however , is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational statements of the Protocol .
tr	Ind	I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association ' s dispute management systems and services for eCommerce B2B transactions .?
tr	Ind	At this time we are putting together small working groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service offerings .
tr	Ind	Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from finance , legal , and operations so that we get good cross - functional feedback about our services .?
tr	Ind	We are very concerned with providing services that are relevant to that environment .
tr	Ind	We would like to meet between November 14 and ? December 1 ? since construction of our services is already underway .?
tr	Ind	Do you have a tel # for Mike ?
tr	Ind	I ' ll send a copy of the suit filed against the generators as soon as I get it .
tr	Ind	OK , perhaps it was inevitable .
tr	Ind	But it is now official .
tr	Ind	A team of San Diego ' s best anti - trust and class action attorneys has been assembled to take on the electric generators and marketers in California state court in an effort to return the electricity overcharges that have battered San Diego and the rest of California this year .
tr	Ind	We are hopeful that we can post the complaint to the UCAN web site later today .
tr	Ind	""" Time is the best teacher , except for the fact that it kills off its best students """
tr	Ind	the industry of Marriage and Kids , you heard me .
tr	Ind	Marriage is , in and of itself , a noble concept , but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck .
tr	Ind	How can I say such an abomination , ask you ?
tr	Ind	These are the people who keep Jerry springer on the air .
tr	Ind	These are the kids who will destroy society , because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture , you heard again .
tr	Ind	And you might think by reading this I blame the kids .....
tr	Ind	Not so , Kids are what kids are and will do what they do .
tr	Ind	It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them .
tr	Ind	It ' s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
tr	Ind	Very few parents do this .
tr	Ind	And this is a direct result of the Politically correct , permissive , time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this .
tr	Ind	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .
tr	Ind	People like this will never have my sympathy , nor do they deserve my sympathy .
tr	Ind	Probably it is .
tr	Ind	You made a choice to be a mommy , you dont get a break until they move out , thats the choice that you madea and that ' s life .
tr	Ind	Just because you ' re stuck , doesnt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you .

tr	Ind	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Ind	"Now , NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with "" go "" fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches ."
tr	Ind	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
tr	Ind	I hope so .
tr	Ind	"Seeing another "" Columbia "" incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas )."
tr	Ind	We don ' t need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species .
tr	Ind	"You do have to give NASA credit on some things as they have eliminated the "" fear of reporting failure "" culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the Columbia shuttle ."
tr	Ind	Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems ( as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses ).
tr	Ind	But supporters are pointing a few good things out :
tr	Ind	Clearly , the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel .
tr	Ind	A few weeks ago , shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry .
tr	Ind	One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed .
tr	Ind	"The other is a new fuel tank "" guaranteed "" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation ."
tr	Ind	NASA has some PR hurdles to overcome in the future .
tr	Ind	"In George Orwell ' s influential novel "" 1984 "" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "" war is peace ""."
tr	Ind	I see the merit in flowing with duality .
tr	Ind	One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one , that there is no separation between you and I , we are all together in this thing called life , we human beings , the birds and the tress , the rocks and the sky , all of it .
tr	Ind	I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body , mind and soul .
tr	Ind	Our strength is in our unity and harmony .
tr	Ind	Any major dischord and we all suffer .
tr	Ind	Any insult to the collective good brings us all down .
tr	Ind	Living out of synch with nature is the great disease , from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness .
tr	Ind	We are only as strong as our weakest , we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager .
tr	Ind	When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down .
tr	Ind	When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do , not only are they hurting us , but they are hurting themselves .
tr	Ind	There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
tr	Ind	What you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you .
tr	Ind	We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment , our rejection of the natural for the industrial , and our embrace of violence over peace .
tr	Ind	Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him .
tr	Ind	What are you doing to the least of the people ?
tr	Ind	No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier , we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality .
tr	Ind	There is no health without peace and no peace without health .
tr	Ind	What are you searching for ?
tr	Ind	Whether you are looking for a part - time income to help pay off your debts or you are looking for the freedom offered by working from home on a full time basis , Agel is the vehicle that can make that happen .
tr	Ind	Agel is a new company and is uniquely positioned to be the next giant in the network marketing industry .
tr	Ind	The company has developed an entirely new category of products .

tr	Ind	We now present the kaoshikii dance , which is excellent before and after yoga postures .
tr	Ind	I encourage you to do this dance , as it has tremendous positive effects .
tr	Ind	It is a dance for both males and females .
tr	Ind	Kaoshikii is a dance which was invented in 1978 by Shrii Shrii A ' nandamu ' rti .
tr	Ind	It is a psycho - spiritual exercise and benefiting the mind by developing stamina and strength .
tr	Ind	Kaoshikii is especially good for women .
tr	Ind	It can ward off and cure a number of diseases , keeps the body youthful and enables an easy delivery in childbirth .
tr	Ind	Kaoshikii comes from the Sanskrit word ' kosa ' meaning shell or layer of mind .
tr	Ind	The self of the individual lies hidden in the innermost layers of existence ( kosas ).
tr	Ind	Thus kaoshikii is a blossoming of the microcosm ( unit being ) in its attempt to attain a link with the Macrocosm ( Cosmic Consciousness ).
tr	Ind	This attempt is normally referred to as mysticism .
tr	Ind	Exercises all the glands and limbs from head to toes .
tr	Ind	Increases longevity .
tr	Ind	Makes for easy delivery at childbirth .

tr	Ind	Cures kidney and gall bladder troubles , gastric trouble , dyspepsia , acidity , dysentery , obesity and liver diseases .
tr	Ind	Increases the capacity to work until 75 - 80 years of age .
tr	Ind	The eighteen steps of the dance are done rhythmically .
tr	Ind	First the dancer begins in the starting position : the hands together and raised over the head .
tr	Ind	"Then to the beat of "" dhin , dhin ,... , ta ', ta '"", the dancers begin their step , placing the big toe behind the heel of the other foot ."
tr	Ind	In the final two steps , the dancers firmly stamp their feet on the ground .
tr	Ind	Kaoshikii can be danced for as many rounds as you like .
tr	Ind	"When the dancers start the step with the beat of "" dhin , dhin ..."", the mental ideation should also be kept ."
tr	Ind	Here is the ideation .
tr	Ind	"The two hands when upraised and folded together represent : "" Now I am trying to establish a link with Parama Purus ' a ( Supreme Consciousness )."""
tr	Ind	"Bending to the right indicates : "" I know the right way to request You ."""
tr	Ind	"Bending to the left indicates : "" I know how to fulfil Your demands ."""
tr	Ind	"Bending forward suggests : "" I completely surrender to You ."""
tr	Ind	"Bending backward represents : "" I am ready to face all obstacles that may come ."""
tr	Ind	"The last two steps represent : "" O Lord I repeat Your cosmic rhythm ."""
tr	Ind	Quebecker wins U . S . bravery award
tr	Ind	A Quebec man was awarded a Carnegie Medal for bravery on Monday for saving two friends by fighting off a polar bear with a pocket knife two years ago on Baffin Island
tr	Ind	Dr . Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que ., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two friends who were being mauled .
tr	Ind	""" All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [ River ] valley where we were canoeing ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
tr	Ind	""" My first thought was to push it away ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	""" A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear ' s paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling ."""
tr	Ind	The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears .
tr	Ind	The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack , experts said .
tr	Ind	The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
tr	Ind	""" Their screams changed ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Ind	""" I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out ."""
tr	Ind	The bear dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 Mr . Parenteau , knocking him to the ground , he said .
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier threw a large rock at the bear , distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , who was in the same tent .
tr	Ind	Again Dr . Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
tr	Ind	""" The bear gave chase and I gave chase ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	""" At some point , Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back ."
tr	Ind	"I was beside the bear ' s head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times ."""
tr	Ind	The bear ran off .
tr	Ind	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Ind	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon , however , were bleeding badly .
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement .
tr	Ind	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr . Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr . Fortier said .
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday .
tr	Ind	"The bronze medal is given to people who "" risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others ."""
tr	Ind	The other Canadian recipient of the medal was Ronald Joseph Crawford , 42 , of Hamilton , who was killed Aug . 4 , 2002 , while trying to defend a Hamilton sandwich shop owner from a robber wielding a knife .
tr	Ind	Mr . Crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .
tr	Ind	U . S . industrialist Andrew Carnegie started a hero fund in 1904 after being inspired by rescue stories from a mine disaster that killed 181 people .
tr	Ind	The award comes with a $ 3 , 500 ( U . S .) grant .
tr	Ind	It was the favorite fruit of founder Steve Jobs .
tr	Ind	He was three months late in filing a name for the business , and he threatened to call his company Apple Computers if the other colleagues didn ' t suggest a better name by 5 O ' clock .
tr	Ind	It is not an acronym as popularly believed .
tr	Ind	It is short for San Francisco .
tr	Ind	This name was formed by using COMp , for computer , and PAQ to denote a small integral object .
tr	Ind	The name was derived from the founder ' s name Dr . Michael Cowpland .
tr	Ind	It stands for COwpland REsearch Laboratory .
tr	Ind	The name started as a joke boasting about the amount of information the search - engine would be able to search .
tr	Ind	It was originally named ' Googol ', a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 zeros .
tr	Ind	After founders - Stanford graduate students Sergey Brin and Larry Page presented their project to an angel investor , they received a cheque made out to ' Google '
tr	Ind	Founder Jack Smith got the idea of accessing e - mail via the web from a computer anywhere in the world .
tr	Ind	"When Sabeer Bhatia came up with the business plan for the mail service , he tried all kinds of names ending in ' mail ' and finally settled for hotmail as it included the letters "" html "" - the programming language used to write web pages ."
tr	Ind	It was initially referred to as HoTMaiL with selective uppercasing .
tr	Ind	Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tossed a coin to decidewhether the company they founded would be called Hewlett - Packard or Packard - Hewlett .
tr	Ind	Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore wanted to name their new company ' Moore Noyce ' but that was already trademarked by a hotel chain so they had to settle for an acronym of INTegrated ELectronics .
tr	Ind	Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from ' The Lotus Position ' or ' Padmasana '.
tr	Ind	Kapor used to be a teacher of Transcendental Meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .
tr	Ind	Coined by Bill Gates to represent the company that was devoted to MICROcomputer SOFTware .
tr	Ind	Originally christened Micro - Soft , the '-' was removed later on .
tr	Ind	Founder Paul Galvin came up with this name when his company started manufacturing radios for cars .
tr	Ind	The popular radio company at the time was called Victrola .
tr	Ind	Larry Ellison and Bob Oats were working on a consulting project for the CIA ( Central Intelligence Agency ).
tr	Ind	The code name for the project was called Oracle ( the CIA saw this as the system to give answers to all questions or something such ).
tr	Ind	The project was designed to help use the newly written SQL code by IBM .
tr	Ind	The project eventually was terminated but Larry and Bob decided to finish what they started and bring it to the world .
tr	Ind	They kept the name Oracle and created the RDBMS engine .
tr	Ind	Later they kept the same name for the company .
tr	Ind	It originated from the Latin word ' sonus ' meaning sound , and ' sonny ' a slang used by Americans to refer to a bright youngster .
tr	Ind	Founded by 4 Stanford University buddies , SUN is the acronym for Stanford University Network .
tr	Ind	Andreas Bechtolsheim built a microcomputer ; Vinod Khosla recruited him and Scott McNealy to manufacture computers based on it , and Bill Joy to develop a UNIX - based OS for the computer .
tr	Ind	The word was invented by Jonathan Swift and used in his book ' Gulliver ' s Travels '.
tr	Ind	It represents a person who is repulsive in appearance and action and is barely human .
tr	Ind	Yahoo ! Founders Jerry Yang and DavidFilo selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos ...
tr	Ind	I am on Yahoo !
tr	Ind	There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing Guild Wars , so why create a new one ?
tr	Ind	I say why not ?
tr	Ind	The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it ' s not going to go away .
tr	Ind	I have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason .
tr	Ind	Usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used .
tr	Ind	That said , the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :).
tr	Ind	I ' m nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions .
tr	Ind	Im really looking forward to Guild Wars .
tr	Ind	Feb 2005 is the projected release date , although Guild Wars is made by ex - members of Blizzard , so Feb 2005 could mean August 2006 ...
tr	Ind	Anyway , I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I missed out on 2 / 3 weekend events .
tr	Ind	Oh well , I ' ll get it when it comes out in Febuary .
tr	Ind	rumor has feb 05 on the calender .
tr	Ind	BUT they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long .
tr	Ind	I was kind of curious , what exactly is Guild Wars ?
tr	Ind	I havn ' t heard of it .
tr	Ind	It ' s a massive multiplayer role playing game .
tr	Ind	The graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics I have ever seen for any game and I have been gaming since the MUD days .
tr	Ind	It ' s worth a look .
tr	Ind	I have a preorder and am even considering getting a second preorder to have multiple accounts .
tr	Ind	I have participated in all the weekend beta events and the world preview .
tr	Ind	The game is already 100 % functional .
tr	Ind	I am Lady Kingel and I hail from the United Legit Gaming Guilds of Guild Wars .
tr	Ind	We are a consortium of legit honorable guilds that was established in 1997 for DI and we are now adding GW to the list of games played .
tr	Ind	The alliance is a pretty straightforward one .
tr	Ind	It was formed to allow many different guilds who were all strictly honorable to come together as a family and allow them many people to game with .
tr	Ind	There are no other requirements other than we ask that members greet each new member and each new alliance and also feel free to post in any of the forums .
tr	Ind	We are also a group who is looking for members for our own select guild called ULGG of GW ... which is a part of the alliance with the same name .
tr	Ind	We play in all aspects of the game and we hand pick our members .
tr	Ind	You are individuals of quality , and in our alliance we seek quality of member over quantity of member .
tr	Ind	I do hope to see you visiting us at the fire and we shall prepare a feast for you , as well .
tr	Ind	If you paste this in your browser , it will take you directly to our GW website .
tr	Ind	I extend my hand to each of you in true friendship , and honor .
tr	Ind	We are currently moving to a new server , so we will be down for a while .
tr	Ind	I will inform when we are up and running again .
tr	Ind	I wish all happy holidays , and moreso , peace on earth .
tr	Ind	We are here .
tr	Ind	Like it or not , for good or bad , we are here .
tr	Ind	Who are we ?
tr	Ind	We are the downtrodden and dispossesed , the self - torturing , the disenfranchised convicts , drug and alcohol addicts , the unemployed and unemployable .
tr	Ind	We are the children of poverty , financial and spiritual .
tr	Ind	We have and will have children of our own , grandchildren too .
tr	Ind	We are ex - cons , uninsured , homeless , of many colors and speaking many tongues .
tr	Ind	We are the enemy in what has become a domestic war against ourselves .
tr	Ind	And who are you ?
tr	Ind	You who like the tough talk of Tough on Crime ?
tr	Ind	You who watch as budgets are cut in education and health care while you militarize a police force ?
tr	Ind	Bullet - proof vests , automatic weapons , helicopters , tanks , robots ... the testosterone is oozing through the streets , more prisons , longer sentences , tighten the belt , spartan conditions , task forces , gang units , gun courts .
tr	Ind	And what is there to show for it ?
tr	Ind	"Unemployent stays low because half the population oversees those "" out of the workforce "", the dregs , the rabble , the enemy ?"
tr	Ind	Do you feel safer ?
tr	Ind	Do you live in a gated community or gentrified neighborhood ?
tr	Ind	By the way , have you read the Declaration of Independence and US Constitution - or do you only know the first phrases ?
tr	Ind	It ' s about time we got together .
tr	Ind	Most of us still have hope for ourselves even when stuck in the darkest dilemmas , ruts and catch - 22s .
tr	Ind	Most of us believe in crafting laws and instilling order .
tr	Ind	Many of us have burrowed beneath the surface to find a spiritual sense of being , an understanding force at least as powerful as those we succumbed to , and many of use wouldn ' t escape if you opened the front door .
tr	Ind	Did you know that approximately 10 million Americans are either incarcerated , on probation , on parole or once were in those categories ?
tr	Ind	Each of those 10 million have families , friends , neighbors ... and so closer and closer does the We interface with the You .
tr	Ind	Don ' t you think it ' s time we talked ?
tr	Ind	Are you ready ?
tr	Ind	Can you accept that the road we are travelling points toward a grim and painful future ?
tr	Ind	Do you have the heart to face monumental failures while bravely struggling beyond where we are now ?
tr	Ind	I know that some of you are , and that some of us are , and this is what gives me hope .
tr	Ind	You need our insights just as we need your structure .
tr	Ind	It is never over , especially when a real solution , a real treatment for our sickness , is yet to begin .
tr	Ind	P . S . - I am trying to conceptualize an effective guerilla media campaign to promote this cause .
tr	Ind	Ideas are welcome .
tr	Ind	Collaboration is prayed .
tr	Ind	There are a couple of packages available through the supporters of the comp . sources . unix archives .
tr	Ind	Information on archive sites , and indices of comp . sources . unix back issues are posted regularly in comp . sources . unix and comp . sources . d .
tr	Ind	"Subject : What is "" food for the NSA line - eater ""?"
tr	Ind	This refers to the alleged scanning of all Usenet traffic by the National Security Agency ( and possibly other intelligence organizations ) for interesting keywords .

tr	Ind	I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH , son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush , and currently serving as President of the United States of America .
tr	Ind	This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by correspondence .
tr	Ind	I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence .
tr	Ind	I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
tr	Ind	My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
tr	Ind	In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my father , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran .
tr	Ind	This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U . S .- British subsidiary .
tr	Ind	My father re - secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U . S . dollars ($ 61 , 000 , 000 , 000 ).
tr	Ind	Out of that cost , thirty - six billion dollars ($ 36 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) were supplied by King Hussein , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies , and sixteen billion dollars ($ 16 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) by German and Japanese partners .
tr	Ind	But my father ' s former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
tr	Ind	My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($ 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 ), both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
tr	Ind	That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance .
tr	Ind	Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice - president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
tr	Ind	I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
tr	Ind	I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried .
tr	Ind	But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day .
tr	Ind	A bold step taken shall not be regretted , I assure you .
tr	Ind	I pray that you understand our plight .
tr	Ind	US battles to save storm victims
tr	Ind	Emergency teams in the southern US are battling to reach survivors of Hurricane Katrina , the most destructive storm to hit the country in decades .
tr	Ind	Hundreds of people are feared dead in Mississippi , and the Louisiana city of New Orleans is badly flooded .
tr	Ind	The city mayor said rescuers were unable to retrieve the dead .
tr	Ind	""" They ' re just pushing them aside ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	Amid worsening conditions , officials plan to evacuate a New Orleans stadium where up to 20 , 000 people took shelter .
tr	Ind	The Superdome stadium is without power , and toilets are overflowing .
tr	Ind	""" It ' s a very , very desperate situation ,"" Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco said ."
tr	Ind	[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
tr	Ind	"One resident of New Orleans said escaping from the storm was "" hell ""."
tr	Ind	""" We were screaming , hollering , flashing lights ."
tr	Ind	"It was complete chaos ,"" Kioka Williams told the Associated Press news agency ."
tr	Ind	She had to hack her way through the ceiling of her beauty shop as flood waters rose in the city of half a million people - much of which lies below sea level .
tr	Ind	Walls keeping water out of the bowl - shaped city have been breached , and emergency teams are using helicopters to drop 1 , 350kg ( 3 , 000lb ) sandbags and concrete barriers into the gaps .
tr	Ind	Before the phones went , I was told [ my family in Biloxi ] had lost their roof , barn , 2 oak trees and many pines and they were letting in water
tr	Ind	New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin said up to 80 % of the city was submerged , in some cases by waters 6m ( 20ft ) deep .
tr	Ind	He warned water levels could still rise .
tr	Ind	""" Some sections of the city which are dry now could see nine or 10 feet ( some 3m ) of water ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	The US Army Corps of Engineers says it could take a month to clear the flood waters , and the government ' s disaster relief agency has urged evacuees not to try to get back to their homes .
tr	Ind	The BBC ' s Alastair Leithead in New Orleans says there is panic as vital supplies run out .
tr	Ind	Heavily armed police have been trying to impose a form of martial law to stem outbreaks of looting .
tr	Ind	While some looters are stealing non - essential goods , others are simply trying to find food and water .
tr	Ind	The situation appears to be even worse in Mississippi .
tr	Ind	""" You ' re going to be looking at hundreds dead along the coast ,"" a state official said ."
tr	Ind	[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
tr	Ind	Casinos housed in barges have been hurled onto the beach and beyond .
tr	Ind	Tens of thousands are homeless , and officials say it could be weeks before power is restored .
tr	Ind	""" I can only imagine that this is what Hiroshima looked like 60 years ago ,"" said Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour after viewing the destruction from the air ."
tr	Ind	Survivors are being found all the time , including two children who lost their parents .
tr	Ind	Harrison County in Mississippi bore the brunt of Hurricane Katrina as it slammed into Biloxi and Gulfport before heading inland .
tr	Ind	Mississippi media earlier reported 54 people killed in the state .
tr	Ind	"In Biloxi , 30 people were reported dead in one block of flats which was hit by a 9m ( 30ft ) "" storm surge ""."
tr	Ind	"The town ' s death toll may be "" in the hundreds "", municipal spokesman Vincent Creel said ."
tr	Ind	Louisiana ' s Governor Blanco urged residents to spend Wednesday in prayer and assured them the crisis would eventually be overcome .
tr	Ind	The US Red Cross has mobilised thousands of volunteers for its biggest - ever natural disaster effort and federal emergency teams are being dispatched to affected areas .
tr	Ind	President George W Bush , who has cut his holiday two days short , has called on Americans to donate to the Red Cross or other organisations .
tr	Ind	Damage estimates of more than $ 25bn suggest it could be the US insurance industry ' s most expensive natural disaster ever .
tr	Ind	The price of crude oil on the international market hit a record $ 70 . 85 a barrel due to the vulnerability of oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico .
tr	Ind	The US energy secretary has announced that oil will be released from government petroleum reserves .

tr	Ind	Also , from their own webpage , reasons why NASA is important , in a 5th grade format .
tr	Ind	I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
tr	Ind	Also NASA has a large outreach program for education , some people believe this is important .
tr	Ind	Subject : Re : NASA IS A WASTE ! From : jaqamofino - ga on 26 Apr 2005 06 : 02 PDT
tr	Ind	i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers ' money , but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies , that i find it best not to think about it .
tr	Ind	i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste , but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA .
tr	Ind	of course , in a perfect world , tax payers ' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program , and housing for the homeless , but this is far from a perfect world .
tr	Ind	in response to Steve ' s comment : do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone ?
tr	Ind	i find that extremely hard to believe .
tr	Ind	i think it could have been done in a much more cost efficient way , right here on bad - old - planet - earth .
tr	Ind	I realize that it may sound strange , but we are desparate in our efforts and are willing to try anything to help our dear sick friend .
tr	Ind	This costs absolutely nothing , and will take about one minute of your time .

tr	Ind	China ' s insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
tr	Ind	An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China ' s soaring economic growth .
tr	Ind	Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol
tr	Ind	The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .
tr	Ind	"The submarine incident was put down to a "" technical error "" by the Chinese government , which apologised to Japan ."
tr	Ind	"But even before the incident the People ' s Daily , the government mouthpiece , had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "" only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy ""."
tr	Ind	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .
tr	Ind	The West , however , has paid little attention to these developments .
tr	Ind	"For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China ' s relations with "" pariah states ""."
tr	Ind	In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur .
tr	Ind	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .
tr	Ind	Then , this month , it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran ' s nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
tr	Ind	A week before , China ' s second biggest state oil firm had signed a $ 70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran , which already supplies 13 per cent of China ' s needs .
tr	Ind	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Ind	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Ind	This year it overtook Japan as the world ' s second largest consumer of energy , behind the US .
tr	Ind	Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .
tr	Ind	Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities .
tr	Ind	"Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to "" go abroad "" to ensure supply , they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border ."
tr	Ind	Japan protested , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .
tr	Ind	The two are also set to clash over Russia ' s oil wealth .
tr	Ind	China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East .
tr	Ind	Japan favoured a route to the sea , enabling oil to be shipped to both Japan and China .
tr	Ind	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Ind	Increasingly , analysts are saying that China ' s efforts have gone beyond what is safe or even in its own interests .
tr	Ind	Claude Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly worth the trouble .
tr	Ind	""" Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	""" It may be a difficult political issue but I don ' t think the energy content is worthwhile ."""
tr	Ind	Eurasia Group , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price .
tr	Ind	""" If China ' s economy falters , which , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity prices will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets that produce them ,"" Jason Kindopp , Eurasia ' s lead China analyst , said ."
tr	Ind	""" Beijing may end up in a early 1990s Japan situation , where it is forced to sell recently purchased overseas assets for a fraction of what it paid for them ."""
tr	Ind	China ' s wider aggression to secure oil and gas was the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade .
tr	Ind	""" Sudan is the primary example ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	""" It marks the first time in recent years that China has promised to wield its veto power in the UN Security Council against a petition initiated by the United States and backed by France and Great Britain ."""
tr	Ind	Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that .
tr	Ind	Meditation has to do with what is called ideation .
tr	Ind	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Ind	With each breath , feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter , and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness .
tr	Ind	As you sit above the world , the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer .
tr	Ind	It surrounds you .
tr	Ind	The golden rays feel soft and soothing .
tr	Ind	Now you are far above the earth - into space .
tr	Ind	Everything around you is so vast .
tr	Ind	Yet , there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness .
tr	Ind	You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you .
tr	Ind	Your muscles are loose and limp .
tr	Ind	The sun ' s rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .
tr	Ind	You are in a state of peace and relaxation .
tr	Ind	You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
tr	Ind	A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
tr	Ind	"Its meaning is "" Infinite happiness is everywhere ""."
tr	Ind	This is called ideation .
tr	Ind	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Ind	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
tr	Ind	Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process .
tr	Ind	You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity .
tr	Ind	OK that is fairly basic :).
tr	Ind	The important point is to develop some psycho - spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
tr	Ind	It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
tr	Ind	The main thing is to keep practicing .
tr	Ind	If you don ' t practice , then nothing happens .
tr	Ind	From what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage .
tr	Ind	But that ’ s not the case .
tr	Ind	Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same - gender couples .
tr	Ind	One of “ NCRC4ME ’ s ” major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached “ Declaration of Religious Leaders ,” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature .
tr	Ind	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Ind	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real need for visible support for the “ pro - same - gender - marriage ” side of this issue .
tr	Ind	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .
tr	Ind	Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration .
tr	Ind	Furthermore , the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration .
tr	Ind	( Since the Declaration is written as coming from “ religious leaders ,” people who don ’ t consider themselves “ religious leaders ” can sign as “ Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality .”)
tr	Ind	Thank you for your consideration of this issue .
tr	Ind	The most fundamental human right , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings .
tr	Ind	We become most fully human when we love another person .
tr	Ind	"This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "" secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity .”"
tr	Ind	"The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “ inalienable rights ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness ."""
tr	Ind	Throughout history , tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families , they can kill the spirit of those peoples .
tr	Ind	> From the shameful history of slavery in America , the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right .
tr	Ind	The American laws forbidding interracial marriage , now struck down , were clearly discriminatory .
tr	Ind	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Ind	We feel called to protest and oppose this injustice .
tr	Ind	As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life .
tr	Ind	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
tr	Ind	As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
tr	Ind	We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
tr	Ind	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
tr	Ind	However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
tr	Ind	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .
tr	Ind	We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter .
tr	Ind	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Ind	Likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Ind	As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
tr	Ind	As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .
tr	Ind	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Ind	A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http :// loveallpeople . org / usconstitutiona . txt
tr	Ind	Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :
tr	Ind	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Ind	He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
tr	Ind	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Ind	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
tr	Ind	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Ind	His co - workers love him .
tr	Ind	His fellow judges love him .
tr	Ind	His family loves him .
tr	Ind	President Bush loves him .
tr	Ind	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Ind	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Ind	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan . 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
tr	Ind	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Ind	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Ind	"There is an old saying that applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure ."""
tr	Ind	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Ind	In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
tr	Ind	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
tr	Ind	"But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President ."
tr	Ind	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .
tr	Ind	""" Commander In Chief "" doesn ' t mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
tr	Ind	Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .
tr	Ind	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Ind	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .
tr	Ind	AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .

tr	Ind	Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath .
tr	Ind	"Country has an Independent strategy = NASA & company to use "" Numero Uno "" strategy , try to assert , beat , mesh and control the space program of the country ."
tr	Ind	"Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA & Company to use "" freeze thawed "" strategy especially when the country has a challenging , growing and ambitious space program ."
tr	Ind	This is really an end goal aim of NASA & Company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon landing hoax .
tr	Ind	China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
tr	Ind	Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program ' s goals
tr	Ind	China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China ' s Gansu Province .
tr	Ind	A pair of military pilots embarked on China ' s second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days .
tr	Ind	The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China ' s official news agency .
tr	Ind	The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
tr	Ind	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Ind	Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .
tr	Ind	But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
tr	Ind	President Bush has directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers .
tr	Ind	"China ' s "" is not a fly - by - night program ,"" said Joan Johnson - Freese , an expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R . I ."
tr	Ind	""" They are not in any hurry ."
tr	Ind	"They want a program that will be a success ,"" Johnson - Freese said ."
tr	Ind	""" They are not going to rush it , because they don ' t want it to be a budget buster ."
tr	Ind	China ' s overtures to join the U . S .- led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country ' s human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat .
tr	Ind	The freeze thawed some after Yang ' s 2003 mission .
tr	Ind	China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush ' s strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destinations .
tr	Ind	""" We applaud China ' s space achievements ,"" NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday ."
tr	Ind	""" We wish them a successful return of their astronauts ."""
tr	Ind	He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week ' s Chinese mission through formal channels .
tr	Ind	At present , there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel said .
tr	Ind	The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese said .
tr	Ind	The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi - compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
tr	Ind	At least one expert believes China ' s intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA ' s planned lunar return .
tr	Ind	""" The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly ,"" said John E . Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va .- based GlobalSecurity . org , a small national security think tank ."
tr	Ind	""" There is always the possibility they could jam us up , make us look like we are not numero uno ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Ind	During the U . S . and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays .
tr	Ind	As it turned out , the Soviets never made it to the moon .
tr	Ind	"""( China ) could be the second country to do that ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Ind	Pike ' s concern is based on China ' s development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea .
tr	Ind	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .
tr	Ind	I ' m a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
tr	Ind	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Ind	"The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their "" product "" as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love ."
tr	Ind	Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
tr	Ind	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Ind	Right now , while we ' re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
tr	Ind	The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust .
tr	Ind	I am serious about doing something .
tr	Ind	If I love cats so much , why aren ' t I DOING something ???
tr	Ind	I don ' t want to appear before God on judgment day and have to explain why I didn ' t do anything like this in my life .
tr	Ind	Here ' s the text of the email :
tr	Ind	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Ind	"Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats "" Meowing ,"" I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture ."
tr	Ind	I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
tr	Ind	I ' ve pasted the email for those who haven ' t seen or would like to re - read it .
tr	Ind	It ' s also got the website where the song has been uploaded .
tr	Ind	I was thinking , that while I ' m sitting here , relaxing and enjoying myself , those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust - esque death chambers .
tr	Ind	And what am I DOING about it ?
tr	Ind	"This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure if any of you know much about civet cats , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles .
tr	Ind	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Ind	"The quote is from an article entitled "" Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem '"""
tr	Ind	But this is what he says about civet cats :
tr	Ind	Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds , where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires .
tr	Ind	They are confined in this way until they finally die .
tr	Ind	What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment ?
tr	Ind	These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume .
tr	Ind	Musk , which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive , makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application .
tr	Ind	"( The heat increases their "" production "" of musk .)"
tr	Ind	"Here Kant ' s rule --"" Animals are merely means to an end ; that end is man ""-- is applied with a vengeance ."
tr	Ind	"To promote one of the most trivial interests we have , thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives ."""
tr	Ind	This article , and specifically this piece , effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic .
tr	Ind	If anyone is interested in listening to this song , and in offering their opinion , whether it be positive or negative , I ' d appreciate it .
tr	Ind	But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download , especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine ( 28k ).
tr	Ind	The url for the song is http :// www . sonic . net /~ fsjob / TragiCore - TheCivetCat . mp3
tr	Ind	Although there are no human vocals / lyrics , I think it ' s subject matter is audible .
tr	Ind	It ' s also on the net .
tr	Ind	I was already a vegetarian when I read it a little more than a year ago , but it was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan .
tr	Ind	I hope all are well .

tr	Ind	Blue Planet : Who ' s afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?
tr	Ind	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Ind	In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan ' s Lake Superior .
tr	Ind	The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
tr	Ind	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Ind	After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .
tr	Ind	Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .
tr	Ind	In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .
tr	Ind	If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .
tr	Ind	Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
tr	Ind	If true , the caper failed .
tr	Ind	Over time , the wolf ' s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
tr	Ind	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Ind	This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .
tr	Ind	These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .
tr	Ind	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Ind	Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .
tr	Ind	"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf ' s relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
tr	Ind	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
tr	Ind	Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
tr	Ind	""" All you have to do is look at the photographs ,"" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI ' s Blue Planet ,"
tr	Ind	""" You say , ' wow !'"
tr	Ind	"An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow ."""
tr	Ind	This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .
tr	Ind	More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver , for instance .
tr	Ind	Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park ' s northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .
tr	Ind	""" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people ,"" Beschta told Blue Planet ."
tr	Ind	""" There ' s a lot of impact on plants and they say , ' Who cares ?'"
tr	Ind	But we ' ve been looking at streamside communities .
tr	Ind	Since wolf recovery , streamside plants , willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing shrubs that bears can use .
tr	Ind	It ' s important with regard to the quality of streams .
tr	Ind	The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability .
tr	Ind	"Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems ."""
tr	Ind	Yellowstone has a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .
tr	Ind	Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
tr	Ind	""" I ' m pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations ,"" however , he cautioned ."
tr	Ind	""" Wolves are still pretty new ."
tr	Ind	They ' ve only been there for 10 years .
tr	Ind	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal ' s status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
tr	Ind	Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .
tr	Ind	Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .
tr	Ind	On Jan . 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E . Jones appeared to agree with them .
tr	Ind	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf ' s status .
tr	Ind	Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
tr	Ind	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Ind	A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home .
tr	Ind	"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic ."""
tr	Ind	There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31 , 000 mountain lions .
tr	Ind	Pound for pound , mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves .
tr	Ind	They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
tr	Ind	Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .
tr	Ind	It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
tr	Ind	They seem to be just that : rumors .
tr	Ind	True , there are about 300 , 000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .
tr	Ind	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Ind	Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .
tr	Ind	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .

tr	Ind	Climate : Humans fuss , animals adjust
tr	Ind	Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends , but meanwhile Earth ' s plants , insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome .
tr	Ind	They already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening .
tr	Ind	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non - human natural world to changing conditions , and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming .
tr	Ind	Nina Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61 - year uninterrupted phenological records .
tr	Ind	Phenology studies an organism ' s development and life cycle -- the pulse of life .
tr	Ind	Bradley ' s record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999 , spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data .
tr	Ind	Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier .
tr	Ind	The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to .
tr	Ind	The forest phlox is blooming in late April instead of mid - May .
tr	Ind	Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming .
tr	Ind	In England , the cuckoo returns earlier .
tr	Ind	An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one - third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago .
tr	Ind	""" One of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities ,"" concluded a report titled "" Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States ,"" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week ."
tr	Ind	Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology .
tr	Ind	""" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change ,"" said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world ' s leading experts on this issue ."
tr	Ind	These changes are occurring across all species , Parmesan told UPI ' s Climate .
tr	Ind	""" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding ,"" she said ."
tr	Ind	Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .
tr	Ind	Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat .
tr	Ind	""" Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver ,"" she said ."
tr	Ind	""" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable ."""
tr	Ind	According to Parmesan ' s earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .
tr	Ind	"Throughout the United States , she said , "" spring is about two weeks earlier ."
tr	Ind	Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier .
tr	Ind	Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .
tr	Ind	"Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many , many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean ."""
tr	Ind	"As the Pew report concluded , "" Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U . S . ecosystems ."""
tr	Ind	Such consequences include shifting and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems .
tr	Ind	The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .
tr	Ind	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""
tr	Ind	"The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "" Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ."""
tr	Ind	The ACIA -- with participation by the United States , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000 .
tr	Ind	""" The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic ,"" said ACIA chair Robert Corell ."
tr	Ind	""" The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth ."
tr	Ind	"The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come ."""
tr	Ind	The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years .
tr	Ind	Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the assessment found , with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice .
tr	Ind	""" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction ,"" the report concluded ."
tr	Ind	As with so much climate research , not everyone agrees with these dire predictions .
tr	Ind	"A third report , "" The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future ,"" completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category ."
tr	Ind	"On the one hand , the IPN report agreed "" Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise ."
tr	Ind	"This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase ."""
tr	Ind	On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .
tr	Ind	""" The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge ,"" the IPN report said ."
tr	Ind	""" A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic ."""
tr	Ind	The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster .
tr	Ind	Important species that probably would decline include shrimp , capelin , Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish .
tr	Ind	Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate .
tr	Ind	The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non - commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .
tr	Ind	The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears , checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables .
tr	Ind	The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument .
tr	Ind	They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non - commercial species , and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy .
tr	Ind	This tug - of - war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans , because animals and plants can adjust only so much .

tr	Ind	How has Katrina changed the US ?
tr	Ind	Relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people while authorities have vowed to restore security in New Orleans following a breakdown of law and order .
tr	Ind	In the world press , commentators predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad , especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed .
tr	Ind	Meanwhile , President George W Bush has said he will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled .
tr	Ind	How has Katrina changed the US ?
tr	Ind	Has it altered your life ?
tr	Ind	Has the disaster affected the way other countries view the US ?
tr	Ind	""" As an American , I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the ' USA and Bush Bashers ' that I am appalled at the number of ' allies ' that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions ."

tr	Ind	It is always interesting what spin the press will take .
tr	Ind	I don ' t believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news .
tr	Ind	I have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery .
tr	Ind	Yes , she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country .
tr	Ind	Her husband became a citizen of the US just the week before last .
tr	Ind	( Believe it or not , it takes a minimum of 5 years to apply .)
tr	Ind	The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations .
tr	Ind	You know , I ' ve lived in the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life .
tr	Ind	When not in Texas , I lived in LA and San Francisco .
tr	Ind	There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and I ' ve vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi , and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white ( less than 20 %) in northeastern Arkansas .
tr	Ind	The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t expect to react that way , but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else looked pretty much like me , it was really very eerie .
tr	Ind	So , yes , America has pockets that are more diverse than others .
tr	Ind	Additionally , reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes , you ' ll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , those left behind to be filmed , where those without transportation or means .
tr	Ind	Some refused to leave , but so many were unable to .
tr	Ind	Yes , it ' s a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .
tr	Ind	However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know if this will change other nation ' s perceptions of America .
tr	Ind	I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
tr	Ind	I do know that this will change the face of America .
tr	Ind	I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
tr	Ind	The 1 . 25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin to populate Houston , Dallas , San Antonio and Galveston , and the surrounding areas .
tr	Ind	Sure , some will return , but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing , they may be shy about returning .
tr	Ind	I ' m interested in what America will look like in 5 years .
tr	Ind	Will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs there ?
tr	Ind	Or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives ?
tr	Ind	Will the housing market in Dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx of buyers ?
tr	Ind	Will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast ?
tr	Ind	These are some of the things I ' ve been wondering ...
tr	Ind	Your reply is good and deserves something good in return .
tr	Ind	Okay , I ' m new to this forum and really don ' t like Bush , so my view point is slanted and I admit that .
tr	Ind	I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what ' s the point ?
tr	Ind	What I know is that I have a close friend who ' s aunt disappeared in New Orleans .
tr	Ind	My friend didn ' t have computer capability , so I spent the day searching and posting online .
tr	Ind	The family here ( California ) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA , so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there .
tr	Ind	The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names .
tr	Ind	The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available .
tr	Ind	It is Oct . 6 , and not one family member has been located .
tr	Ind	What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation .
tr	Ind	What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he didn ' t order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
tr	Ind	When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become ?
tr	Ind	Recently , Bush addressed the nation .
tr	Ind	About 30 seconds into his address , he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time .
tr	Ind	Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk .
tr	Ind	Even he can ' t believe that he is trotting out this old saw again .
tr	Ind	I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once , you can ' t help but trot it out every time your act is going sour .
tr	Ind	Meanwhile , every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again .
tr	Ind	The gall of it all is that Bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries , when what he should do is pour money into making the US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together .
tr	Ind	"We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "" FREEDOM "" why not spend those billions making all of us free ?"
tr	Ind	Free of polution , free of oil dependency , and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good ( theirs ).
tr	Ind	I ' m sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off .
tr	Ind	In the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave .

tr	Ind	""" Ay ,"" said Sancho ; "" it must be that some of your worship ' s shrewdness sticks to me ; land that , of itself , is barren and dry , will come to yield good fruit if you dung it and till it >>"
tr	Ind	Of all Freemason sponsered revolutions : American , French , Bolivar , etc . . . Garibaldi ' s is the most blatantly Masonic :
tr	Ind	<< After having written so far , Don Martin Decoud , the exotic dandy of the Parisian boulevard , got up and walked across the sanded floor of the cafe at one end of the Albergo of United Italy , kept by Giorgio Viola , the old companion of Garibaldi .
tr	Ind	The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly , in the light of one candle , at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations .
tr	Ind	Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading from the waters over the land , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . .
tr	Ind	He turned away .
tr	Ind	He could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare , which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss .
tr	Ind	. . . and uneasy in its corporate expression , was overtopped by the big face of Don Juste Lopez , soft and white , with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud .>>
tr	Ind	<< He could do little during the day , for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas , or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
tr	Ind	At night , however , he slept alone , and the avenger might find him .
tr	Ind	On a certain evening , which had been prearranged , I sent my friend final instructions , for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room .
tr	Ind	I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed .
tr	Ind	""" But everything went wrong with us ."
tr	Ind	In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez , the secretary .
tr	Ind	He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note .
tr	Ind	He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress .
tr	Ind	Finally , after much debate , they concluded that my murder was too dangerous .
tr	Ind	But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia .
tr	Ind	They had gagged me , and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address .
tr	Ind	I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia .
tr	Ind	Lopez addressed the note which I had written , sealed it with his sleeve - link , and sent it by the hand of the servant , Jose .
tr	Ind	How they murdered him I do not know , save that it was Murillo ' s hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .
tr	Ind	I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed .
tr	Ind	At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar ; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks .
tr	Ind	The Rock revolution happened in the Sixties ( 6 , number of the Beast ).
tr	Ind	"It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith ( also from Liverpool ): "" Not even God can sink my ship "" ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool )."
tr	Ind	The Rock revolution came from the nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addicts , homosexuals and lunatics ( as that of George Martin , ally of the Beatles ).
tr	Ind	It came from the nation whose king Enrique VIII adulterated the Bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom God provided a wife with six fingers as abomination ( Anne Boleyn )... once again 6 , number of the Beast ....
tr	Ind	"It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "" the Devil ' s Island ""."
tr	Ind	"As the epithet of the government of Satan on that nation , the center of London , the so well - known Piccadilly Circus , takes it ' s name from an old brothel ( the "" Piccadilla House "" which means "" The House of Sin ""), disappeared nowadays ."
tr	Ind	The antichrist John Lennon , one of the Devil ' s main puppets to destroy family , social and moral values and to begin the disintegration of mankind , did hit Stuart Sutcliffe ( the first bass player of the Beatles ) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg .
tr	Ind	Some months later Sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon ' s bruises .
tr	Ind	John Lennon entered stardom being a murderer .
tr	Ind	"The same demons that made captain Smith say "" Not even God can sink my ship "" spoke from antichrist John Lennon ( from Liverpool , base port to the Titanic ) saying : "" Christianity is on the go ."
tr	Ind	"We are more popular than Jesus and Pope ""...."
tr	Ind	That was the day that GOD ' S CURSE fell upon the world of Rock .
tr	Ind	One week after that declaration , ONLY ONE WEEK LATER , Brian Epstein , forger of the Beatle farce , died from an overdose .
tr	Ind	From then on , the Beatles began to get involved in false religions and to preach them to the world .
tr	Ind	"John Lennon ' s divorce followed , as well as his entering the world of black magic , as deeply as to buy the apartment . where the "" Rosemary ' s baby "" had been filmed , previous property of Roman Polansky , and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations ."
tr	Ind	"Came the disintegration of the Beatles ' minds with LSD which has caused , among others , schizophrenic lyrics such as "" I am the Walrus "" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "" Revolution number 9 ""."
tr	Ind	"At the same time , the devil acted through his other main puppets with "" Sympathy for the devil "" that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ), murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin ."
tr	Ind	"Antichrist John Lennon followed the Devil ' s strategy writing lyrics such as "" God is a concept by which we measure our pain ... I don ' t believe in Jesus , etc ., etc .,"" ( God ) and "" and no religions too ..."" ( Imagine )."
tr	Ind	"Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "" Peace "", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of "" The ballad of John and Yoko "": "" the way things are going , they ' re going to crucify me ..."", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine ( today condensed in the "" Lennon remembers "" book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming "" whatever is up there "" for it ( referring to God )."
tr	Ind	The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead .
tr	Ind	It is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times , being seven , as well as three , the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition ....
tr	Ind	"After George Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : "" I want to talk about the divinity of man "", he was given throat cancer by GOD because of those words , which made metastasis and carried on to final death .."
tr	Ind	"To Paul McCartney whose company ' s logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "" Sir "" ( when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir , as long as he produces money for the nation ), GOD provided cancer to the wife ."
tr	Ind	"The advertising farce of how much he loved Linda ( woman whose quality he did not deserve ), was exposed when it was known that Paul had an affair with Heather Mills , Linda ' s intimate friend , with whom McCartney went on a trip to New York and to whom he bought things and presents , while he was still mourning for his "" dear Linda ""."
tr	Ind	At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda ' s death for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity .
tr	Ind	Paul was going out with Heather , but in front of the audience he played the faithful husband ' s masquerade pretending to suffer for Linda , for the afore mentioned promotional ends .
tr	Ind	Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he didn ' t say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much .
tr	Ind	"The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality , he grew the beard that we see in the "" Let it Be "" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film , doing every effort he could to be seen as a man ...."
tr	Ind	"It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : "" I ' ve got a feeling , a feeling I can ' t hide ..."" in front of Yoko in the film ."
tr	Ind	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Ind	Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg , so that he could stand out , being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again , as Jane and Linda did .
tr	Ind	This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
tr	Ind	He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness .
tr	Ind	Besides being a murderer , John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern , trauma from which he never recovered .
tr	Ind	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."
tr	Ind	The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism .
tr	Ind	One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono .
tr	Ind	That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be .
tr	Ind	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Ind	"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" they advise black Joe to "" get back to where you once belonged "", as if England was not a place for black people ."
tr	Ind	Sometimes back , Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles .
tr	Ind	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .
tr	Ind	The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George ' s house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from .
tr	Ind	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Ind	It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him .
tr	Ind	Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other .
tr	Ind	Paul McCartney said that George Harrison is a nothing .
tr	Ind	George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon ....
tr	Ind	"George Harrison said in a video that "" Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn ' t be playing at all "", all of it being the truth , but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians , if musicians at all , who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis ."
tr	Ind	"The Beatles of the times of the "" Cavern "" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin ."
tr	Ind	Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic , and he does lots of charity , thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife ' s life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic .
tr	Ind	He thinks he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived .
tr	Ind	Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people .
tr	Ind	"After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "" Devil ' s Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc ., etc .,"
tr	Ind	The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve , was because the forces of Satan were behind everything , supporting the process .
tr	Ind	This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil ' s Island .
tr	Ind	If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house , it is because you own some L . P , CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones .
tr	Ind	We recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the Devil ' s main nine puppets ....
tr	Ind	You have been warned ...
tr	Ind	The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran .
tr	Ind	""" The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year , according to German media reports , reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media ,"" reported UPI on December 30th ."
tr	Ind	""" The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week ,"" continued UPI , "" quoted ' NATO intelligence sources ' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah - led regime into line , including military options ."
tr	Ind	"This ' all options are open ' line has been President George W Bush ' s publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months ."""
tr	Ind	An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order .
tr	Ind	The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi ' ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ).
tr	Ind	Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi ' ite leadership in Iran that go back decades .
tr	Ind	In essence , Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government .
tr	Ind	In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .
tr	Ind	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
tr	Ind	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Ind	The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases , and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power .
tr	Ind	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Ind	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Ind	"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran "" has some 540 , 000 men under arms and over 350 , 000 reserves ."
tr	Ind	They include 120 , 000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Ind	"Iran ' s military also includes holdings of 1 , 613 main battle tanks , 21 , 600 other armored fighting vehicles , 3 , 200 artillery weapons , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopters , 3 submarines , 59 surface combatants , and 10 amphibious ships ."""
tr	Ind	""" Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability ,"" continued the CSIS report ."
tr	Ind	""" Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional threat of proliferation ."
tr	Ind	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Ind	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Ind	"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."
tr	Ind	The so called ' Tanker ' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region .
tr	Ind	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Ind	""" More concerning ,"" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy ."
tr	Ind	"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect , anti - shipping cruise missiles : ' Iran has obtained new anti - ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines .'"""
tr	Ind	It is Iran ' s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .
tr	Ind	Iran ' s coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters .
tr	Ind	The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .
tr	Ind	In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf .
tr	Ind	Of all the missiles in Iran ' s armament , the most dangerous is the Russian - made SS - N - 22 Sunburn .
tr	Ind	These missiles are , simply , the fastest anti - ship weapons on the planet .
tr	Ind	Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2 . 2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .
tr	Ind	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .
tr	Ind	The missile ' s manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer , and five missiles could sink a 20 , 000 ton ship .
tr	Ind	The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile .
tr	Ind	The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf , with some 7 , 000 souls aboard .
tr	Ind	Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force , which includes the USS Tarawa , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor .
tr	Ind	The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf .
tr	Ind	The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .
tr	Ind	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
tr	Ind	Currently , the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs .
tr	Ind	The vaunted American military has suffered 2 , 210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare .
tr	Ind	The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war , a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days .
tr	Ind	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23 , 000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
tr	Ind	"In February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" challenges and threats "" in the region ."
tr	Ind	This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America ' s condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus .
tr	Ind	Like Iran , Syria ' s military is nothing to scoff at .
tr	Ind	Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
tr	Ind	Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel ' s overwhelming capabilities .
tr	Ind	As of 2002 , Syria had some 215 , 000 soldiers under arms , 4 , 700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability .
tr	Ind	The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft .
tr	Ind	Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region , comprised primarily of SCUD - derived systems .
tr	Ind	Iran , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies .
tr	Ind	Compounding this is the well - based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf .
tr	Ind	While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .
tr	Ind	China ' s economy is exploding , hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry .
tr	Ind	In the last several months , China has inked deals with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas .
tr	Ind	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .
tr	Ind	This threat exists not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .
tr	Ind	More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .
tr	Ind	"Paul Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $ 1 trillion ."
tr	Ind	China ' s accumulation of dollars is approximately $ 600 billion .
tr	Ind	South Korea holds about $ 200 billion .
tr	Ind	These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States .
tr	Ind	Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - China holds the cards .
tr	Ind	China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .
tr	Ind	"They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose ."""
tr	Ind	""" The hardest blow on Americans ,"" concluded Roberts , "" will fall when China does revalue its currency ."
tr	Ind	When China ' s currency ceases to be undervalued , American shoppers in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think they are in Neiman Marcus .
tr	Ind	"If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market , American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression ."""
tr	Ind	In short , China has the American economy by the throat .
tr	Ind	China ' s strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States .
tr	Ind	American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .
tr	Ind	The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception .
tr	Ind	The last three years of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this confidence .
tr	Ind	Worse , the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military , justifying the decrease in confidence .
tr	Ind	Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , recruiting is at an all - time low .
tr	Ind	Soldiers with vital training and know - how are refusing to re - enlist .
tr	Ind	Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point .
tr	Ind	Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .
tr	Ind	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .
tr	Ind	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .
tr	Ind	Conclusion : Is Any of This Possible ?
tr	Ind	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Ind	Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat .
tr	Ind	Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .
tr	Ind	Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe .
tr	Ind	"The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , all the dangers in the world are no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encased zealot .
tr	Ind	George W . Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front .
tr	Ind	"Karl Rove , Bush ' s most senior advisor , notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war ."""
tr	Ind	The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election .
tr	Ind	The answer lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
tr	Ind	The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP gains in Congress , and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away .
tr	Ind	Is any of this a probability ?
tr	Ind	Logic says no , but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics .
tr	Ind	All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .
tr	Ind	They did it once already in Iraq .

tr	Ind	I am sorry for him , he is a good dad
tr	Ind	Equine collages uk NEED HELP !!!?
tr	Ind	Can somebody give me the names some collages that do post 18 ( degrees or foundation degrees ) in either :
tr	Ind	No one employs people from Hartpury because of what they received on work experience .
tr	Ind	Merrist Wood ( I ' m there on a NVQ equine course ) do HND in equine management .
tr	Ind	Your best bet is to look on UCAS and do a course search .
tr	Ind	Hartpury College ( I think that is the name , but if you type it in it should come up with an alternative suggestion ), in Gloucestershire .
tr	Ind	They ' ll give you a comprehensive list of all the universities that do the courses you want , plus all the information you need to apply .
tr	Ind	Besides from Pacquiao , what else is The Philipines famous for ?
tr	Ind	You shouldn ' t ask this question it ' s intimidating , if i tell you what people knows about Philippines you will blush , thank god many thinks i ' m japanese just because of the way i keep myself , the way i talk and treat people , and the way i dress , so if you don ' t want nasty , insulting answers especially from those undesirable migrants like puttagenius , caloy , gro science , and irene .
tr	Ind	In fact Philippines is famous to accept people like these people i mentioned whose not filipinos but helping the Philippines to plunge in the pit as they are the rot of the country .
tr	Ind	They need to be expulse from the country and if they are not there they should be banned entering the country to plant their eggs , as they are considered as the rotten left overs of dinasaurs
tr	Ind	I ' ve been given the opportunity to live in Limerick , Ireland , next year as part of my course .. if you know about Limerick , what are the pros and cons ?
tr	Ind	The L . I . T is so close to Moyross , yet again the ppl who talk sh * t about Moyross still go there .
tr	Ind	Limerick ' s a great student city , there ' s loads on , you ' ll be spoilt for choice .
tr	Ind	Orla got it in one .
tr	Ind	Although there is ' bad press ' directing at AREA ' S of limerick , but nowhere near the university .
tr	Ind	Limerick is such a full city , shopping , night life , career choices , social choices , I came here about 12 years ago for college ..... and Orla got it spot on , I haven ' t left , nor would I .
tr	Ind	Its now my home .
tr	Ind	My myTouch 4G crashes with most custom ROMs I install .
tr	Ind	I really like the MIUI , but a process crashes repeatedly about every 3 seconds .
tr	Ind	not by the company ... as you voided your warrenty by installing custom roms
tr	Ind	you are best to either recover to the standard ROM , or find one that doesn ' t crash .
tr	Ind	Have you tried using clockwork recovery ?
tr	Ind	Those roms focus on speed and stability .
tr	Ind	They are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit .
tr	Ind	As a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom .
tr	Ind	Hope you read through this .
tr	Ind	are the moors and penines in Yorkshire a lonely eerie place ?
tr	Ind	and how big are they ?
tr	Ind	im 33 .
tr	Ind	ive never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all ... i can see the penines in the far distance from my bedroom window .
tr	Ind	when i watched werewolf in london ( great film ) that was the only time i saw the yorkshire moors .
tr	Ind	They can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands , then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
tr	Ind	The people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland .
tr	Ind	They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out , and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers .
tr	Ind	I have a western pleasure appy thats really heavy on her left lead at the lope ?
tr	Ind	My appy is very heavy on her left lead at the lope .
tr	Ind	She seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat ...
tr	Ind	If you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant .
tr	Ind	hi everyone .... just hav my hands on my new OLYMPUS X940 digital camera .. wel , i always wanted 2 hav one by sony .. but anyways , ended up having olympus X940 from my dad ....... does any1 already has it ?
tr	Ind	how has ur experience with it ?
tr	Ind	is it a gud option for casual / formal functions photography ?????
tr	Ind	is it comparable to sony products or not ??
tr	Ind	it has 14 mega pixel camera ... n 4xwide optical zoom ...
tr	Ind	Olympus X - 940 14 Megapixel Digital Camera has filters and can do all sorts of special effects .
tr	Ind	It is def worth more than the price .
tr	Ind	I am VERY satisfied .
tr	Ind	My answer is that we don ' t to text speak here ... we type in English .
tr	Ind	just want to ask .. i have an nikon dslr .. im wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200 - 300percent .. i can see some dead pixel ... is there something wrong with my camera body ?
tr	Ind	or it is normal ?
tr	Ind	Are you sure it isn ' t dirt on the sensor ?
tr	Ind	You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
tr	Ind	Cure is to get the sensor cleaned
tr	Ind	There should be a Pixel Mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them , most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels , some only show up on long exposures .
tr	Ind	If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can ' t find something in your own field .
tr	Ind	I have posted this question on the NZ visa site and can ' t get any info , does anyone know .???
tr	Ind	That would be preferable but it doesn ' t matter , could be something similar
tr	Ind	It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Ind	Your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector .
tr	Ind	If your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in New Zealand then you can work in any sector .
tr	Ind	It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Ind	In Chicago , what is the best restaurant to dine at on a budget ?
tr	Ind	Not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go .
tr	Ind	You can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner .
tr	Ind	But the best way is to use coupons .
tr	Ind	Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area .
tr	Ind	Is there any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Ind	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Ind	I know that the mouse will probably die , but I was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Ind	I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
tr	Ind	A common one is arsenic and there really isn ' t a way to cure that .
tr	Ind	Or , you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals .
tr	Ind	So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend .
tr	Ind	She loves giraffes and homemade things !
tr	Ind	I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture .
tr	Ind	I don ' t have much money so I bought Crayola Air - Dry Clay .
tr	Ind	I have sculpted the giraffe laying down .
tr	Ind	The key is ... I have a few problems :
tr	Ind	1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
tr	Ind	And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile !
tr	Ind	Is there any way to strengthen it ?
tr	Ind	2 . What kind of paint do I use to paint the giraffe ?
tr	Ind	3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?
tr	Ind	air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent , so you can leave the wire armature inside , paint with acrylic paint
tr	Ind	i have a 3 - 4 month old kitten and i live in forida .
tr	Ind	i am going to my grandmas in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia .
tr	Ind	My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside .
tr	Ind	she is also good in a carrier .
tr	Ind	We took our cat Mitten camping .
tr	Ind	He loved it .
tr	Ind	But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ).
tr	Ind	He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
tr	Ind	If your cat is not trained to use the litter pan , you may have a problem taking her .
tr	Ind	If not , what is ?
tr	Ind	Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don ' t require cleaner .
tr	Ind	If you must use a cleaner , pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated .
tr	Ind	I have had parakeets for a VERY long time , and I use pledge .
tr	Ind	I agree w the answer from Nothing .
tr	Ind	Even a cotton cloth ( I like diapers ) that is barely damp w water will work fine .
tr	Ind	Swiffer or any type of micro - fiber cloth is excellent .
tr	Ind	"I use Miracle Cloth , they ' re fantastic , just don ' t use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them , it ruins their "" grabbing "" ability ."

tr	Ind	i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
tr	Ind	Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
tr	Ind	And every computer manufactured in both Ireland & the UK are Region 2 aka PAL .
tr	Ind	There won ' t be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital .
tr	Ind	I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here
tr	Ind	If in dongle you mean USB stick then yes USB sticks are the same any were you go :) hope that answered your question .
tr	Ind	How do I take care of my newborn baby fish ?
tr	Ind	I am nervous that my other fish will eat them , and I don ' t know what to feed them !
tr	Ind	I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
tr	Ind	Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded .
tr	Ind	what kind of newborn fish you have ?
tr	Ind	some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes
tr	Ind	I have a question about McDonald ' s Monopoly !
tr	Ind	Ok , I know that Mcdonald ' s has Monopoly going on right now .
tr	Ind	& I wanna know what food has the game pieces .

tr	Ind	So can somebody please list ALL of the food that includes the game pieces , and the number of game pieces you get with THAT FOOD !
tr	Ind	The person who best explains this , and helps me out the best with my question will be REWARDED WITH TEN POINTS !!!!!!!
tr	Ind	THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!! : D
tr	Ind	bit of a stupid question but do the spikes / spines ( whatever you call them ) on their side and face area ever go hard .
tr	Ind	or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them
tr	Ind	becca is right .
tr	Ind	iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time .. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft .
tr	Ind	they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i wouldnt .
tr	Ind	they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :)
tr	Ind	Theyre not really hard .
tr	Ind	Beardies are actually quite delicate .
tr	Ind	I ' m assuming it ' s to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies .
tr	Ind	they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them .
tr	Ind	They just are there as an adaptation .
tr	Ind	what is a kimberwick bit used for ?
tr	Ind	Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking , hunting and doing cross country .
tr	Ind	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Ind	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Ind	Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently .
tr	Ind	For horses that are strong pullers .
tr	Ind	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Ind	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Ind	I know that ' s vague , but it depends on the horse .
tr	Ind	The rider needs to have independent hands as well , because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)
tr	Ind	I want to save up for a canon t3i , around 750 - 800 + :(
tr	Ind	I ' m currently 12 and I get about 20 dollars a week for lunch , sometimes a bit more , I plan to save 10 dollars every week :)
tr	Ind	My birthday is in november and I get about .... 150 or more since i hate my dads family .. haha
tr	Ind	There ' s a Canon EOS T2i , with the exact same sensor , just no articulating screen .
tr	Ind	It ' s around $ 100 less , which means you get the same camera but quicker !

tr	Ind	hey kido u made me smile
tr	Ind	does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air ?
tr	Ind	its for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
tr	Ind	"took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ("" the way you would icing "") to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "" mud """
tr	Ind	Plaster of Paris does two things
tr	Ind	- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
tr	Ind	- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
tr	Ind	For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm # LGGOBPROJ
tr	Ind	I ' m getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it ?
tr	Ind	I ' m quite sure , you don ' t even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it ' s edges , the part that is making the noise .
tr	Ind	works well lasts long .
tr	Ind	I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn ' t use it -
tr	Ind	he makes so much MORE noise , as he plays and digs and jumps ( seriously )
tr	Ind	wheels are relatively noiseless -
tr	Ind	a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet !
tr	Ind	How can I change my boarding station against the ticket I booked a month back from counter ?
tr	Ind	My origin Station is Howrah , but I want to board at Asansol ..
tr	Ind	Does your train pass Asansol when starting from Howrah ?
tr	Ind	If yes , you don ' t need to change it because you board later .
tr	Ind	In Calcutta there is a Foreigner ' s reservation office where they speak English very well .
tr	Ind	I don ' t remember near which station it is though .
tr	Ind	They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones ?
tr	Ind	Even if you don ' t find the foreigner ' s office you ' ll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station .
tr	Ind	This is where you can get AND change express train tickets .
tr	Ind	well if your desired boarding station comes after more than 2 or 3 halts of the actual boarding point , then the TC will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to others .
tr	Ind	my name is Josalyn Leainne Creek and i ' m 19 years old and i graduated from high in May adn of this year and i love animals and i ' m great at working and i had drama in my last job which was mcallister ' s deli and i ', a mormon and i hvae changed to be a better person that pwople are wanting to hirier and i ' m willing to work whenever you need me but i go to church on every sunday and i have a doctor ' s appointment this thursday at 2 ; 30 and i hope you h = guys hirier me because i work very hard and i dont care about how much you guys pay and i ' ve been looking for a job ever since i have graduated and i hate drama
tr	Ind	It makes a huge difference .
tr	Ind	No one ' s going to hire you if you can ' t even spell , especially if you ' re a high school graduate .
tr	Ind	Cover letters and resumes need to be perfect .
tr	Ind	No one ' s going to take you seriously if they ' re full of typos and whatnot .
tr	Ind	I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada , I received one that is valid until October of 2015 .
tr	Ind	Problem is , for some reason , the visa process took longer than it should , thus I missed school this semester ( visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn ' t attend ), now I no longer want to go into that school ( because they only would accept me again on September of 2012 ), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012 , can I use the same visa that was issued to me ?
tr	Ind	or do I need to reapply ?
tr	Ind	( in the visa itself , it does not mention anything about which school I m suppose to attend , and problem is , the embassy here in DC are not too nice and would never answer ANY questions ....) any advice please ?
tr	Ind	Visas and Study Permits are administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada , and any questions regarding applications should be directed to them .
tr	Ind	"So best advice is to go to the C & IC website and click "" contact us "" - http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / index . asp"
tr	Ind	How Do you Prevent A Dwarf Hamster Escaping From The Cage ?
tr	Ind	Im getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT !!!
tr	Ind	I ' ve never had a dwarf hamster but I ' ve had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it can ' t out .
tr	Ind	Yes I ' ve had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good
tr	Ind	This is the cage I have whhich is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to escape from :
tr	Ind	I love this cage , it ' s easy to clean , very spacious and fun for the hamster
tr	Ind	Aquiriums are good also , but provide a mesh top for an easy airway .
tr	Ind	Wire cages are NOT acceptable for dwarfs really , unless the bars have less than half a cm between them .
tr	Ind	I am 17 years old .
tr	Ind	I do not get along with my family .
tr	Ind	I dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment .
tr	Ind	I am very unhappy here .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know the best way of doing it .
tr	Ind	I live in London .
tr	Ind	I want to go travelling .
tr	Ind	My parents do not like me , They constantly reassure me that they will throw me out of home when I turn 18 .
tr	Ind	I don ' t particularly want to stay with them atm either .
tr	Ind	But right now its the most convenient thing to do .
tr	Ind	What is the best way of doing it ?
tr	Ind	anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience .
tr	Ind	I want to go all over :) I don ' t have a set route yet .
tr	Ind	Wool is best .
tr	Ind	You can always beg for spare change when you get hungry .
tr	Ind	I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
tr	Ind	The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
tr	Ind	And her last name , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?
tr	Ind	Certainly , Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam , only in Vietnam .
tr	Ind	Mayko is relating to the Japanese .
tr	Ind	"In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named "" first name "" according to that of their fathers ."
tr	Ind	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Ind	"Full name of the father is : "" Nguyen Thanh Luan "" ===> Full name of the son / daughter certainly is "" Nguyen .........."", for instance , "" Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan ""."
tr	Ind	"But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain "" First name "" in order to recall about their origination ."
tr	Ind	I ' m pretty sure that Mayko is Japanese .
tr	Ind	She is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure where her first name is from ...
tr	Ind	I have a splitter / filter between my ADSL and ph line ?
tr	Ind	I have 2 phones running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter , I ' m still getting a buzzing noise even when I have disconnected the other phone without one .
tr	Ind	Why is it stil doing this even though I don ' t have the other phone connected ?
tr	Ind	Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well ?
tr	Ind	You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks , except the one which the DSL modem connects .
tr	Ind	I ' ve modified my Holga 120 to take 35mm film and I know that you can ' t wind the film back , you have to open the back of the camera ( in a darkroom ) to rewind the film .
tr	Ind	What do other Holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling ?
tr	Ind	Do you just take a changing bag with you ?
tr	Ind	Whats the easiest thing ?
tr	Ind	It ' s light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera .
tr	Ind	You can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc .
tr	Ind	It ' s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you ' re outside .
tr	Ind	A changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag .
tr	Ind	A film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field .
tr	Ind	Many online stores carry them , like Adorama :
tr	Ind	I have a few how to videos for DIY 35mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel :
tr	Ind	I ' ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David .
tr	Ind	My argument is it ' s art and therefore should not be censored he ' s making us censor it who ' s right
tr	Ind	no , it ' s only a body of a young man
tr	Ind	the city of florence did at one time in the past put clothes on the statue
tr	Ind	"An art teacher in the mid - cities area of Dallas / Ft . Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw "" nudes "" in the museum ."
tr	Ind	You don ' t think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
tr	Ind	No , it was guys .
tr	Ind	Your teacher knows what goes on in your community and wants to keep her job .
tr	Ind	I am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak .
tr	Ind	We are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so I wanted something close .
tr	Ind	I have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu ...
tr	Ind	I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments .
tr	Ind	I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome .
tr	Ind	It ' s narrowed down to Butcher and Singer , Davio ' s , and Del Friscos .
tr	Ind	Sidenote ... I am familiar with the Capital Grille , Barclay Prime , The Palm , The Prime Rib , Mortons , Ruth Chris ', etc .
tr	Ind	I have weighed those options and found the three that I have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste .
tr	Ind	Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier .
tr	Ind	I am only familiar with Morton ' s and Ruth Chris .
tr	Ind	I have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do I know of anyone who has .
tr	Ind	I hope you get your answer .
tr	Ind	If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
tr	Ind	There are some things to consider though ...
tr	Ind	Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .
tr	Ind	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Ind	You also don ' t want it getting too warm for him too often .
tr	Ind	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
tr	Ind	It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
tr	Ind	What is the most interesting place to see in South Korea ?
tr	Ind	I ' m planning my trip to Asia and S . Korea is one of the destinations .
tr	Ind	It ' s so much fun over there , and I ' m positive that you ' ll love it ! :)
tr	Ind	If you ' re going to Seoul , then you should also visit a specific place called , ' The Namsan Tower '!
tr	Ind	It ' s a really huge place over there , and so many visitors / foreigners went to put chains and locks over there !
tr	Ind	It ' s so much fun !
tr	Ind	Everyone loves it ! ^ _ ^
tr	Ind	( It ' s indoors and outdoors !)
tr	Ind	( it ' s all outdoors and the pictures are only a fourth of the real Everland !)
tr	Ind	Hoped I helped ! ^ _ ^
tr	Ind	its really amazing there , itll blow your mind
tr	Ind	it ' s almost like paradise there
tr	Ind	I found an injured pure white bird ( dove I guess ?)
tr	Ind	what do I feed it ?
tr	Ind	I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood , its wing is injured , so I ' m currently taking care of it .
tr	Ind	It ' s pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I don ' t know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
tr	Ind	Is normal bird food fine ?
tr	Ind	( Because apparently my mom is very picky , she says the bird might get sick if it doesn ' t eat the right food ) IS there any specific food I might find at any pet shop ?
tr	Ind	Doves are a species of pigeon , they are Seed eaters , they do not eat bread , or worms .
tr	Ind	there ' s these little like bait worms at jacks . petshoppe .
tr	Ind	its jacks aquarium and pets I believe . ?
tr	Ind	anyways I feed them to my road sometimes .
tr	Ind	how do i get to paris cdg airport to paris montparnasse ?
tr	Ind	i have two options
tr	Ind	can anybody tell me if the metro runs directly from CDG to montparnasse ?
tr	Ind	As I recall , this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris .
tr	Ind	What are good B & W software ' s Photography ?
tr	Ind	What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing ?
tr	Ind	I use GIMP and Its not cutting it , looks terrible .
tr	Ind	Here ' s one of my shots in B & W
tr	Ind	It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
tr	Ind	Hope this helps .
tr	Ind	Picasa is free and pretty good .
tr	Ind	But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if your on a macbook theres aperture :)
tr	Ind	"depends what you want from "" B & W ""... many programs will use a generic B & W ..."
tr	Ind	I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body .
tr	Ind	Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for . .
tr	Ind	Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor .
tr	Ind	I know I wouldn ' t .
tr	Ind	You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
tr	Ind	"Sometimes the "" cheap "" comes expensive !"
tr	Ind	When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections , accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too !
tr	Ind	If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now !
tr	Ind	Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time .
tr	Ind	Maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced !
tr	Ind	The cheapest * high quality * plastic surgeons are at Yanhee Hospitals .
tr	Ind	They do outstanding work .
tr	Ind	When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
tr	Ind	"If you knew what kind of "" meat "" they put in canned cat food you ' d understand this ."
tr	Ind	I ' ve had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food .
tr	Ind	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food .
tr	Ind	They have done very well and like the dry food better .
tr	Ind	It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive .
tr	Ind	Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you ' re paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
tr	Ind	There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods .
tr	Ind	If he always does this , welcome to the club .
tr	Ind	My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver ( cooked ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest .
tr	Ind	Even if you mash it with a spoon he can ' t do that ,
tr	Ind	Whats your favorite part about trail riding ?
tr	Ind	My favorite part is going up hill and cantering :)
tr	Ind	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Ind	If you took some Olympic - level horses on a trail ride , they just couldn ' t do it .
tr	Ind	It doesn ' t matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
tr	Ind	What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
tr	Ind	That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
tr	Ind	Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good .
tr	Ind	YOU have to spend the time training .
tr	Ind	And I have not met one stuck - up trail rider !
tr	Ind	Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
tr	Ind	Same , when I ' m galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything .
tr	Ind	Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
tr	Ind	I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer .
tr	Ind	Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched .
tr	Ind	I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand .
tr	Ind	I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size .
tr	Ind	I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1 . 024 .
tr	Ind	I have a 10 gallon filter on it .
tr	Ind	I also have a powerhead , getting another soon .
tr	Ind	I have a few questions , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
tr	Ind	Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?
tr	Ind	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Ind	On the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank .
tr	Ind	If you ' re going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank , getting a protein skimmer wouldn ' t be a bad idea .
tr	Ind	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Ind	From what I understand they ' re pretty much the same thing .
tr	Ind	Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
tr	Ind	Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t want an iPad or Kindle .
tr	Ind	I just want an e - reader that does a little bit more than just read .
tr	Ind	Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that ' s not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
tr	Ind	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Ind	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Ind	When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
tr	Ind	So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
tr	Ind	I ' m pretty sure it ' ll be worth it .
tr	Ind	Judging by Nook Tablet ' s processor it ' s supposed to be quite faster !
tr	Ind	Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
tr	Ind	Hey there , I ' m trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday .
tr	Ind	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Ind	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Ind	I ' m looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to ' s .
tr	Ind	We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I ' m not an expert on the area .
tr	Ind	A little help is always great . =)
tr	Ind	Thank you or your feed back .
tr	Ind	Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
tr	Ind	It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
tr	Ind	It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
tr	Ind	Oh my gosh , they are great !
tr	Ind	I ' m getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
tr	Ind	I ' m still a beginner .
tr	Ind	Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help .
tr	Ind	You add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
tr	Ind	If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home .
tr	Ind	Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
tr	Ind	Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang ?
tr	Ind	I see youre still recovering from the accident .
tr	Ind	You appear to be feeling better though .
tr	Ind	That ' s good . :)
tr	Ind	Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang .
tr	Ind	While they are extremely accurate , laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target .
tr	Ind	Laser grips are the most common for wangs .
tr	Ind	The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on .
tr	Ind	You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions .
tr	Ind	Newer semi - automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft .
tr	Ind	This rail is used for multi purposes , such as laser devices or flashlight devices .
tr	Ind	You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang .
tr	Ind	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Ind	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Ind	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Ind	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Ind	She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
tr	Ind	What is the problem ?
tr	Ind	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Ind	I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he / she sleeps .
tr	Ind	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Ind	When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can ' t produce milk .
tr	Ind	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Ind	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Ind	Ok maybe that isn ' t the right question , but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada , can you send texts to another united states number ?
tr	Ind	And do you get charged for it ?
tr	Ind	Im sorry if I couldn ' t say the question right .
tr	Ind	I hope somebody understands what I mean
tr	Ind	If your ( US ) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company , you texts and calls will go through .
tr	Ind	The only way to know for sure is to call 611 , or your cell phone help line , and ask .
tr	Ind	The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it wouldn ' t work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
tr	Ind	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Ind	It varie $ company to company .
tr	Ind	Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text .
tr	Ind	Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection .
tr	Ind	$ ometime $ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $ involved what $ ome of your money .
tr	Ind	"Hope you unde $ tood the me $$ age I do have an "" S "" key on my computer ."
tr	Ind	I need HELP with my Syrian Hamster !!!?
tr	Ind	Hi , i bought my Syrian Hamster ( Fernando ) just yesterday and as i was told to leave
tr	Ind	As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now .
tr	Ind	So now i wanted to bouild up relationship with him so i got a piece of carrot and i put it on my hand , i moved very slowly and he suddenly run away to his tube .
tr	Ind	Why , how can i build up realtion ship with him he is also not useing the thing that he runs on and he wakes up walks around and goes to sleep again ???
tr	Ind	Firstly , your hammie was not stressed out , he wanted attention .
tr	Ind	Secondly , that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night .
tr	Ind	Hope I helped !
tr	Ind	You only got him yesterday .
tr	Ind	He ' s probably still scared and unsure .
tr	Ind	Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
tr	Ind	Once he is more comfy with his surroundings , then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more .
tr	Ind	Is Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
tr	Ind	My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years .
tr	Ind	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Ind	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Ind	I ' d be happy if someone helps , especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)
tr	Ind	I LIVE THERE !
tr	Ind	... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
tr	Ind	I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
tr	Ind	Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains !
tr	Ind	... Fishing , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things you can do for fun .
tr	Ind	And now they are finishing a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only !
tr	Ind	So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but its quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
tr	Ind	Visited Fujairah when in Dubai .
tr	Ind	Don ' t know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn ' t want to end up like them !
tr	Ind	Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
tr	Ind	Are there any new Gaming console ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t know should i buy PS3 or X - BOX Kinect .
tr	Ind	I ' m a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
tr	Ind	Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year .
tr	Ind	Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works .
tr	Ind	No matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
tr	Ind	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Ind	XBOX Joys are soo comfyy .....
tr	Ind	Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don ' t see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
tr	Ind	Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don ' t plan on making another one for a while .
tr	Ind	I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don ' t know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
tr	Ind	What is the typical lifespan of a cat ?
tr	Ind	My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill .
tr	Ind	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Ind	I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
tr	Ind	My cat is 18 years old .
tr	Ind	In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live ?
tr	Ind	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Ind	At 18 years , your cat has had a long life .
tr	Ind	Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11 - 15 years .
tr	Ind	Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues , so your cat has done very well .
tr	Ind	Male cats very seldom live past 14 - 15 years .
tr	Ind	Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare .
tr	Ind	Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I ' ve ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional .
tr	Ind	By comparison , outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment .
tr	Ind	According to a couple sources , the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon , England who reportedly live to the age of 36 .
tr	Ind	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Ind	Anything after 12 is a bonus .
tr	Ind	I thought that I had gained my cockatiel ' s trust , but now he ' s not coming to me when I open his cage .
tr	Ind	What do I do ?
tr	Ind	Did anything happen before losing his trust ?
tr	Ind	Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it ' s lost so easily !
tr	Ind	"Eating by his cage and keeping a "" sleep cage "" in your room is a good idea ."
tr	Ind	Birds eat and sleep with their flock , not predators .
tr	Ind	Patience is the key . =)
tr	Ind	dat bird is smart .
tr	Ind	like my dogs , they really like me and trust me , but when I open the door to get them outside , they run from me , they know I ' m going to take them outside and they don ' t like it .
tr	Ind	the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage , and birds don ' t usually like cages .
tr	Ind	so , I don ' t think the bird don ' t trust you , but still don ' t like the cage .
tr	Ind	Hi im a big fan of breyer horses !
tr	Ind	My breyers need stables or barns though ..... and I need directions and materials on how to make them .
tr	Ind	I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit .
tr	Ind	And I need to know where to buy the materials .
tr	Ind	NOTE : If i see a answer that i love i will make my best right there and then
tr	Ind	there are many small details , that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof ,
tr	Ind	How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
tr	Ind	I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today .
tr	Ind	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Ind	And when I move it I guess he figures I ' m playing . x . x
tr	Ind	I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
tr	Ind	That seems cruel to me though .
tr	Ind	Do you think he ' s teething ?
tr	Ind	It ' s getting out of hand .
tr	Ind	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Ind	No worries , i didn ' t try .
tr	Ind	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Ind	When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
tr	Ind	he may be teething but i dont think it can be stopped .
tr	Ind	lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , hes also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
tr	Ind	Which rat cage is better ?
tr	Ind	Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
tr	Ind	( Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover ) Which of these two cages is better :
tr	Ind	This one is better for rats .
tr	Ind	You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
tr	Ind	They LOVE to climb .
tr	Ind	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
tr	Ind	Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
tr	Ind	If you use this cage it ' s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
tr	Ind	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Ind	Here are some better options IMO :
tr	Ind	These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
tr	Ind	The First One Is much Better !
tr	Ind	I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
tr	Ind	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Ind	is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
tr	Ind	i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
tr	Ind	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Ind	from my understanding , if its heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
tr	Ind	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Ind	what are your suggestions and opinons ?
tr	Ind	i use UTH ' s on all of my burrowing snakes .
tr	Ind	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Ind	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
tr	Ind	i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
tr	Ind	on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
tr	Ind	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
tr	Ind	What are good places to eat brunch at ? ?
tr	Ind	My bday is Saturday :) and I wanna have breakfast / lunch with my fam .
tr	Ind	I was gonna have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having Having her bridal shower so brunch is it but the only places I know are denny ' s and ihop .
tr	Ind	Oh and btw I live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^ _ ^
tr	Ind	Don ' t be in a hurry though .
tr	Ind	They have fabulous French toast too .
tr	Ind	The Breakfast Club & Grill is conveniently located just two blocks off the Kennedy Expressway .
tr	Ind	There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot .
tr	Ind	We ' re at the corner of Hubbard and Noble .
tr	Ind	Unless you plan on being late for the bridal shower you might want to post this again in the L . A . section .
tr	Ind	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Ind	If yes , was Canada involved in this act / law ?
tr	Ind	Sorry , I ' m just very nervous after watching the movie .
tr	Ind	SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ), which is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
tr	Ind	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Ind	If you ever go on a cruise ship , you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill ( lifeboat drill ) within 24 hours of sailing .
tr	Ind	Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock .
tr	Ind	SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on .
tr	Ind	We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .
tr	Ind	Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
tr	Ind	This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
tr	Ind	I don ' t think so
tr	Ind	When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
tr	Ind	What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
tr	Ind	I ' ll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
tr	Ind	I ' m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
tr	Ind	Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
tr	Ind	How is the night life in Naha ?
tr	Ind	Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
tr	Ind	It doesn ' t have to be underground it could be any type of music .
tr	Ind	The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
tr	Ind	Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
tr	Ind	The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
tr	Ind	There ' s the market in Naha , which is great .
tr	Ind	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Ind	I ' m not sure that there ' s much nightlife in Naha .
tr	Ind	It ' s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
tr	Ind	Naha ' s not a very big city .
tr	Ind	I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model , and in the game it ' s 3 - shot burst .
tr	Ind	My brother said they only had full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
tr	Ind	My questions are ..
tr	Ind	1 ) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16 ?
tr	Ind	2 ) did Vietnam m16 ' s have a 3 - shot burst function ?
tr	Ind	To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
tr	Ind	He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
tr	Ind	Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it wasn ' t .
tr	Ind	As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming .
tr	Ind	Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
tr	Ind	The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
tr	Ind	Today ' s weapons do not have that kind of problem , and are much more reliable .
tr	Ind	1 ) modern m16 is alright .
tr	Ind	Vietnam m16 used to clog up and never work .
tr	Ind	2 ) All M16 ' s are either automatic or semi automatic .
tr	Ind	No one uses 3 burst .
tr	Ind	you play too much cod ; P
tr	Ind	modern m16 is best
tr	Ind	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Ind	Are the hotels back up and running ?
tr	Ind	Are there still aftershocks ?
tr	Ind	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Ind	Rotorua is fine .
tr	Ind	I ' m assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , don ' t worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
tr	Ind	As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the don ' t do any damage .
tr	Ind	Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
tr	Ind	However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and hasn ' t been cleared away yet .
tr	Ind	I ' m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
tr	Ind	Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
tr	Ind	( ps . I ' m assuming you ' ll stop off in Wellington , and since its summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
tr	Ind	Just recently discovered them last time I was down there , they ' re very nice ) www . kaffeeeis . co . nz
tr	Ind	Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you ' ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
tr	Ind	Yes it ' s ok .
tr	Ind	What size horse do i need ?
tr	Ind	Im around 5 ' 2 - 5 ' 4 , 11 years old and im wondering what size horse i ' ll need that i wont grow out of quickly ?
tr	Ind	I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
tr	Ind	"It ' s "" tall "" being it ' s bigger than a pony , but it ' s on the small end for a horse ."
tr	Ind	"I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5 ' 11 "" but my horse is about 16 . 2 or 16 . 3hh , TB ."
tr	Ind	A taller horse doesn ' t always mean a horse you can ' t handle .
tr	Ind	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Ind	"i ' m5 ' 3 - 4 "" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14 . 2hh and she ' s perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i can ' t bareback , not yet"
tr	Ind	Hope I helped :)
tr	Ind	Where in the world is Iguazu ?
tr	Ind	Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area .
tr	Ind	The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘ Garganta Del Diablo ’ ( The Devil ’ s Throat ), where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air .
tr	Ind	With the sun shinning down on the spray , creating a rainbow in the foreground , this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
tr	Ind	The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
tr	Ind	The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil , which is equally close .
tr	Ind	Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
tr	Ind	The bus is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours , although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats .
tr	Ind	The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
tr	Ind	Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .
tr	Ind	For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls .
tr	Ind	I am going to try and study aboard but idk where I can go I cannot decide where do you think would be the best place to go ?
tr	Ind	I have never been anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help !!!!
tr	Ind	you speak the language and will have more fun .
tr	Ind	The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
tr	Ind	London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
tr	Ind	As you ' re from the States you ' ll have much more fun in London .
tr	Ind	Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners .
tr	Ind	"I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal ( apparently this is "" washing down "" your food "") and not ordering wine ."
tr	Ind	However , outside Paris everybody is wonderful .
tr	Ind	Nobody likes the Parisians , even then Parisians don ' t like Parisians .
tr	Ind	South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
tr	Ind	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Ind	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Ind	Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
tr	Ind	I lived there for 8 months .
tr	Ind	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
tr	Ind	does the bta have to be paid first to come to canada ?
tr	Ind	There is NO such thing as a BTA .
tr	Ind	That is a term invented by online romance scammers
tr	Ind	""" Second only to flight money , the Basic Travel Allowance ( BTA ) is the scammers highest paying income ."
tr	Ind	Also known as the Personal Travel Allowance , Travellers Allowance Fee , Travellers Assistance Fund , Travellers Assurance Fund and numerous other forms of “ I have to have wodges of your cash or they won ’ t let me fly ”.
tr	Ind	"THERE IS NO SUCH THING any more , anywhere , it ’ s an online dating scam ."""
tr	Ind	""" THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BASIC TRAVEL ALLOWANCE !!"
tr	Ind	There is NO such requirement , in any country of the world .
tr	Ind	"This is an invention of the scammers . """
tr	Ind	A single call to CIC will confirm there is NO such thing as a BTA to Canada and anyone asking for this is a scammer http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / contacts / index . asp
tr	Ind	This person is not coming to visit you - the whole point of this scam is to gain your trust enough to steal your money and identity
tr	Ind	BTA only exists in the mind of SCAMMERS .
tr	Ind	"There is no such thing as a BTA or "" Basic Travel Allowance ""- this is 100 % a scam - as the first poster said , cut off any and all contact with this person - they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be ."
tr	Ind	The below site from the US government verifies this - it ' s the same for Canada , too .....
tr	Ind	i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
tr	Ind	"He ' s the issue , you are trying to "" Make "" them mate ."
tr	Ind	This is like trying to Make 2 people get married .
tr	Ind	It doesn ' t work .
tr	Ind	First you need a compatible pair .
tr	Ind	Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other , so there is hope there .
tr	Ind	Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
tr	Ind	The difference is what they need to live , VS what ' s ideal for them .
tr	Ind	Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed .
tr	Ind	Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other .
tr	Ind	Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Ind	They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
tr	Ind	When the males aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
tr	Ind	The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them .
tr	Ind	I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
tr	Ind	When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
tr	Ind	Recently she has been peeing A LOT .
tr	Ind	I ' m talking soaking all the litter box and then some .
tr	Ind	She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath .
tr	Ind	I don ' t have the money to take her to a vet right now but it ' s getting to be an issue .
tr	Ind	I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
tr	Ind	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Ind	First of all , I am very sorry to hear you ' re having this issue with your cat . :(
tr	Ind	Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
tr	Ind	Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones , but these usually are frequent visits , with small amounts of urine being passed .
tr	Ind	If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
tr	Ind	But your cat is passing a LOT of urine , and this is bad .
tr	Ind	Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
tr	Ind	Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream .
tr	Ind	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Ind	I want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program .
tr	Ind	I got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement .?
tr	Ind	"According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / immigrate / skilled / assess / index . asp , it states "" Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing ."""
tr	Ind	"HOWEVER ... that same web page also states that "" The current pass mark is 67 ."
tr	Ind	The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency .
tr	Ind	And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , both minimums were above my score .
tr	Ind	But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident .
tr	Ind	GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http :// www . canadavisa . com / canadian - immigration - faq - skilled - workers . html .
tr	Ind	Here is what they posted there
tr	Ind	""" 4 . May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points ?"""
tr	Ind	""" If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada , the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion ( referred to as substituted evaluation ) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points ."""
tr	Ind	The points system acts as a guide to sort out the best candidates .
tr	Ind	"Your application is still evaluated on a number of criteria , not all of them as "" cast in steel "" as the points ."
tr	Ind	"67 is the minimum score , anything below that is filed in the "" circular file basket ""."
tr	Ind	"Why have a "" minimum "" if it is going to be ignored ?"
tr	Ind	I ' m mad and don ' t know what to do !
tr	Ind	Alright , so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it .
tr	Ind	( I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again ) so I fineally checked it , and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida !!!
tr	Ind	I got so excited !!!!
tr	Ind	It said it was in January but still !!!!
tr	Ind	So I kept reading and then I saw the dates , it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday . :(
tr	Ind	then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates .
tr	Ind	( we live in Pennsylvania btw ) I ' m mad and upset now !
tr	Ind	We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days .
tr	Ind	**** sigh **** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really !
tr	Ind	A least your going .!
tr	Ind	Well , I mean , you don ' t have to be mad about it .
tr	Ind	At least you get to go to Florida in JANUARY .
tr	Ind	And , having only two days makes you realize what you have with your family .
tr	Ind	If they don ' t like it , it ' ll only be two days , remember ?
tr	Ind	Hope you have a crapload of fun !
tr	Ind	What is Italian High Renaissance ?
tr	Ind	1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .
tr	Ind	The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .
tr	Ind	Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
tr	Ind	The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ rebirth ”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .
tr	Ind	These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages .
tr	Ind	2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .
tr	Ind	The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardos fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de ' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .
tr	Ind	"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann ."
tr	Ind	[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over - simplifying artistic developments , ignoring historical context , and focusing only on a few iconic works .
tr	Ind	Hope it helps !
tr	Ind	I ' m American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
tr	Ind	I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
tr	Ind	do you get your visitors visa immediately at the airport ?
tr	Ind	I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitors visa .
tr	Ind	do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
tr	Ind	or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
tr	Ind	i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country .
tr	Ind	I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really don ' t have the money for .
tr	Ind	I ' m really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
tr	Ind	An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
tr	Ind	There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that .
tr	Ind	You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
tr	Ind	Above is the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , including passport information .
tr	Ind	It is free .
tr	Ind	I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U . K .
tr	Ind	You should be fine with just a passport , unless you ' re staying longer than six months .
tr	Ind	You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
tr	Ind	I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
tr	Ind	I visited London , Edinburgh , and St . Andrews so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
tr	Ind	That tactic never failed me .
tr	Ind	What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
tr	Ind	i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
tr	Ind	if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks ?
tr	Ind	There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
tr	Ind	You don ' t say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can ' t say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
tr	Ind	Silkies have hookless feathers .
tr	Ind	Sussexs have soft feathers .
tr	Ind	All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
tr	Ind	Skin Color : Silkies have black skin color , which is dominate .
tr	Ind	Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate .
tr	Ind	Either way rec . and dom . white genes dilute the black gene .
tr	Ind	Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
tr	Ind	Feathered Feet / Shanks - Chicks could have feathered feet / shanks as this is also incomplete dominate .
tr	Ind	Comb Type : Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) single is also there , but is recessive .
tr	Ind	Five Toes : Silkies have five toes .
tr	Ind	Sussex have four toes .
tr	Ind	Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
tr	Ind	Silkie crosses are great birds , and very neat looking .
tr	Ind	Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
tr	Ind	I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 .
tr	Ind	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Ind	http :// i . imgur . com / S2MD2 . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / T2zff . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / Xytex . jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 ( see links above ).
tr	Ind	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Ind	The lighting was not the best , but the pics turned out ok in my opinion .
tr	Ind	deleting a question where you dont like the answer won ' t get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
tr	Ind	you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
tr	Ind	[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
tr	Ind	lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
tr	Ind	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Ind	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
tr	Ind	There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
tr	Ind	In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a corner of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord .
tr	Ind	In the shot from the back , the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
tr	Ind	Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I dont think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
tr	Ind	I do like the shadow , though .
tr	Ind	My suggestion is to pay close attention to what ' s going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
tr	Ind	Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I didn ' t notice at first .
tr	Ind	what are some unique customs in ireland ?
tr	Ind	As far ask I ’ m aware our most unique custom would be the “ Country Wake ”.
tr	Ind	In all my travels I ’ ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
tr	Ind	After a person dies , their remains are “ waked ” in their home for roughly 2 - 3days .
tr	Ind	In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
tr	Ind	The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .
tr	Ind	Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
tr	Ind	The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
tr	Ind	Another unique custom ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
tr	Ind	The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
tr	Ind	Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
tr	Ind	I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
tr	Ind	The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one .
tr	Ind	The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
tr	Ind	the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
tr	Ind	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Ind	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Ind	I ' m unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn ' t react to seeing another cat on TV .
tr	Ind	I heard that a company ( here is a link : http :// news . yahoo . com / nestl - purina - releases - commercial - aimed - dogs - 183443091 . html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans can ' t hear .
tr	Ind	As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
tr	Ind	If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
tr	Ind	I wouldn ' t know -- I don ' t particularly like scary movies , and I haven ' t tried this with my pet .
tr	Ind	Although , I don ' t think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they ' ll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
tr	Ind	Do dogs enjoy watching T . V .?
tr	Ind	Well , T . V . is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture .
tr	Ind	The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
tr	Ind	To a dog , watching T . V . is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80Hz .
tr	Ind	So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
tr	Ind	So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T . V ., it ’ s probably because of the sounds .
tr	Ind	Hearing is a dog ’ s secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
tr	Ind	Yes they do .
tr	Ind	im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
tr	Ind	I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
tr	Ind	The place where I ' m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
tr	Ind	So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
tr	Ind	If they ask how much I ' m willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
tr	Ind	I saw a site that charges $ 0 . 70 per mile .
tr	Ind	Is that reasonable ?
tr	Ind	Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver ' s time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
tr	Ind	Three hours isn ' t far , but you are doing multiple shows .
tr	Ind	Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
tr	Ind	I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
tr	Ind	He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
tr	Ind	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Ind	All horses I ' ve had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive .
tr	Ind	Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
tr	Ind	Do they have this anywhere ?
tr	Ind	I want to take a cruise around the world .
tr	Ind	I mean literally around the world if possible .
tr	Ind	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Ind	Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to ?
tr	Ind	1 . Here ' s a site that lists world cruises including prices .
tr	Ind	"Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high "" single supplement "" costs in addition ."
tr	Ind	( Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone .
tr	Ind	You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ).
tr	Ind	2 . Short of chartering your own ship and crew , I don ' t see any way you could customize your own itinerary .
tr	Ind	Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
tr	Ind	Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i . e Transatlantic to London ( England ), England to Barcelona ( Spain ), Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ), Egypt to India via Suez canal etc .
tr	Ind	yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
tr	Ind	HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
tr	Ind	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Ind	Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
tr	Ind	There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China , there were lots of Japanese who ' d been displaced during WWII .
tr	Ind	The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
tr	Ind	The Mission was basically latin - american .
tr	Ind	As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
tr	Ind	So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that ' s because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that ' s who the photographers took pictures of .
tr	Ind	The other ethicities weren ' t well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70 ' s due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
tr	Ind	Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
tr	Ind	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Ind	You never saw black MUNI drivers , Asian police , Latino politicians until then .
tr	Ind	It was an evolution .
tr	Ind	Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid - 80s .
tr	Ind	We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
tr	Ind	We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then .
tr	Ind	We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
tr	Ind	Only Caucasians had any political power , corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods .
tr	Ind	San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers .
tr	Ind	There has always been a Mexican - American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico .
tr	Ind	We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
tr	Ind	San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically .
tr	Ind	The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
tr	Ind	EDIT : My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time .
tr	Ind	I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
tr	Ind	We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
tr	Ind	There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
tr	Ind	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Ind	So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
tr	Ind	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Ind	My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
tr	Ind	I just wanna make sure :) Thank !
tr	Ind	From my experience Hens ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc .
tr	Ind	You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , don ' t put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
tr	Ind	yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
tr	Ind	Rabbits do burrow also so don ' t be surprised if chicken are falling into holes .
tr	Ind	rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that .
tr	Ind	melting brass did not work ?
tr	Ind	my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures .
tr	Ind	we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
tr	Ind	what am I doing wrong
tr	Ind	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Ind	Molten brass is damn hot and usually it ' s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
tr	Ind	Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
tr	Ind	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Ind	Just the zinc fumes will get you , if you don ' t take precautions .
tr	Ind	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Ind	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Ind	Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Ind	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e . g . for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ).
tr	Ind	I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Ind	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ).
tr	Ind	I melt brass and cast it http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm
tr	Ind	Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
tr	Ind	I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http :// www . mikegigi . com / meltmetl . htm and http :// www . mikegigi . com / firehole . htm
tr	Ind	Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
tr	Ind	They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
tr	Ind	Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
tr	Ind	Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
tr	Ind	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Ind	Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions .
tr	Ind	We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
tr	Ind	Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch .
tr	Ind	Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
tr	Ind	I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
tr	Ind	When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
tr	Ind	I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which weren ' t a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
tr	Ind	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Ind	Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
tr	Ind	To prevent animal cruelty , many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat .
tr	Ind	Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
tr	Ind	We can ' t dictate what business wants to open where .
tr	Ind	If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
tr	Ind	They don ' t know ANYTHING about Ball pythons .
tr	Ind	When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
tr	Ind	She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
tr	Ind	I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I ' m 14 by the way
tr	Ind	Maybe if they see how much time and effort you ' ve devoted to researching the animal they ' ll reconsider .
tr	Ind	Once you ' ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
tr	Ind	My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .
tr	Ind	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Ind	My Snake ' s meal is TOO big , what can I do ?
tr	Ind	Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ).
tr	Ind	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Ind	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Ind	I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
tr	Ind	So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
tr	Ind	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Ind	I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
tr	Ind	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Ind	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Ind	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Ind	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Ind	I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
tr	Ind	Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine .
tr	Ind	"It is full of gay friendly "" everything ""."
tr	Ind	But , you could live where ever you fancy takes you .
tr	Ind	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Ind	Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
tr	Ind	( Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn ' t count for at least two years .)
tr	Ind	"A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
tr	Ind	"Just ' wanting to come to Canada "" is NOT enough ."
tr	Ind	YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history , combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record , and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration .
tr	Ind	It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
tr	Ind	IF you have NOT begun the Application process ' s NOW < you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada .
tr	Ind	"Being an American and from the "" south "" you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud ."
tr	Ind	I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
tr	Ind	Recently I ' m having trouble training him .
tr	Ind	He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
tr	Ind	And he is not following me when I was walking .
tr	Ind	I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it didn ' t help .
tr	Ind	Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
tr	Ind	And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , doesn ' t listen to me .
tr	Ind	He is really excited about anybody he see .
tr	Ind	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Ind	thank you very much .
tr	Ind	Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
tr	Ind	You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
tr	Ind	This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
tr	Ind	Patience is the key here .
tr	Ind	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Ind	You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
tr	Ind	why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
tr	Ind	or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
tr	Ind	I ' m looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
tr	Ind	This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
tr	Ind	Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
tr	Ind	Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice .
tr	Ind	Rooms start from 500 per double .
tr	Ind	Those ones are quite small .
tr	Ind	Must say , in Delhi it ' s hard to get good price / quality rating .
tr	Ind	I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
tr	Ind	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Ind	But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
tr	Ind	In Varanasi I don ' t know .
tr	Ind	I ' ve stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
tr	Ind	In Agra I ' ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
tr	Ind	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Ind	It was quite easy to find something .
tr	Ind	One night is enough !)
tr	Ind	There were many hotels there .
tr	Ind	Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
tr	Ind	You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
tr	Ind	To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn is best to stay in delhi .
tr	Ind	it is in karol bagh .
tr	Ind	some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it .
tr	Ind	TO Stay in Agra - Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you .
tr	Ind	it is centrally situated .
tr	Ind	To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel is you choice ...
tr	Ind	which one out of these makes the best pet ?
tr	Ind	and why is the one a better pet ?
tr	Ind	I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
tr	Ind	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
tr	Ind	So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
tr	Ind	So my opinion is Guinea pigs .
tr	Ind	( plus they dont stink that bad )
tr	Ind	Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
tr	Ind	Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had experience with all of those pets except Degus .
tr	Ind	They ' re incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
tr	Ind	"Mine learned to "" go to the bathroom "" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch ."
tr	Ind	The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
tr	Ind	That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
tr	Ind	My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine wasn ' t ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
tr	Ind	They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
tr	Ind	I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
tr	Ind	I ' ve never met a hamster that didn ' t bite me .
tr	Ind	Never had / handled a Degu .
tr	Ind	We have two .
tr	Ind	They are social and like to be handled .
tr	Ind	You have to have two because they don ' t do well alone .
tr	Ind	Two males can fight and you definitely don ' t want babies !!
tr	Ind	Guinea pigs ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
tr	Ind	They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
tr	Ind	They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots .
tr	Ind	Also they can ' t eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
tr	Ind	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Ind	Need Advice !?
tr	Ind	I wanted to volunteer and help animals , and decided to try fostering kittens .
tr	Ind	This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wits end .
tr	Ind	I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
tr	Ind	They track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed ....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything , including my bare legs !
tr	Ind	My legs and hands are just full of scratches .
tr	Ind	I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
tr	Ind	My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
tr	Ind	That ' s kind of the way it goes .. lol .
tr	Ind	For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
tr	Ind	They are testing out their claws and teeth .
tr	Ind	But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ' ll be interacting with the kittens .
tr	Ind	I find the adults are much easier .
tr	Ind	Generally they ' re not clawing and biting , they don ' t make nearly as much mess , they don ' t need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
tr	Ind	what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Ind	what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Ind	It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
tr	Ind	Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child ' s birth at the town hall / registrar ' s office .
tr	Ind	My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities .
tr	Ind	The birth registration was done right in hospital .
tr	Ind	My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ....
tr	Ind	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Ind	Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
tr	Ind	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Ind	If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , its simple to do it over the computer .
tr	Ind	This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
tr	Ind	You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
tr	Ind	If you were born elsewhere , start here .
tr	Ind	My parents didn ' t send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment .
tr	Ind	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Ind	I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
tr	Ind	When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital .
tr	Ind	As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
tr	Ind	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Ind	ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD * BOTH * !!
tr	Ind	i want to know which you liked better and WHY ?
tr	Ind	include which one had :
tr	Ind	- AND JUST MORE STUFF YOU LIKED OVERALL
tr	Ind	Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .
tr	Ind	Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
tr	Ind	Are there any major differences between them ?
tr	Ind	For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Ind	Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St . Thomas , the Bahamas and St . Martin / St . Maarten .
tr	Ind	The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
tr	Ind	The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ).
tr	Ind	We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don ' t believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
tr	Ind	Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .
tr	Ind	Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
tr	Ind	We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
tr	Ind	On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
tr	Ind	If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
tr	Ind	Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Ind	We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Ind	Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
tr	Ind	We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
tr	Ind	We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
tr	Ind	Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
tr	Ind	They both had pools for kids and adults .
tr	Ind	We liked the Liberty ' s pools better because one had a slide .
tr	Ind	If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
tr	Ind	Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
tr	Ind	We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Ind	Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas .
tr	Ind	Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
tr	Ind	What countries are the best to travel to ?
tr	Ind	I really want to travel when I leave school !
tr	Ind	Have you every traveled before ?
tr	Ind	( I Have 1 year before collage !)
tr	Ind	I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
tr	Ind	Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you ' ve never traveled before and you don ' t put where you would be traveling from .
tr	Ind	There are 50 of them , 48 located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between .
tr	Ind	There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
tr	Ind	What do you like to do ?
tr	Ind	Do you speak a foreign language ?
tr	Ind	I ' ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
tr	Ind	Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
tr	Ind	Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
tr	Ind	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Ind	Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ' ll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you ' re there .
tr	Ind	I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
tr	Ind	You can ' t beat the price for what you get .
tr	Ind	How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
tr	Ind	Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
tr	Ind	We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
tr	Ind	We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it .
tr	Ind	you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
tr	Ind	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Ind	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Ind	you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
tr	Ind	the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ), but others will work just as well .
tr	Ind	he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
tr	Ind	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Ind	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Ind	they just do it on their own .
tr	Ind	I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
tr	Ind	Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
tr	Ind	( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
tr	Ind	My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
tr	Ind	If I come towards him , he will run away .
tr	Ind	How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
tr	Ind	Its very frustrating .
tr	Ind	I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
tr	Ind	I trained her myself .
tr	Ind	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .
tr	Ind	I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog .
tr	Ind	She tosses me around like its nothing !
tr	Ind	... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
tr	Ind	Is there any tricks I could use ?
tr	Ind	You have to be in command at all times .
tr	Ind	There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
tr	Ind	If you push it , it will never work .
tr	Ind	will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
tr	Ind	I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
tr	Ind	or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
tr	Ind	If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
tr	Ind	Thank you !
tr	Ind	If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
tr	Ind	The are located right at 248 De Than St . in the heart of the back packer district .
tr	Ind	I have taken this tour and it was great .
tr	Ind	I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
tr	Ind	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Ind	Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
tr	Ind	And no , I do not work for them . :)
tr	Ind	I am just a satisfied customer .
tr	Ind	The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
tr	Ind	Oh , if you are confused .
tr	Ind	Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe .
tr	Ind	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Ind	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Ind	If you ' re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
tr	Ind	Most of the tourists that I ' ve come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
tr	Ind	You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
tr	Ind	The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
tr	Ind	It ' s called Kiwi Heaven and it ' s across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
tr	Ind	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Ind	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Ind	Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
tr	Ind	We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
tr	Ind	We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
tr	Ind	Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
tr	Ind	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Ind	I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
tr	Ind	But there are just so many poses and programs !
tr	Ind	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Ind	I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
tr	Ind	Because I don ' t feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
tr	Ind	I also have back problems that transfer into my legs .
tr	Ind	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Ind	Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
tr	Ind	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Ind	Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
tr	Ind	Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
tr	Ind	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Ind	If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
tr	Ind	BTW you dont want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
tr	Ind	When I first started doing it I ' d do it every day .
tr	Ind	Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
tr	Ind	Now not only is my leg better , but my back is relaxing .
tr	Ind	what are you having problems with ?
tr	Ind	maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i ' ve thought about getting one .
tr	Ind	You don ' t want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
tr	Ind	My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
tr	Ind	He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight .
tr	Ind	I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water .
tr	Ind	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Ind	The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
tr	Ind	So my question is ..
tr	Ind	Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
tr	Ind	I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it .. what should i do ?
tr	Ind	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Ind	thank you :)
tr	Ind	They didnt take x - rays they offered them but i just couldnt afford anymore treatment .
tr	Ind	I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
tr	Ind	I will give them and call and see what they say .
tr	Ind	Thank you for the help .
tr	Ind	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Ind	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Ind	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .
tr	Ind	1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
tr	Ind	However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
tr	Ind	Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays )?
tr	Ind	2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn ' t think it would be helpful .
tr	Ind	He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ).
tr	Ind	From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .
tr	Ind	And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just doesn ' t feel good .
tr	Ind	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
tr	Ind	You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about .
tr	Ind	They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
tr	Ind	You need to ask your vet these questions .
tr	Ind	My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
tr	Ind	Did they do any x - rays ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
tr	Ind	You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
tr	Ind	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
tr	Ind	I ' m in my 20 ' s and currently studying in France .
tr	Ind	Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc ..'
tr	Ind	However , I ' ve read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
tr	Ind	In addition , from my understanding one - on - one dates is something that comes much later and not ' straight - away ' like us anglo - saxons .
tr	Ind	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
tr	Ind	They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
tr	Ind	Is it true ?
tr	Ind	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Ind	She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
tr	Ind	She is also nicer when we are both alone .
tr	Ind	However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
tr	Ind	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
tr	Ind	My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along .
tr	Ind	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
tr	Ind	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
tr	Ind	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Ind	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Ind	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
tr	Ind	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
tr	Ind	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
tr	Ind	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
tr	Ind	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
tr	Ind	""" Non !"" means "" non "", not "" I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case ."""
tr	Ind	Christiane gave you a good answer .
tr	Ind	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
tr	Ind	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there ' s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
tr	Ind	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Ind	If she is nicer when you are alone I ' d say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
tr	Ind	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Ind	Unfair for the girl as boys don ' t have that kind of handicap , but that ' s the way our own rules work .
tr	Ind	Should have done research before you left .
tr	Ind	True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
tr	Ind	There are no jobs in this country .
tr	Ind	I ' m just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
tr	Ind	Is there a future for our nation ' s youth ?
tr	Ind	I ' m two years into an undergraduate degree .
tr	Ind	Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
tr	Ind	Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas , to Australia , etc .
tr	Ind	There ' s obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc .)
tr	Ind	Your answer doesn ' t do anything but remind me that I ' m going to be $ 25 , 000 in debt by the time I ' m 22 .
tr	Ind	I really like you ' re answer .
tr	Ind	it ' s very logical .
tr	Ind	I ' ve also considered becoming a teacher , but it ' s not a job I ' m cut out for .
tr	Ind	I also wish I ' d applied for a scholarship .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t think I ' d be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
tr	Ind	Obviously I ' m still completely stupid though .
tr	Ind	I mean , I wasn ' t smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
tr	Ind	And yes , I am being melodramatic .
tr	Ind	* gasps * So I wouldn ' t make a good prostitute ?
tr	Ind	Are you saying I ' m bad in bed ?
tr	Ind	Your answer is very sweet , but I ' m not compassionate towards teenage high school students .
tr	Ind	In my opinion , far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees .
tr	Ind	Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting , but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications ?
tr	Ind	I ' m studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I ' m done .
tr	Ind	I ' ve also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
tr	Ind	I also know that you don ' t get paid that much more in Australia than you do here .
tr	Ind	And it ' s not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
tr	Ind	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
tr	Ind	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Ind	At the moment there ' s no interest , but that ' ll probably change .
tr	Ind	And they ' ll probably add interest to what you ' ve already racked up .
tr	Ind	And they ' re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
tr	Ind	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they ' ll force you cough up .
tr	Ind	And all that time you ' re overseas you ' ll be racking up interest .
tr	Ind	I guess I ' m extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree .
tr	Ind	But I worked hard and I ' m still working hard .
tr	Ind	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
tr	Ind	I ' m doing fine .
tr	Ind	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it ' s not anything new .
tr	Ind	It depends on what you hunger for .
tr	Ind	700f jobs aren ' t advertised .
tr	Ind	That means making yourself known ; that means networking .
tr	Ind	why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
tr	Ind	i have a baby eastern king snake .
tr	Ind	i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
tr	Ind	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Ind	as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
tr	Ind	according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
tr	Ind	he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
tr	Ind	( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won ' t eat .)
tr	Ind	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Ind	i handle him every few days .
tr	Ind	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Ind	i just love him to death .
tr	Ind	i don ' t know why he won ' t eat though !
tr	Ind	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
tr	Ind	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
tr	Ind	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Ind	he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
tr	Ind	he doesn ' t seem to know that they are food .
tr	Ind	"i have tried "" braining "" both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he doesn ' t care ."
tr	Ind	i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
tr	Ind	i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake ' s face .
tr	Ind	i am very discouraged and sad and i don ' t know what to do .
tr	Ind	he hasn ' t eaten in an entire month .
tr	Ind	i ' ve only tried to feed him one at a time .
tr	Ind	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Ind	do babies this small hibernate ?
tr	Ind	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
tr	Ind	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
tr	Ind	If he doesn ' t seem interested in them at all I would say he ' s just not hungry .
tr	Ind	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Ind	They can smell it so i ' m sure he knows what it is and just don ' t want it .
tr	Ind	In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
tr	Ind	King snakes sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
tr	Ind	They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
tr	Ind	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Ind	Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
tr	Ind	Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding .
tr	Ind	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
tr	Ind	It ' s natural and so long as you don ' t see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
tr	Ind	You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
tr	Ind	They ' re fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
tr	Ind	hope this helped .
tr	Ind	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Ind	It ' s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
tr	Ind	are my two cats fighting or playing ?
tr	Ind	how rough is too rough ?
tr	Ind	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Ind	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Ind	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Ind	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
tr	Ind	were they roughhouse playing ?
tr	Ind	or were they actually fighting ?
tr	Ind	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Ind	any answers help !!!!!!
tr	Ind	you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
tr	Ind	you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
tr	Ind	right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
tr	Ind	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn ' t now .
tr	Ind	she knows she is invading someone else ' s territory , but can ' t help it , and has no where to go .
tr	Ind	as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
tr	Ind	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Ind	your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
tr	Ind	this is not good .
tr	Ind	you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
tr	Ind	when they play fight , they don ' t hiss .
tr	Ind	if they hiss , they are not playing .
tr	Ind	if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .
tr	Ind	hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .
tr	Ind	"A hiss is basically a "" get the f * ck away "" sound ."
tr	Ind	It means they ' ve gone too far .
tr	Ind	When they start bleeding that means they ' re really fighting .
tr	Ind	If they ' re going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as they can ), and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as they can with their paws ) then they ' re playing .
tr	Ind	I have two cats , and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
tr	Ind	The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
tr	Ind	That means they are fighting .
tr	Ind	When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing .
tr	Ind	I can see how you get confused though . :)
tr	Ind	What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?
tr	Ind	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
tr	Ind	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Ind	He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
tr	Ind	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Ind	Thing is , it worked .
tr	Ind	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ).
tr	Ind	When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia .
tr	Ind	All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated .
tr	Ind	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Ind	The Communists agreed .
tr	Ind	However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
tr	Ind	The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
tr	Ind	THAT WAS THE PLAN .
tr	Ind	What happened ?
tr	Ind	The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas .
tr	Ind	The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked .
tr	Ind	Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
tr	Ind	The government did NOT fall .
tr	Ind	When give the ultimate choice , they rallied …
tr	Ind	Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
tr	Ind	They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
tr	Ind	The people rejected their attempt to topple the government , and for all intents and purposes the US military ( and the ARVN ) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time - frame he ordered it .
tr	Ind	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Ind	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Ind	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Ind	They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it .
tr	Ind	The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ).
tr	Ind	In the end Nixon kept his promise for “… peace with honor ….”
tr	Ind	But that ’ s another question .
tr	Ind	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Ind	In that , they pretty much succeeded .
tr	Ind	Before Tet , the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA .
tr	Ind	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Ind	There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
tr	Ind	I just bought a baby one yesterday .
tr	Ind	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Ind	"My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the "" sun rays "" he needs ?"
tr	Ind	I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
tr	Ind	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Ind	He ' s getting used to his new home , but hasn ' t eatin yet .
tr	Ind	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
tr	Ind	Thank you for your time .
tr	Ind	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that ' s the easy one to provide for .
tr	Ind	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
tr	Ind	The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed ' s Repsitun model : http :// lllreptile . com / store / catalog / reptile - supplies / uvb - fluorescent - lights - mercury - vapor - bulbs /-/ zoo - med - 24 - repti - sun - 100 - fluorescent - bulb / Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .
tr	Ind	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Ind	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
tr	Ind	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Ind	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
tr	Ind	Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
tr	Ind	Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
tr	Ind	Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .
tr	Ind	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Ind	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Ind	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Ind	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Ind	That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
tr	Ind	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Ind	Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so its anyone ' s guess whether or not he ' ll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
tr	Ind	I tell all my customers they can try it , but don ' t count on it .
tr	Ind	Is a finch or a parakeet better ?
tr	Ind	I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
tr	Ind	Heres my reason .....
tr	Ind	I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
tr	Ind	I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
tr	Ind	At first it was all cool and all .
tr	Ind	They were chirping and doing their every day business .
tr	Ind	After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
tr	Ind	They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them .
tr	Ind	Ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed .
tr	Ind	They dont want to be held or touched .
tr	Ind	I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
tr	Ind	I still have them and they are doing well .
tr	Ind	A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
tr	Ind	They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
tr	Ind	I love them .
tr	Ind	First of all they are very tame .
tr	Ind	I tamed them in 4 days .
tr	Ind	They can do tricks and they arent messy .
tr	Ind	The whole family loves them .
tr	Ind	My parents even plays with them .
tr	Ind	They are a big part of our family .
tr	Ind	I hope this helps you with your decision .
tr	Ind	They are both about the same noise level .
tr	Ind	the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .
tr	Ind	If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
tr	Ind	The girl has either pink or brown .
tr	Ind	They sometimes dont get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
tr	Ind	I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
tr	Ind	They are the best !
tr	Ind	If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
tr	Ind	My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
tr	Ind	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Ind	These are the steps I used .
tr	Ind	Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets .
tr	Ind	I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
tr	Ind	Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
tr	Ind	( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
tr	Ind	This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them .
tr	Ind	( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
tr	Ind	( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food )....
tr	Ind	( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
tr	Ind	When they see that you arnt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .
tr	Ind	4 ) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying .
tr	Ind	You have patience .
tr	Ind	After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
tr	Ind	and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
tr	Ind	They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !
tr	Ind	They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Ind	And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
tr	Ind	a parakeet is friendlier
tr	Ind	They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
tr	Ind	They are also friendly .
tr	Ind	I have a parakeet named Cookie . : P
tr	Ind	When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
tr	Ind	I graduate in the spring , and so we ' d like to go between then and winter .
tr	Ind	We don ' t want too many tourists , and since we ' ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
tr	Ind	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Ind	We ' re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we ' re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
tr	Ind	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Ind	One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
tr	Ind	And then there ’ s the rain .
tr	Ind	Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
tr	Ind	County Kerry is the worst affected .
tr	Ind	The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
tr	Ind	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Ind	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Ind	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Ind	Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
tr	Ind	Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country ’ s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
tr	Ind	Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid - July – again , it ’ s all part of the uncertainty principle .
tr	Ind	Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ’ s Festival .
tr	Ind	Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular .
tr	Ind	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Ind	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
tr	Ind	Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
tr	Ind	"As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "" there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes """
tr	Ind	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Ind	If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
tr	Ind	The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ?).
tr	Ind	Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
tr	Ind	It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
tr	Ind	To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don ' t have a bus or train service .
tr	Ind	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
tr	Ind	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Ind	We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
tr	Ind	Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
tr	Ind	The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
tr	Ind	We had frosts in October so I wouldn ' t advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
tr	Ind	You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
tr	Ind	You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
tr	Ind	Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe .
tr	Ind	I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish .
tr	Ind	1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long .
tr	Ind	2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5cm long .
tr	Ind	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Ind	I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday .
tr	Ind	If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive !
tr	Ind	I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
tr	Ind	Worms ( and Daphnia ) are also rich in Lipids , substances important in forming eggs and growing young .
tr	Ind	I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males .
tr	Ind	If you have plants in your tank .
tr	Ind	your lineatus are already spawning .
tr	Ind	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Ind	( I ' ve even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer !
tr	Ind	I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .
tr	Ind	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
tr	Ind	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Ind	Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .
tr	Ind	Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .
tr	Ind	They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
tr	Ind	The water changes help with that too .
tr	Ind	The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
tr	Ind	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Ind	Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult ' s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
tr	Ind	If a pair isn ' t leaving eggs ... check the following :
tr	Ind	1 . Is a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the eggs ?
tr	Ind	2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes ?
tr	Ind	3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?
tr	Ind	Aplo . lineatus are wide - spread over southern India .
tr	Ind	That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .
tr	Ind	TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist ' s hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department ' s annual reports .
tr	Ind	They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ).
tr	Ind	A number of minerals are not of much consequence .
tr	Ind	However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo .)
tr	Ind	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Ind	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
tr	Ind	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Ind	Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .
tr	Ind	Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .
tr	Ind	If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
tr	Ind	Hope there is useful grist for the mill here .
tr	Ind	What is the best time of year ?
tr	Ind	It is vacation time .
tr	Ind	Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
tr	Ind	They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
tr	Ind	What is the best option ?
tr	Ind	Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids , which best suit you can select ?
tr	Ind	Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
tr	Ind	There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
tr	Ind	From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more .
tr	Ind	This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
tr	Ind	The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters .
tr	Ind	Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
tr	Ind	No , the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages .
tr	Ind	Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
tr	Ind	There are two ships , Disney magic and Disney wonder .
tr	Ind	Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers .
tr	Ind	Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
tr	Ind	It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
tr	Ind	These are decorated uniquely and marvelously .
tr	Ind	The ship offers variety of eatables , deliciously made .
tr	Ind	Sea fishes , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard .
tr	Ind	There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
tr	Ind	There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
tr	Ind	These theme parks have all types of facilities .
tr	Ind	It is really an entertainment for the kids .
tr	Ind	There are other amnesties also .
tr	Ind	These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
tr	Ind	To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option .
tr	Ind	There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
tr	Ind	Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
tr	Ind	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Ind	They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
tr	Ind	We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
tr	Ind	All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
tr	Ind	You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
tr	Ind	Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
tr	Ind	Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
tr	Ind	We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we ' had ' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
tr	Ind	My wife and I , in our 60 ' s at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
tr	Ind	We had a ball .
tr	Ind	We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
tr	Ind	There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
tr	Ind	There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
tr	Ind	You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
tr	Ind	If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
tr	Ind	The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
tr	Ind	Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife ' s taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
tr	Ind	Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
tr	Ind	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Ind	If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
tr	Ind	but food is always available and it is consistently good .
tr	Ind	I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
tr	Ind	This is about my farrier , girls .
tr	Ind	That ' s why I ' m posting here !
tr	Ind	I posted this in singles and dating too , so I ' ve just copied and pasted .
tr	Ind	I have known this guy for a long time , but we ' ve never been good friends or anything .
tr	Ind	He is my farrier ( shoes my horses feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
tr	Ind	Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty .
tr	Ind	He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
tr	Ind	We were also just talking about my horse ' s crappy feet and he mentioned .
tr	Ind	""" Well , if you ever just want to see me I ' ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after ."""
tr	Ind	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Ind	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Ind	He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
tr	Ind	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Ind	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
tr	Ind	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Ind	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Ind	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Ind	It ' s a father and son business .
tr	Ind	Thank you for reading if you did ! :)
tr	Ind	Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
tr	Ind	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Ind	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Ind	This is about the fourth time they ' ve done my horse ' s feet because I just switched back to them .
tr	Ind	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Ind	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Ind	Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
tr	Ind	So , obviously I switched back to these guys .
tr	Ind	I ' ve known the guy for about 10 years .
tr	Ind	I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
tr	Ind	He is a few years older than me .
tr	Ind	And yes , I do like him .
tr	Ind	To answer Barry White , yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he ' s waiting for .
tr	Ind	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Ind	And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
tr	Ind	I ' ve never done that before though either .
tr	Ind	"It ' s always just "" Okay , they ' re feet need to be done , better call the farrier ."""
tr	Ind	And they usually come out within a few days .
tr	Ind	He will call you back Im sure !
tr	Ind	Sounds like He really likes you ..
tr	Ind	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
tr	Ind	or is he Not your type ?
tr	Ind	Or are you undecided ?
tr	Ind	If i were you I would Go ...
tr	Ind	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
tr	Ind	Edit ... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing ..
tr	Ind	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
tr	Ind	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
tr	Ind	When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby ..( for those who don ' t Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
tr	Ind	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Ind	sorta wonder what it would have been like ?
tr	Ind	But That was Years ago .
tr	Ind	He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
tr	Ind	Well one day he said to me You know i don ' t wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
tr	Ind	Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn ' t see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
tr	Ind	Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
tr	Ind	I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
tr	Ind	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Ind	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Ind	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Ind	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Ind	From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he ' s doing a really shitty job .
tr	Ind	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Ind	This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
tr	Ind	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Ind	He ' s not lame , but he ' s been having issues .
tr	Ind	Here ' s what the owner has said :
tr	Ind	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Ind	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Ind	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
tr	Ind	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ).
tr	Ind	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
tr	Ind	Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .
tr	Ind	He can eat all his feed and doesn ' t drop any , but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
tr	Ind	He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .
tr	Ind	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Ind	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
tr	Ind	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
tr	Ind	NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .
tr	Ind	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
tr	Ind	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
tr	Ind	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
tr	Ind	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
tr	Ind	Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well .
tr	Ind	I ' ll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....
tr	Ind	Horse is out of state and not local .
tr	Ind	Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .
tr	Ind	Worse comes to worse , I ' m out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
tr	Ind	He ' s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
tr	Ind	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Ind	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
tr	Ind	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Ind	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Ind	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Ind	I am not going to go pick up a horse I can ' t afford .
tr	Ind	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
tr	Ind	The owner is the one who is unable .
tr	Ind	I will also be having my other vet up who ' s a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
tr	Ind	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Ind	He ' s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn ' t be related ).
tr	Ind	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Ind	He ' s not starving .
tr	Ind	He ' s dropping we
tr	Ind	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Ind	He ' s not starving .
tr	Ind	He ' s dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days .
tr	Ind	He ' s not putting it back on .
tr	Ind	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
tr	Ind	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
tr	Ind	I know this is going to be expensive .
tr	Ind	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Ind	Gallop , I ' ve already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .
tr	Ind	Looked at studies , treatment options and such .
tr	Ind	The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
tr	Ind	If that is the case then acupuncture isn ' t going to hurt him .
tr	Ind	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Ind	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Ind	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Ind	Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .
tr	Ind	Is that something you are up for ?
tr	Ind	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Ind	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
tr	Ind	As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we ' ve had to deal with it .
tr	Ind	Pretty much every large stable has here .
tr	Ind	Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
tr	Ind	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
tr	Ind	That horse returned to racing and we didn ' t notice much difference .
tr	Ind	We ' ve had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
tr	Ind	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Ind	I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .
tr	Ind	One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM .
tr	Ind	We ' ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .
tr	Ind	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
tr	Ind	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know .
tr	Ind	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Ind	I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM .
tr	Ind	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Ind	West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn ' t always include a fever .
tr	Ind	You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I don ' t think I could take in a horse right now these issues .
tr	Ind	Personally I think you should just keep on walking by .
tr	Ind	You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .
tr	Ind	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Ind	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
tr	Ind	A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .
tr	Ind	Was it always like this ?
tr	Ind	Or has it occurred since birth .
tr	Ind	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Ind	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
tr	Ind	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Ind	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .
tr	Ind	Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor .
tr	Ind	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Ind	My neck is fixed !.
tr	Ind	He knows what hes doing .
tr	Ind	We just had our wedding on 11 / 7 / 08 and was very impressed .

tr	Ind	They don ' t take coupons .
tr	Ind	They have a credit card minimum .
tr	Ind	This place is the opposite of QuikTrip : crappy in every way .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had 2 cuts now from Georgia and have paid more in other salons / barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut !
tr	Ind	I don ' t get it .
tr	Ind	This place is awesome , with a great ambiance and cool décor , and the food is scrumptious ( and especially their signature banana split ).

tr	Ind	I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carried out the electrical work ), they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor .
tr	Ind	They really go above and beyond !
tr	Ind	For example , I actually forgot to feed my cat , and they went out of their way to take care of him .
tr	Ind	Additionally , when there was confusion ( my fault ), they left me flowers along with a personalized gift .
tr	Ind	They have been 100 % reliable and professional .

tr	Ind	I sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon .
tr	Ind	I love the people , the product and the service !
tr	Ind	Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time . -
tr	Ind	The Brick , Ikea , and Leon ' s have their place .
tr	Ind	The internet here is terrible .
tr	Ind	Like the previous poster said , the com lines are split between the entire building .
tr	Ind	That ' s 3x worse than Qwest DSL ' s lowest speed offering !
tr	Ind	The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice , but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap .

tr	Ind	You can ' t go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
tr	Ind	Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu , although popcorn is a nice touch !
tr	Ind	Their food and sweets are awesome .
tr	Ind	But service is very poor .
tr	Ind	Never gives a receipt .
tr	Ind	Sometimes even gives wrong dish .
tr	Ind	Line up is so stupid .

tr	Ind	If you want great food then L ' espalier is the place to go .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
tr	Ind	Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free , even if you didn ' t buy your car there !
tr	Ind	Their selection is random , so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store .
tr	Ind	I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances .
tr	Ind	My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time .

tr	Ind	We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I ' m extremely happy with the whole thing .
tr	Ind	I have nothing bad to say .
tr	Ind	Very glad that we went with them .
tr	Ind	Employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other , while myself and other customers were completely ignored .
tr	Ind	Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales persons attention .
tr	Ind	It wasn ' t until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you .
tr	Ind	I got a coupon from Pennysaver for this station .
tr	Ind	Yes , they accepted it .
tr	Ind	However , during the test , they did whatever they can to get my test failed .
tr	Ind	Then , they sold me overpriced stuffs , such as oil tank cap , so that my car can pass it right away .
tr	Ind	I ended up paying much more .
tr	Ind	Are you kidding me ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t get it .
tr	Ind	You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt .
tr	Ind	The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude .
tr	Ind	If this is the best that Tucson has to offer , I am outta here ...

tr	Ind	There are plenty of good dentists in Fernandina .
tr	Ind	What you get is a $ 13 / day charge to access the internet through a slow 512 / 512kb / s that you can only use to check email etc ( Read : No downloading ).
tr	Ind	Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
tr	Ind	It ' s impossible to get an appointment .
tr	Ind	If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re - schedule ... for 6 weeks later .
tr	Ind	And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient .
tr	Ind	Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt , friendly and informative service .

tr	Ind	November 7 , 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience .
tr	Ind	From the delectable Antipasto Misto to the Spaghetti alla Barese and the Parmigiana and ending with gelato , all was mouth watering .
tr	Ind	Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake .
tr	Ind	Service was excellent !
tr	Ind	Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
tr	Ind	My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont !!!
tr	Ind	Course has come a long way !!
tr	Ind	HCC ' s new nine was a little shaky at first , but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course !!

tr	Ind	My husband and I happened in on a whim .
tr	Ind	We sat in the front dining area , it was very cozy and pleasant .
tr	Ind	Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic .

tr	Ind	This was a flavorful , enjoyable meal for both of us .
tr	Ind	went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake !
tr	Ind	she didnt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it !
tr	Ind	she needs to develop a personality !
tr	Ind	brought dog home and its all choppy now !
tr	Ind	It ' s helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting .
tr	Ind	If you watch a lot of fights ( youtube ) and research some of the history ( http :// en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bullfighting ) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more !
tr	Ind	Also after seeing a handful of bullfights , I can say that they ' re a lot more enjoyable if you ' re smashed ( BAC >= . 15 ).
tr	Ind	All I can say is that I am glad I went in !
tr	Ind	The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful .
tr	Ind	This place is about healing , not making a buck .
tr	Ind	The followup visit is FREE !!

tr	Ind	THANK YOU !!
tr	Ind	I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
tr	Ind	Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .
tr	Ind	It was a no brainer really .
tr	Ind	I choose Console Pros and I ' m happy I did .
tr	Ind	This place is bad .
tr	Ind	It ' s dark , dingy & dirty .
tr	Ind	The salads are limp and the rest of the food isn ' t any better ( ok , the nachos are not too bad !)

tr	Ind	This is the original Ham ' s restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80 ' s -- but this one is no more .
tr	Ind	Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management .
tr	Ind	According to news accounts , the company is struggling .
tr	Ind	I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
tr	Ind	We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
tr	Ind	Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them .
tr	Ind	We called few companies before we decide to hire them .
tr	Ind	They came on time and completed their work quickly .
tr	Ind	We were very happy how clean looked our windows .
tr	Ind	If you have some problems with your windows , you should call them .
tr	Ind	I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers !
tr	Ind	I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
tr	Ind	They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes .
tr	Ind	I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
tr	Ind	This is a perfect place to get your hair done .
tr	Ind	I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut .
tr	Ind	When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
tr	Ind	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Ind	Highly Recommend
tr	Ind	I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed .
tr	Ind	No matter what state I am in when I arrive , I always leave feeling better .
tr	Ind	She has not only helped me through some challenging computer - work and sports related injuries , she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend her .
tr	Ind	What a fantastic store , I love this place .
tr	Ind	Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
tr	Ind	Their items are very unique , great quality , great prices .
tr	Ind	They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
tr	Ind	Dr . Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
tr	Ind	Dr . Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .
tr	Ind	She is and excellent doctor to have on one ' s team .
tr	Ind	Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST !
tr	Ind	My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re - wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
tr	Ind	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
tr	Ind	He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers .
tr	Ind	I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
tr	Ind	Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish .
tr	Ind	They set out to exceed your expectations .
tr	Ind	Already I ' m considering future projects , and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing .
tr	Ind	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
tr	Ind	They have messed up my order and .... The food was just not good !
tr	Ind	I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
tr	Ind	I hope they get there act together ...
tr	Ind	I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see ??
tr	Ind	I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS .
tr	Ind	THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY .
tr	Ind	THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE , I GUARANTEE IT .
tr	Ind	You ' ve Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
tr	Ind	I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
tr	Ind	"Beats having one "" cleaning lady "" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "" maids "" did !"
tr	Ind	This place has the best baby and childrens clothes .
tr	Ind	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
tr	Ind	I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
tr	Ind	Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it .
tr	Ind	I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
tr	Ind	I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago .
tr	Ind	I wanted to try someplace new again .
tr	Ind	This place rocked .
tr	Ind	Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good ..
tr	Ind	We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
tr	Ind	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Ind	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
tr	Ind	I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
tr	Ind	I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
tr	Ind	I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like its getting infected .
tr	Ind	I ' m certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong .
tr	Ind	Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
tr	Ind	How do these places stay in business .
tr	Ind	This town needs some food soul and this is not it .
tr	Ind	My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
tr	Ind	Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection , and was presented perfectly .
tr	Ind	The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
tr	Ind	Then the desserts came , and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had .
tr	Ind	I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
tr	Ind	It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Ind	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Ind	The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
tr	Ind	Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
tr	Ind	Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
tr	Ind	Tiger Heating is awesome .
tr	Ind	I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
tr	Ind	These guys were absolutely professional .
tr	Ind	John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
tr	Ind	If you need someone to help you out with your heating problems , I DEFINITELY would call TIGER HEATING and AIR .
tr	Ind	My family and I thank you !!!!!!!!!!
tr	Ind	They Suck
tr	Ind	Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700 .
tr	Ind	After searching high and low for a salesman , I was treated like dirt , and we left .
tr	Ind	Parts department blows , Service department is even worse .
tr	Ind	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
tr	Ind	Nigel from Nidd Design has always provided a first class service , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications .
tr	Ind	His knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application , ensuring compliance with the building regulations .
tr	Ind	Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else .
tr	Ind	He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home !
tr	Ind	We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close .
tr	Ind	Got the crab rangoon which was great , tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good .
tr	Ind	Bea was really nice and asked how the food was .
tr	Ind	As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
tr	Ind	However , I still like this place a lot .
tr	Ind	Margaritas are alright .
tr	Ind	My only complaint is the QUESO .
tr	Ind	It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
tr	Ind	They fixed the queso !
tr	Ind	Thankyouthankyou
tr	Ind	There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston .... don ' t . waste your time here .
tr	Ind	I had the morelias enchiladas .
tr	Ind	The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good . at all .
tr	Ind	In fact my friend vomited after our meal .
tr	Ind	Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
tr	Ind	Service was okay not great , we came for a late lunch .
tr	Ind	I don ' t recommend this place .
tr	Ind	My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew .
tr	Ind	James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
tr	Ind	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
tr	Ind	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Ind	When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tr	Ind	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
tr	Ind	To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New movies not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people who spend $ 30 or more groceries ..
tr	Ind	That did it for me .. no more Raina ' s .
tr	Ind	Besides parking is a pain .. cramped and un - ruly with Kumon Parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees '
tr	Ind	Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
tr	Ind	I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I ' ve had with bigger offices and firms .
tr	Ind	While I hope I don ' t have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I ' ll definitely use this firm again .
tr	Ind	Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
tr	Ind	The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
tr	Ind	I LOVE MY GYM !
tr	Ind	FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily .
tr	Ind	If you are serious about working out in a non - commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be .
tr	Ind	This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body don ' t be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
tr	Ind	This restaurant is over - rated .
tr	Ind	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Ind	The service is poor ...
tr	Ind	I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
tr	Ind	Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel ' s chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
tr	Ind	The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
tr	Ind	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
tr	Ind	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
tr	Ind	I ' m very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .
tr	Ind	When i say jiu - jitsu or mma i mean it !
tr	Ind	Best jiu - jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up !
tr	Ind	When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday !
tr	Ind	If your coach has no fights and you never see him train and sweat something is wrong !
tr	Ind	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Ind	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Ind	Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
tr	Ind	They are very rude over the phone and in person .
tr	Ind	They talk down to you like they are supreme beings , if you hate your job so much then quit !!
tr	Ind	How these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing .
tr	Ind	Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city .
tr	Ind	this is a good place
tr	Ind	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
tr	Ind	They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty .
tr	Ind	I enjoy going there although i ' ve only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
tr	Ind	i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
tr	Ind	Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
tr	Ind	A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
tr	Ind	They don ' t seem to be interested in selling cars .
tr	Ind	Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
tr	Ind	The salesperson refused !
tr	Ind	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
tr	Ind	We were the only customers there !
tr	Ind	ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES .
tr	Ind	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
tr	Ind	SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
tr	Ind	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
tr	Ind	IF YOU WANT A STEAK , WELL , THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY .
tr	Ind	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
tr	Ind	The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
tr	Ind	Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food .
tr	Ind	But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
tr	Ind	If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
tr	Ind	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Ind	I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
tr	Ind	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I ' ma bit surprised by other comments .
tr	Ind	She ' s very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
tr	Ind	Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
tr	Ind	I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
tr	Ind	They have the best prices locally and good customer service .
tr	Ind	One guy is a little surley , but who gives a crap as long as your car ' s work is outstanding .
tr	Ind	AND they ' re usually able to help you as a walk - in , and they ' re fast .
tr	Ind	Another great business bites the dust !
tr	Ind	A bit pricey , so I didn ' t go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
tr	Ind	The prices were worth what I got .
tr	Ind	I ' m assuming they are completely out of business since I can ' t find any contact information .
tr	Ind	I ' m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
tr	Ind	What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you ' re in a small town rather than Baltimore .
tr	Ind	The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
tr	Ind	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
tr	Ind	The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
tr	Ind	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
tr	Ind	Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks .
tr	Ind	Service was excellent .
tr	Ind	Food was excellent .
tr	Ind	Wine was excellent .
tr	Ind	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I ' ll definitely order a steak .
tr	Ind	They interviewed me , gave me tests in the software I included on my resume , and placed me in a position that I kept for several years .
tr	Ind	Re - interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job .
tr	Ind	I ' m really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
tr	Ind	They are dependable , have great connections in the community , and are a great resource for finding a job .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend them to all of my friends !!!!!
tr	Ind	I adopted a 3 . 5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
tr	Ind	The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding .
tr	Ind	My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family !
tr	Ind	No silverware , asked for a spoon for my sons mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon .
tr	Ind	Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got it .
tr	Ind	Never checked back with us once we got our food .
tr	Ind	Had to go the the bus boys station ourselves to get napkins .
tr	Ind	Only one server , too buys talking with others I guess .
tr	Ind	Food was good , but service means a lot to me .
tr	Ind	Dr . Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had .
tr	Ind	You are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
tr	Ind	I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now , However I am glad you are my dentist now .
tr	Ind	Even though you are expensive .
tr	Ind	Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth .
tr	Ind	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
tr	Ind	I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
tr	Ind	I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car wouldn ' t pass unless I replaced a hose .
tr	Ind	Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
tr	Ind	If you ' re a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
tr	Ind	even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
tr	Ind	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
tr	Ind	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
tr	Ind	What kind of rude service is that ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t want to waste my time with them .
tr	Ind	So here we are in Manson .
tr	Ind	And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
tr	Ind	Boutique stores dealing in children ' s clothing / gifts are often outrageously priced ( who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie ?)
tr	Ind	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Ind	The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
tr	Ind	A lack of organisation , coupled with the distain for its customers , makes this the worst rental agency I have used .
tr	Ind	Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in ( many of them still unresolved as I left ) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds , after I left . . . . as soon as I could .
tr	Ind	Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
tr	Ind	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Ind	Anyway , once that is fixed , this place will be amazing .
tr	Ind	Drinks were awesome , prices reasonable , and staff friendly .
tr	Ind	This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs .
tr	Ind	Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
tr	Ind	But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
tr	Ind	And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
tr	Ind	I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser ' s .
tr	Ind	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Ind	The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend Fraiser ' s for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
tr	Ind	I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
tr	Ind	It ' s located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
tr	Ind	The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories .
tr	Ind	The friendly crew working was great & very helpful .
tr	Ind	This store is what Colorado is all about .
tr	Ind	Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
tr	Ind	It ' s durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
tr	Ind	I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
tr	Ind	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Ind	The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
tr	Ind	We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
tr	Ind	I recommend them highly !
tr	Ind	Their service sucks to start off with , people are cruel and ignorant .
tr	Ind	I ' m compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
tr	Ind	They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS , they will NOT take it back !
tr	Ind	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
tr	Ind	And they THRIVE to get a customer .
tr	Ind	I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
tr	Ind	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Ind	My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
tr	Ind	This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
tr	Ind	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
tr	Ind	This is a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
tr	Ind	I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already .
tr	Ind	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
tr	Ind	Disgusting french fries is very best menu .
tr	Ind	The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
tr	Ind	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
tr	Ind	Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
tr	Ind	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
tr	Ind	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Ind	The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal .
tr	Ind	Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
tr	Ind	We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it ' s worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
tr	Ind	This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
tr	Ind	The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
tr	Ind	It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
tr	Ind	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
tr	Ind	I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
tr	Ind	This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
tr	Ind	I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
tr	Ind	best quote ever My gate was stuck halfway open so I calledA CLASS Garage Doors Dr Services .
tr	Ind	They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
tr	Ind	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
tr	Ind	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
tr	Ind	I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired , I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
tr	Ind	Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula .
tr	Ind	The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
tr	Ind	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Ind	The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
tr	Ind	They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
tr	Ind	Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car !
tr	Ind	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
tr	Ind	I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
tr	Ind	Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first .
tr	Ind	This place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie .
tr	Ind	"I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ..."" the inspection guy isn ' t here today "".... for example ."
tr	Ind	Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection ... but I was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had time to read a chapter in my book .
tr	Ind	As first - time home buyers , my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .
tr	Ind	She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
tr	Ind	Stephanie ' s knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
tr	Ind	We appreciated her patience , knowledge and kindness !
tr	Ind	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Ind	I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
tr	Ind	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
tr	Ind	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you ' ll be good .
tr	Ind	"Got some nice "" freshly baked "" fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine ."
tr	Ind	Took a bite , it tasted odd .
tr	Ind	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
tr	Ind	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Ind	She also refused to get a manager .
tr	Ind	I left my number , or tried to anyway .
tr	Ind	Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
tr	Ind	For cheap Chinese food , this is the place to go .
tr	Ind	I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .
tr	Ind	Now , I won ' t eat fast food Chinese unless it ' s from this place .
tr	Ind	The best value I ' ve found from a Chinese restaurant .
tr	Ind	I don ' t live in Lake St . Louis anymore , but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous .
tr	Ind	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin ' : sadface :
tr	Ind	My experience was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa .
tr	Ind	Jana Kueck was nothing but professional .
tr	Ind	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
tr	Ind	Jana made me feel very comfortable .
tr	Ind	Provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing .
tr	Ind	Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
tr	Ind	Equipment is state of the art .
tr	Ind	I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
tr	Ind	Dave is a patient and methodical teacher , who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take .
tr	Ind	Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
tr	Ind	Dave has much to offer .
tr	Ind	In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I ' m already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
tr	Ind	We love our new roof !
tr	Ind	We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
tr	Ind	Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done .
tr	Ind	We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job everyday .
tr	Ind	And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
tr	Ind	We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
tr	Ind	I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
tr	Ind	ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
tr	Ind	I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already !
tr	Ind	My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
tr	Ind	Their customer service was perfect !
tr	Ind	Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted .
tr	Ind	Thank you Roll UP Crepes !
tr	Ind	This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
tr	Ind	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Ind	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
tr	Ind	The best person is the valet .
tr	Ind	I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
tr	Ind	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
tr	Ind	The fitness center was GREAT !
tr	Ind	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Ind	I absolutely LOVED living there .
tr	Ind	I have never had better service .
tr	Ind	My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia .
tr	Ind	They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .
tr	Ind	Everyone was pleasant and very helpful .
tr	Ind	The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
tr	Ind	The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
tr	Ind	I give this dealer an A +!
tr	Ind	THIS PLACE IS THE BEST .
tr	Ind	I HATED SUSHI BEFORE BUT NOW I CANT STOP EATTING IT !!!!!!!
tr	Ind	EVERYTHING IN HERE SEEMS TO AMAZE ME !!!
tr	Ind	THEIR GRILL DISHES ARE OUTTA THIS WORLD AND SUSHI IS JUST FABULOUS !!!!
tr	Ind	I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK .
tr	Ind	THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS .
tr	Ind	JUNO AND OPEN I LOVE YOU GUYS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Ind	The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .
tr	Ind	There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .
tr	Ind	The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
tr	Ind	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ), but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
tr	Ind	Love the soups .
tr	Ind	Do we need another one ?
tr	Ind	Only if it is of the quality of That ' s Amore .
tr	Ind	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Ind	The arancini di riso ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
tr	Ind	Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there ' s the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
tr	Ind	Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used .
tr	Ind	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
tr	Ind	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
tr	Ind	They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services .
tr	Ind	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
tr	Ind	As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
tr	Ind	They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
tr	Ind	Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
tr	Ind	Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was “ excellent ”.
tr	Ind	We love T ' s Cafe !
tr	Ind	T ' s has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
tr	Ind	Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
tr	Ind	If you ' ve been to North County , chances are it ' s in your favorites list already .
tr	Ind	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
tr	Ind	They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
tr	Ind	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Ind	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Ind	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
tr	Ind	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Ind	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
tr	Ind	Looks like there ' s a lot of talent in this place .
tr	Ind	I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
tr	Ind	I rated it 5 stars .
tr	Ind	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Ind	I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
tr	Ind	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Ind	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Ind	They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet .
tr	Ind	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
tr	Ind	I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
tr	Ind	I ' ve never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
tr	Ind	If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired !
tr	Ind	I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
tr	Ind	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
tr	Ind	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
tr	Ind	The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
tr	Ind	They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won ' t hurt my score .
tr	Ind	Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
tr	Ind	They have a huge inventory .
tr	Ind	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Ind	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Ind	Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
tr	Ind	As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
tr	Ind	As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
tr	Ind	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Ind	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
tr	Ind	Dr . Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
tr	Ind	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Ind	Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general , Dr . Taylor was the best !
tr	Ind	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Ind	This school is the worst one i ' ve ever been to .
tr	Ind	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Ind	There ' s holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
tr	Ind	The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they don ' t listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student ' s ).
tr	Ind	The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
tr	Ind	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
tr	Ind	That was 4 years ago .
tr	Ind	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Ind	( I ' ve been through at least 5 places already .)
tr	Ind	If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
tr	Ind	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
tr	Ind	The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
tr	Ind	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Ind	The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if your looking fot a good game and aren ' ta nerd , dont ask them .
tr	Ind	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
tr	Ind	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn ' ta fps .
tr	Ind	He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
tr	Ind	Overall they aren ' t very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
tr	Ind	My friend and I went there for lunch today .
tr	Ind	Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we ' d try it .
tr	Ind	BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
tr	Ind	We both kept trying to find something we liked .
tr	Ind	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Ind	Liquidweb . com Rocks !!!
tr	Ind	I am not a client of liquidweb . com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
tr	Ind	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Ind	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
tr	Ind	The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
tr	Ind	You have been awarded the converted Hino Dealer of the Year !
tr	Ind	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
tr	Ind	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you ' ll love Vetri .
tr	Ind	Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I ' ve ever eaten ( and I ' ve eaten a lot ).
tr	Ind	The antipasti were amazing , the wines were mind - blowing , the service couldn ' t have been better .
tr	Ind	I ' ve dined at lots of high - end restaurants and I ' ve never before felt my money was so well spent .
tr	Ind	I ' ve been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
tr	Ind	They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
tr	Ind	The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
tr	Ind	There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you ' d like .
tr	Ind	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Ind	David is amazing
tr	Ind	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
tr	Ind	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
tr	Ind	He was patient and adapted when everything didn ' t go according to schedule on my wedding day .
tr	Ind	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Ind	He got the pictures back to me quickly .
tr	Ind	He doesn ' t just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won ' t even notice that there ' s a camera there .
tr	Ind	My husband just got a bike there as a gift he ' s only had it a month .
tr	Ind	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Ind	But just this week a peddle broke .
tr	Ind	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
tr	Ind	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Ind	Which was very expensive .
tr	Ind	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Ind	Trek is not so great
tr	Ind	I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
tr	Ind	The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
tr	Ind	It ' s pretty ridiculous !
tr	Ind	They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
tr	Ind	They don ' t care one bit about you !!!!!
tr	Ind	Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
tr	Ind	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
tr	Ind	When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy didn ' t know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
tr	Ind	Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
tr	Ind	So what was the point of the appointment !?!
tr	Ind	Internet Department is rude and insulting
tr	Ind	"I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "" AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ."
tr	Ind	"I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS "" Wow , can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles ."
tr	Ind	As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
tr	Ind	This place is a Rip - Off
tr	Ind	"I brought a car in to have the "" check engine "" light diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
tr	Ind	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Ind	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Ind	Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ).
tr	Ind	I did the work myself for $ 50 .
tr	Ind	There ' s no excuse for that kind of estimate .
tr	Ind	My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn ' t want to wait in line at Outback .
tr	Ind	What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
tr	Ind	# 1 its immaculately clean .
tr	Ind	# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
tr	Ind	This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
tr	Ind	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
tr	Ind	Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
tr	Ind	I came in and saw Dr . Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
tr	Ind	I have to tell you that I haven ' t had one and don ' t want one .
tr	Ind	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
tr	Ind	I sent a customer of mine to you .
tr	Ind	Dr . Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
tr	Ind	I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before .
tr	Ind	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Ind	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates .
tr	Ind	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
tr	Ind	Hello my name is Vera and I ' m writing a review about my own counseling practice in Bellevue , WA . and in Renton WA .
tr	Ind	I am a licensed mental health counselor and I work with variety of mental health problems .
tr	Ind	I offer compassionate , approachable and personalized counseling services .
tr	Ind	My style is compassionate , nonjudgmental , and caring .
tr	Ind	I am a preferred provider with most insurance companies .
tr	Ind	I would appreciate reviews from anyone who has worked with me before in the mental health setting .
tr	Ind	If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you ' ll love this zoo .
tr	Ind	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Ind	They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
tr	Ind	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Ind	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
tr	Ind	Among the animals that were available to touch were pony ' s , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
tr	Ind	I can ' t say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
tr	Ind	Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me !!!!
tr	Ind	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
tr	Ind	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Ind	She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
tr	Ind	You should give her a try - it ' s worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
tr	Ind	Worst Service I ' ve Ever Experienced
tr	Ind	I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there isn ' t .
tr	Ind	1 ) Service and manners were nonexistent .
tr	Ind	2 ) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
tr	Ind	( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
tr	Ind	4 ) The business is very unorganized .
tr	Ind	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Ind	Exile is the best !!!
tr	Ind	Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
tr	Ind	I have been shopping there for over six years now .
tr	Ind	The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
tr	Ind	The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
tr	Ind	In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
tr	Ind	Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
tr	Ind	Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that doesn ' t impress me .
tr	Ind	The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
tr	Ind	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Ind	The angry lobster was completely over - priced !
tr	Ind	$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
tr	Ind	Alto delivers on all levels .
tr	Ind	From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
tr	Ind	The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
tr	Ind	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Ind	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Ind	The landlord is not nice nor helpful
tr	Ind	I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
tr	Ind	I love the location and the apartment !!
tr	Ind	I ' ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
tr	Ind	The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
tr	Ind	And the exterminator is very nice , also .
tr	Ind	Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that ' s going to be anywhere you go !
tr	Ind	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
tr	Ind	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Ind	I know that ' s ugly ... but she won ' t help you out for anything ... sad story .
tr	Ind	The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
tr	Ind	The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
tr	Ind	A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
tr	Ind	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
tr	Ind	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Ind	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Ind	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Ind	I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
tr	Ind	There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
tr	Ind	and most correctly , us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife .
tr	Ind	Kathy and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection .
tr	Ind	I hope to be back !
tr	Ind	really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I ' d stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
tr	Ind	"The neon lighting sign still said "" on "" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they ' d be open tomorrow ."
tr	Ind	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
tr	Ind	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
tr	Ind	While there wasn ' t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
tr	Ind	It ' s not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
tr	Ind	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Ind	Restored my faith in Mechaincs .
tr	Ind	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Ind	I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal .
tr	Ind	They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
tr	Ind	The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
tr	Ind	They have restored my faith in Mechanics .
tr	Ind	We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
tr	Ind	Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts .
tr	Ind	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Ind	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I ' m sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
tr	Ind	The waiters are like no other ...
tr	Ind	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Ind	The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
tr	Ind	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Ind	Holly is truely the best hairstylist !
tr	Ind	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
tr	Ind	I was very pleased with my experience here .
tr	Ind	All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
tr	Ind	I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
tr	Ind	She did a great job !
tr	Ind	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Ind	My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
tr	Ind	I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
tr	Ind	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Ind	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Ind	The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
tr	Ind	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don ' t let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
tr	Ind	I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
tr	Ind	So huge in fact , that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references , and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria .
tr	Ind	Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
tr	Ind	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Ind	The finest Christmas Trees i ' ve ever seen .
tr	Ind	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
tr	Ind	The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
tr	Ind	The owners were entertaining and gracious .
tr	Ind	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals .
tr	Ind	This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
tr	Ind	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
tr	Ind	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I ' ve always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
tr	Ind	all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
tr	Ind	The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
tr	Ind	the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
tr	Ind	hope this helps !!
tr	Ind	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Ind	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Ind	I normally don ' t write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one won ' t be getting my business , nor my family ' s , nor my co - workers .
tr	Ind	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Ind	I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
tr	Ind	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
tr	Ind	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Ind	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
tr	Ind	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Ind	I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
tr	Ind	That said , I hated this restaurant .
tr	Ind	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Ind	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
tr	Ind	Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
tr	Ind	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Ind	I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
tr	Ind	Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle .
tr	Ind	"He told me "" no problem , we will match the offer or do better ."""
tr	Ind	Mr . Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
tr	Ind	Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world .
tr	Ind	I urge all St . Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
tr	Ind	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
tr	Ind	The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
tr	Ind	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
tr	Ind	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
tr	Ind	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Ind	I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
tr	Ind	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Ind	Kelly hit the nail on the head .
tr	Ind	""" Dr . Shady "" is a jerk ."
tr	Ind	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
tr	Ind	You have just lost mine .
tr	Ind	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Ind	Dr . Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
tr	Ind	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Ind	I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
tr	Ind	I did not have a good experience w / Dr . Ghassemlou .
tr	Ind	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Ind	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
tr	Ind	I learned more about this doing my own research afterward .
tr	Ind	I think he could ' ve done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
tr	Ind	Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
tr	Ind	It ' s pretty combative actually .
tr	Ind	I have had my back fused in 2 places .
tr	Ind	I wish that I hadn ' t done this .
tr	Ind	With these fusions , chiropractric isn ' t as successful , but it still is very helpful .
tr	Ind	Even after my fusions , my back continued to hurt , but now it doesn ' t hurt any more .
tr	Ind	I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr . de Barros .
tr	Ind	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Ind	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can ' t see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
tr	Ind	I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
tr	Ind	I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color )!
tr	Ind	"I regularly request Kim ' s business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!!"""
tr	Ind	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
tr	Ind	My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
tr	Ind	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
tr	Ind	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Ind	The service is fast .
tr	Ind	( it ' s by the door , on the hostess stand )
tr	Ind	I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
tr	Ind	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Ind	Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
tr	Ind	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
tr	Ind	I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband ' s funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
tr	Ind	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Ind	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
tr	Ind	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Ind	Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances .
tr	Ind	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Ind	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
tr	Ind	She recommended products but absolutely didn ' t pressure me to buy .
tr	Ind	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Ind	And students get $ 5 off , can ' t argue with that .
tr	Ind	Yeah , this complex is not very good .
tr	Ind	Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
tr	Ind	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
tr	Ind	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
tr	Ind	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
tr	Ind	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Ind	I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
tr	Ind	Chicken salad salad is great too .
tr	Ind	Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
tr	Ind	For the quality , the prices ($ 4 -$ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
tr	Ind	The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
tr	Ind	Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
tr	Ind	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Ind	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Ind	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Ind	He had a robe that was made back in the ' 60s .
tr	Ind	God was pleased with that one !
tr	Ind	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Ind	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Ind	ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
tr	Ind	me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
tr	Ind	i ' ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
tr	Ind	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Ind	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Ind	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
tr	Ind	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Ind	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
tr	Ind	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
tr	Ind	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Ind	I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
tr	Ind	The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
tr	Ind	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
tr	Ind	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren ' t paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
tr	Ind	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Ind	Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc . THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN ' T PAID .
tr	Ind	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
tr	Ind	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
tr	Ind	Tiffany is fabulous !
tr	Ind	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Ind	She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t even buy the bag there !
tr	Ind	Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don ' t have what you need .
tr	Ind	We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
tr	Ind	The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
tr	Ind	The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
tr	Ind	The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
tr	Ind	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Ind	We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
tr	Ind	Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
tr	Ind	We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
tr	Ind	Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long .
tr	Ind	I recommend La Hacienda
tr	Ind	Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
tr	Ind	Don ' t know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
tr	Ind	Cons : * Server wasn ' t very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
tr	Ind	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
tr	Ind	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Ind	Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that ' ll change my mind .... and a different server .
tr	Ind	the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
tr	Ind	i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
tr	Ind	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
tr	Ind	my experience with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
tr	Ind	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Ind	from start to finish they were top notch .
tr	Ind	This insurance co . Is a joke !!!
tr	Ind	They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
tr	Ind	if you don ' t mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
tr	Ind	They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
tr	Ind	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Ind	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Ind	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F %# king Assh @%$ e !!!
tr	Ind	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
tr	Ind	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Ind	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Ind	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
tr	Ind	I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need .
tr	Ind	Love my home at Creekside
tr	Ind	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Ind	The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp . Edwin , are just wonderful .
tr	Ind	They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
tr	Ind	Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
tr	Ind	I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
tr	Ind	The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe ' s , Whole Foods , and other stores .
tr	Ind	The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
tr	Ind	Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
tr	Ind	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
tr	Ind	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Ind	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
tr	Ind	I ' m glad I trusted my gut and didn ' t get sucked into doing business with them .
tr	Ind	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Ind	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Ind	If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
tr	Ind	( For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me !)
tr	Ind	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
tr	Ind	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
tr	Ind	My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
tr	Ind	In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
tr	Ind	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Ind	After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
tr	Ind	The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
tr	Ind	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Ind	Very affordable ( don ' t call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
tr	Ind	Dr . Mann killed our pet
tr	Ind	Yea , Dr . Mann ain ' t so great .
tr	Ind	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
tr	Ind	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Ind	If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
tr	Ind	Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ($ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
tr	Ind	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
tr	Ind	This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
tr	Ind	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Ind	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Ind	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Ind	in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
tr	Ind	I used to LOVE this place .
tr	Ind	But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
tr	Ind	I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them , they lost my car key .
tr	Ind	Lucky I had a spare with me !
tr	Ind	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
tr	Ind	( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you can ' t just go to WalMart .)
tr	Ind	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
tr	Ind	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
tr	Ind	We were told that we couldn ' t today because they were closing soon .
tr	Ind	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
tr	Ind	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Ind	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
tr	Ind	They refused .
tr	Ind	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Ind	College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE !
tr	Ind	Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
tr	Ind	You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
tr	Ind	You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate !
tr	Ind	Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont .
tr	Ind	Staff is under educated .
tr	Ind	Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
tr	Ind	This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
tr	Ind	They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
tr	Ind	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Ind	On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
tr	Ind	You won ' t even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
tr	Ind	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
tr	Ind	I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
tr	Ind	Oh , and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas .
tr	Ind	Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
tr	Ind	I guess you get what you pay for .
tr	Ind	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
tr	Ind	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Ind	Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
tr	Ind	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
tr	Ind	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
tr	Ind	"When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had "" reserved """
tr	Ind	I was thoroughly impressed !
tr	Ind	I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
tr	Ind	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren ' t the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
tr	Ind	The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company ' s were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
tr	Ind	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Ind	We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
tr	Ind	Best money I ' ve spent on remodeling ever .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
tr	Ind	New training Centre is excellent
tr	Ind	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
tr	Ind	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
tr	Ind	The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
tr	Ind	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
tr	Ind	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Ind	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Ind	The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
tr	Ind	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Ind	I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
tr	Ind	( But this is a certified car from a dealer .)
tr	Ind	So I brought the car back the second day .
tr	Ind	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
tr	Ind	Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
tr	Ind	I walked away .
tr	Ind	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
tr	Ind	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Ind	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
tr	Ind	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Ind	My dental surgeon , Dr . Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
tr	Ind	Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....
tr	Ind	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Ind	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Ind	We were also served salad and soda .
tr	Ind	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Ind	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Ind	I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
tr	Ind	I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
tr	Ind	I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
tr	Ind	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
tr	Ind	Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
tr	Ind	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
tr	Ind	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Ind	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
tr	Ind	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Ind	It wasn ' t completly impossible !!!!
tr	Ind	I am definitely going back
tr	Ind	After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner .
tr	Ind	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
tr	Ind	The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
tr	Ind	The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
tr	Ind	After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
tr	Ind	This was a less than impressive experience at Trio ' s .
tr	Ind	One night was too much .
tr	Ind	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Ind	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Ind	"I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "" This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton "" and the receptionist then hung up on me ."
tr	Ind	To warn you to stay away from this place just isn ' t enough .
tr	Ind	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Ind	Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software .
tr	Ind	We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
tr	Ind	Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
tr	Ind	Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time .
tr	Ind	How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
tr	Ind	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
tr	Ind	Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before .
tr	Ind	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
tr	Ind	Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day ' s training
tr	Ind	On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
tr	Ind	This is by far the BEST B & B that we have ever stayed at !
tr	Ind	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
tr	Ind	The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
tr	Ind	Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
tr	Ind	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Ind	Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
tr	Ind	A & E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
tr	Ind	I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
tr	Ind	The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A & E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A & E does not ).
tr	Ind	Their quote came in at half the price of A & E for the same work and same part .
tr	Ind	Seems to me like A & E charges way more than necessary !
tr	Ind	Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre - screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
tr	Ind	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
tr	Ind	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
tr	Ind	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
tr	Ind	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Ind	He did warm it up .
tr	Ind	He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
tr	Ind	If the pedicure lasted 20 mins ., that was a stretch .
tr	Ind	The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
tr	Ind	None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
tr	Ind	Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
tr	Ind	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Ind	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Ind	The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
tr	Ind	I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
tr	Ind	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
tr	Ind	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Ind	( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...)
tr	Ind	The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
tr	Ind	Common room was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . –
tr	Ind	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9 : 30am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
tr	Ind	Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we didn ' t mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
tr	Ind	The location is really stellar !
tr	Ind	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Ind	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Ind	We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
tr	Ind	Just Autos Thank you !
tr	Ind	Was fast and easy , Just had our car returned this morning , I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure .
tr	Ind	They certainly know what they are doing .
tr	Ind	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ).
tr	Ind	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Ind	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever its like driving a new car .
tr	Ind	So yes , I wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
tr	Ind	I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
tr	Ind	I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
tr	Ind	I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
tr	Ind	All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
tr	Ind	After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , its less dry & smoother !
tr	Ind	If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out !
tr	Ind	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
tr	Ind	I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!!!
tr	Ind	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Ind	A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
tr	Ind	Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
tr	Ind	There could have ( hopefully doesn ' t have ) major damage to the engine .
tr	Ind	All of this started after their oil change .
tr	Ind	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife ' s work and towed it back to fix it .
tr	Ind	Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
tr	Ind	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
tr	Ind	I wonder if they were going down a hill !
tr	Ind	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
tr	Ind	I brought it back with 9000 miles .
tr	Ind	"They "" finished "" the work and told me the car was ready ."
tr	Ind	I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
tr	Ind	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
tr	Ind	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
tr	Ind	Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
tr	Ind	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Ind	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Ind	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Ind	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
tr	Ind	Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
tr	Ind	Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .
tr	Ind	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Ind	We signed our name in about 6 : 00pm .
tr	Ind	There were 3 names before us .
tr	Ind	The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
tr	Ind	However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
tr	Ind	This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “ no reservation , sign your name here ”.
tr	Ind	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Ind	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
tr	Ind	My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
tr	Ind	Instructor never showed up !
tr	Ind	"January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday ' s 2 PM class "" Beginning Yoga with Brittany ."""
tr	Ind	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Ind	The instructor did not show up !
tr	Ind	We waited until 2 : 25 PM and then left .
tr	Ind	There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
tr	Ind	Well , not much I can say except I ' m very disappointed with this experience .
tr	Ind	This was our first visit to your studio .
tr	Ind	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Ind	As a yoga studio , I ' m sure you ' re all aware that all actions generate karma …
tr	Ind	I beg to differ .
tr	Ind	This place is marginal at best .
tr	Ind	I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
tr	Ind	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Ind	I don ' t want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I don ' t want to take on something I can ' t handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
tr	Ind	These guys were the best .
tr	Ind	They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
tr	Ind	We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
tr	Ind	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Ind	Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !
tr	Ind	They may look young but don ' t let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
tr	Ind	I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80 ' s , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960 ' s .
tr	Ind	So we didn ' t expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
tr	Ind	They just really know their stuff !
tr	Ind	I ' m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
tr	Ind	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
tr	Ind	My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
tr	Ind	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
tr	Ind	At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
tr	Ind	I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
tr	Ind	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
tr	Ind	They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
tr	Ind	I never felt pain or discomfort .
tr	Ind	Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
tr	Ind	not only is this place too expensive for what it is , its horrible !
tr	Ind	In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin !), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
tr	Ind	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Ind	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Ind	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Ind	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
tr	Ind	Texas Roadhouse is WAY better !!
tr	Ind	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
tr	Ind	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Ind	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Ind	You ' d think they would do a good job but they don ' t care unless they are getting paid full price .
tr	Ind	Which is so dumb .
tr	Ind	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
tr	Ind	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
tr	Ind	My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
tr	Ind	Then I got a bill for $ 483 . 00 .
tr	Ind	"The doctor ' s office said that payments had been "" reversed ""."
tr	Ind	Blue cross has no record of aa reversal .
tr	Ind	The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC / BS .
tr	Ind	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
tr	Ind	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160 . 00 has come through .
tr	Ind	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Ind	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
tr	Ind	I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
tr	Ind	We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
tr	Ind	We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
tr	Ind	They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
tr	Ind	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Ind	They did that with no problem .
tr	Ind	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
tr	Ind	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
tr	Ind	They recently surprised me a larger order .
tr	Ind	I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
tr	Ind	Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
tr	Ind	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
tr	Ind	They have a customer for life in us !
tr	Ind	i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
tr	Ind	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
tr	Ind	"Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "" There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck ""."
tr	Ind	Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
tr	Ind	Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
tr	Ind	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Ind	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
tr	Ind	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Ind	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
tr	Ind	Grimy work you guys do .
tr	Ind	Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
tr	Ind	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell ' s .
tr	Ind	I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
tr	Ind	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Ind	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Ind	I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
tr	Ind	This company is overpriced for their services .
tr	Ind	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
tr	Ind	On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
tr	Ind	The craziest part is that they aren ' t even based locally at the city I ' m in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
tr	Ind	I ' ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
tr	Ind	This is THE premier university in Virginia .
tr	Ind	It is also the largest .
tr	Ind	With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chilis , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
tr	Ind	VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
tr	Ind	The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
tr	Ind	VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
tr	Ind	VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
tr	Ind	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
tr	Ind	The U of R is also recommended , too !
tr	Ind	Orr ' s a nightmare !
tr	Ind	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who ' d arrived around 1 : 00 am and were drinking at the springs .
tr	Ind	When we complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any problems ), nothing happened !
tr	Ind	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Ind	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Ind	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Ind	To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
tr	Ind	FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
tr	Ind	I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
tr	Ind	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ).
tr	Ind	Now , of course , there ' s a new building , with presumably better facilities .
tr	Ind	For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
tr	Ind	If I remember , students went to Dartmouth , U . Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others .
tr	Ind	Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program .
tr	Ind	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Ind	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Ind	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
tr	Ind	The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
tr	Ind	There ' s a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
tr	Ind	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Ind	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Ind	I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
tr	Ind	I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and can ' t stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I ' m in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
tr	Ind	The place is chill and comfortable .
tr	Ind	They don ' t speak the best English but enough to get by .
tr	Ind	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Ind	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
tr	Ind	And their breakfast is awesome !!
tr	Ind	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
tr	Ind	I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
tr	Ind	I ' ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance )...
tr	Ind	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
tr	Ind	I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
tr	Ind	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
tr	Ind	Not what i expected !
tr	Ind	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Ind	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Ind	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Ind	Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
tr	Ind	On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
tr	Ind	Wouldn ' t go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
tr	Ind	Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
tr	Ind	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
tr	Ind	The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
tr	Ind	They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
tr	Ind	They don ' t just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
tr	Ind	The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
tr	Ind	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Ind	Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
tr	Ind	Prices are reasonable , ( Kids meals are around 4 . 99 ) and Wednesday ' s they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
tr	Ind	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Ind	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Ind	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Ind	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Ind	And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well !)
tr	Ind	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Ind	I am a college student .
tr	Ind	"Before treatment , my food cravings were "" out of control "" which caused me to be stressed out ."
tr	Ind	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Ind	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
tr	Ind	I was amazed .
tr	Ind	I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
tr	Ind	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend ' s aunt recommended it .
tr	Ind	It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
tr	Ind	What I like most about Dr . Liau is that she is very caring .
tr	Ind	She talks to you at each appointment .
tr	Ind	I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
tr	Ind	I am SO GLAD to have found Dr . Liau .
tr	Ind	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
tr	Ind	For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
tr	Ind	Bowtie has filled that role nicely .
tr	Ind	The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
tr	Ind	The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
tr	Ind	The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
tr	Ind	There ' s plenty of parking , and I ' ve never had an issue with audience members who won ' t stop talking or answering their cellphones .
tr	Ind	Best of all , there are no ads !!!!!
tr	Ind	But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
tr	Ind	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
tr	Ind	Thank you , Bowtie !
tr	Ind	My first visit was so fun yesterday .
tr	Ind	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
tr	Ind	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
tr	Ind	The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
tr	Ind	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Ind	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Ind	This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
tr	Ind	By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
tr	Ind	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
tr	Ind	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Ind	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
tr	Ind	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
tr	Ind	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Ind	"We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , "" was I gotta have it !"""
tr	Ind	I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier .
tr	Ind	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
tr	Ind	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Ind	Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
tr	Ind	No problem , sounded like it ' s done every day .
tr	Ind	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Ind	Are they serious ?
tr	Ind	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Ind	Either these people don ' t know anything about what they are renting , or worse - they are bait and switching .
tr	Ind	One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry .
tr	Ind	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Ind	Yes , there are bigger , but bigger isn ' t necessarily better .
tr	Ind	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Ind	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
tr	Ind	Didn ' t hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
tr	Ind	"Whereas my answer to the question "" Where do you get your laundry done ?"" used to be , "" At the checkout line at WalMart ,"" I can honestly say the answer now is , "" At The Laundry Tub ."""
tr	Ind	Thank you !
tr	Ind	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
tr	Ind	They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
tr	Ind	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Ind	lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
tr	Ind	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Ind	I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
tr	Ind	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
tr	Ind	Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
tr	Ind	Okay , here ' s the scoop .
tr	Ind	I ' ma regular at the HH .
tr	Ind	The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
tr	Ind	I think they ' re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
tr	Ind	In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ).
tr	Ind	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Ind	In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just doesn ' t care / know better .
tr	Ind	They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it ' s not room temperature at best when you get it home .
tr	Ind	You just have to know what you ' re getting into when you go .
tr	Ind	I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
tr	Ind	the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
tr	Ind	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
tr	Ind	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
tr	Ind	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical !
tr	Ind	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
tr	Ind	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Ind	When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
tr	Ind	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Ind	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Ind	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Ind	The other rolls weren ' t at all special , especially given their pricing .
tr	Ind	The bottom line is that the food isn ' t great and is relatively high - priced .
tr	Ind	The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
tr	Ind	But I ' d go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
tr	Ind	It ' s just not worth it .
tr	Ind	I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
tr	Ind	At 3 : 15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
tr	Ind	These are not household type alarms .
tr	Ind	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Ind	I called the front desk and got no answer .
tr	Ind	After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none , I decided to just pack up and leave .
tr	Ind	The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ?).
tr	Ind	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Ind	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Ind	This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
tr	Ind	Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
tr	Ind	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Ind	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
tr	Ind	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Ind	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Ind	The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
tr	Ind	When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
tr	Ind	That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
tr	Ind	So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started .
tr	Ind	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Ind	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Ind	One more thing , they don ' t take any credit cards or checks .
tr	Ind	You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
tr	Ind	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Ind	Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
tr	Ind	We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
tr	Ind	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Ind	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Ind	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
tr	Ind	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Ind	He was referred to me by a friend , who didn ' t have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
tr	Ind	I figure I would give this company a chance .
tr	Ind	However , after giving a required $ 500 . 00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
tr	Ind	We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
tr	Ind	He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
tr	Ind	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
tr	Ind	WHAT IS THAT ?????
tr	Ind	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
tr	Ind	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
tr	Ind	"When we walked in , the person behind desk said : "" oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something ."""
tr	Ind	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Ind	Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
tr	Ind	I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
tr	Ind	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Ind	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
tr	Ind	"When I inquired he rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out you ' ll get it back ."""
tr	Ind	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Ind	I also mentioned to the reception person .
tr	Ind	"He responded "" we have problem with ' people '""."
tr	Ind	I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
tr	Ind	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Ind	We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
tr	Ind	I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
tr	Ind	My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
tr	Ind	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
tr	Ind	Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
tr	Ind	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
tr	Ind	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
tr	Ind	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn ' t budge .
tr	Ind	Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
tr	Ind	I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
tr	Ind	I emailed 4 times , never a response .
tr	Ind	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet ' s that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
tr	Ind	I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
tr	Ind	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
tr	Ind	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
tr	Ind	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
tr	Ind	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
tr	Ind	I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
tr	Ind	Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
tr	Ind	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Ind	I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
tr	Ind	They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
tr	Ind	So I ordered a slice .
tr	Ind	It tasted like I just flew back home .
tr	Ind	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Ind	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
tr	Ind	That being said , I don ' t know how their delivery service is .
tr	Ind	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
tr	Ind	We visited on 7 / 26 / 08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia ' s on Greenfield Ave .
tr	Ind	The food was good , and so was our waitress .
tr	Ind	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Ind	I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
tr	Ind	The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
tr	Ind	Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
tr	Ind	Sorry for interrupting I guess .
tr	Ind	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Ind	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Ind	There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
tr	Ind	TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
tr	Ind	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
tr	Ind	ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
tr	Ind	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Ind	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
tr	Ind	I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
tr	Ind	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
tr	Ind	I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
tr	Ind	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Ind	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Ind	BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
tr	Ind	their mezza luna ' s are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
tr	Ind	its like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
tr	Ind	it seems like its healthier too , but its prolly not .
tr	Ind	that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting .
tr	Ind	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Ind	their pizza was a little salty for me , but its still good .
tr	Ind	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Ind	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
tr	Ind	** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , I have had food delivered before .
tr	Ind	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Ind	Perhaps they don ' t deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
tr	Ind	My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100 , 000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
tr	Ind	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Ind	Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
tr	Ind	I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
tr	Ind	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Ind	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
tr	Ind	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
tr	Ind	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
tr	Ind	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Ind	I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
tr	Ind	That ' s all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
tr	Ind	Myself and my fiance ' s identity was stolen from the office staff .
tr	Ind	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
tr	Ind	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
tr	Ind	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Ind	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
tr	Ind	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Ind	Thats how they were caught .
tr	Ind	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
tr	Ind	The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
tr	Ind	Nobody lived there .
tr	Ind	My apartment was usually quiet .
tr	Ind	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
tr	Ind	Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
tr	Ind	It sucked having an SUV .
tr	Ind	If I found a spot , I couldnt fit in it .
tr	Ind	Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
tr	Ind	Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
tr	Ind	The best there is in service .
tr	Ind	I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
tr	Ind	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Ind	Not only did they answer the phone at 4 : 50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
tr	Ind	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Ind	They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6 : 30 that evening .
tr	Ind	It ' s without a doubt , the best service experience I ' ve ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville ' s price for putting on the other rear tire .
tr	Ind	I hope I can return the favor in the future !
tr	Ind	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Ind	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Ind	I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get .
tr	Ind	I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call .
tr	Ind	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Ind	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Ind	"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" you do not order what you do not know about "" and "" you don ' t know how pizza is made ""."
tr	Ind	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Ind	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
tr	Ind	Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy .
tr	Ind	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn ' t so well - done ( actually , burnt ).
tr	Ind	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
tr	Ind	THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
tr	Ind	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my * ss .
tr	Ind	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
tr	Ind	I mean , that ' s the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
tr	Ind	"The staff taking your order and "" waiting "" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all ."
tr	Ind	I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
tr	Ind	"If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are "" ok ,"" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
tr	Ind	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
tr	Ind	Wish this was in Saratoga --
tr	Ind	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
tr	Ind	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
tr	Ind	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Ind	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
tr	Ind	Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
tr	Ind	This chef knows what he is doing .
tr	Ind	I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
tr	Ind	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Ind	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Ind	I think that there pretty good .
tr	Ind	First of all , if you call for an appointment they won ' t tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
tr	Ind	"They also don ' t tell you that they ' re going to mail you an "" application "" to be admitted to be a patient ."
tr	Ind	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Ind	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that ' s a common misconception ( http :// www . consumerreports . org / health / healthy - living / beauty - personal - care / hair - loss - 10 - 08 / hair - loss . htm ).
tr	Ind	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
tr	Ind	But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
tr	Ind	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Ind	If you want miracles you ' ll have to go to 21st St .
tr	Ind	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Ind	They don ' t do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
tr	Ind	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
tr	Ind	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
tr	Ind	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
tr	Ind	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
tr	Ind	From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
tr	Ind	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
tr	Ind	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
tr	Ind	Update : I had to add to my review .
tr	Ind	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
tr	Ind	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
tr	Ind	"Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
tr	Ind	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Ind	We were greeted again and sat promptly .
tr	Ind	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
tr	Ind	I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
tr	Ind	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
tr	Ind	I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
tr	Ind	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Ind	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Ind	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Ind	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
tr	Ind	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Ind	The service was excellent and personable .
tr	Ind	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
tr	Ind	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car .
tr	Ind	Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
tr	Ind	That is just unheard of these days !
tr	Ind	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
tr	Ind	He is my mechanic going forward !
tr	Ind	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
tr	Ind	We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
tr	Ind	We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
tr	Ind	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Ind	2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
tr	Ind	How has it gone so far ?
tr	Ind	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Ind	We are absolutely confident that Stuart ' s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
tr	Ind	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Ind	I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
tr	Ind	The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that ' s not why I ' m writing my review .
tr	Ind	Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
tr	Ind	The intruders slit the screen of the window .
tr	Ind	Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
tr	Ind	The window didn ' t break !
tr	Ind	My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind !).
tr	Ind	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Ind	Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and didn ' t charge me a dime .
tr	Ind	Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
tr	Ind	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Ind	I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone ' s business !
tr	Ind	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
tr	Ind	Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1 : 00 am !
tr	Ind	Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
tr	Ind	There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
tr	Ind	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Ind	A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
tr	Ind	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Ind	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
tr	Ind	"A mid - afternoon "" fire drill "" was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel ."
tr	Ind	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Ind	The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
tr	Ind	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
tr	Ind	My experience was awful though .
tr	Ind	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Ind	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Ind	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Ind	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Ind	After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
tr	Ind	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Ind	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which isn ' t true .
tr	Ind	I mean , I don ' t care if he doesn ' t know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there ' s no way I ' m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
tr	Ind	The Worst Chinese I ' ve Ever Had
tr	Ind	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Ind	The service stunk .
tr	Ind	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone elses .
tr	Ind	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
tr	Ind	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
tr	Ind	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Ind	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order .
tr	Ind	Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
tr	Ind	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
tr	Ind	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Ind	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
tr	Ind	The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
tr	Ind	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
tr	Ind	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Ind	One of the worst experiences I ' ve ever had with a auto repair shop .
tr	Ind	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
tr	Ind	Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
tr	Ind	We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
tr	Ind	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Ind	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Ind	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Ind	He stood there and told us how he wasn ' t at fault .
tr	Ind	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Ind	And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
tr	Ind	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Ind	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Ind	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
tr	Ind	I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
tr	Ind	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
tr	Ind	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Ind	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Ind	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Ind	I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
tr	Ind	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Ind	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
tr	Ind	I explained I did not get what I paid for .
tr	Ind	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Ind	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Ind	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
tr	Ind	With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
tr	Ind	There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
tr	Ind	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner ' s own unprofessionalism .
tr	Ind	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Ind	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Ind	Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun .
tr	Ind	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
tr	Ind	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
tr	Ind	Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away .
tr	Ind	The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
tr	Ind	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Ind	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club ' s actual OWNER ?!
tr	Ind	I was appalled .
tr	Ind	The equipment and classes aren ' t good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
tr	Ind	There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
tr	Ind	I feel obligated to share this story .
tr	Ind	Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
tr	Ind	Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
tr	Ind	I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don ' t show up , they ' ll charge you .
tr	Ind	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
tr	Ind	"After he already put product on my hair he said "" I should warn you , I ' m expensive ."""
tr	Ind	What was I supposed to do , say I can ' t afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair .
tr	Ind	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Ind	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Ind	$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
tr	Ind	Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
tr	Ind	I cried the entire way home .
tr	Ind	"He then "" fixed "" it for free but it still looked like crap ."
tr	Ind	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
tr	Ind	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
tr	Ind	That ' s my favorite show of all time .
tr	Ind	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Ind	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Ind	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
tr	Ind	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
tr	Ind	However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
tr	Ind	I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
tr	Ind	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Ind	Well , that was strike one .
tr	Ind	I wasn ' t going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
tr	Ind	However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6 , 000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
tr	Ind	Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
tr	Ind	He said yes .
tr	Ind	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Ind	I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
tr	Ind	In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
tr	Ind	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
tr	Ind	Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
tr	Ind	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
tr	Ind	( They even got me a couch pretty quickly .)
tr	Ind	The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi - sketchiness .
tr	Ind	Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
tr	Ind	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Ind	The other person working at the store didn ' t know that I still had this table coming .
tr	Ind	I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
tr	Ind	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
tr	Ind	I waited .
tr	Ind	And waited .
tr	Ind	He never once contacted us .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
tr	Ind	He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and didn ' t seem terribly apologetic .
tr	Ind	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Ind	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Ind	My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
tr	Ind	On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
tr	Ind	After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces .
tr	Ind	I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
tr	Ind	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Ind	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Ind	How do you lose a drawer .
tr	Ind	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Ind	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture .
tr	Ind	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
tr	Ind	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone ' s warehouse .
tr	Ind	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
tr	Ind	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
tr	Ind	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Ind	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
tr	Ind	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Ind	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Ind	My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !
tr	Ind	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn ' t feel comfortable driving an SUV .
tr	Ind	"Gerry pleasantly said "" since I am already here why don ' t we give it shot ."
tr	Ind	I trust you and believe that you ' ll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
tr	Ind	....... the rest was history !
tr	Ind	Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
tr	Ind	"To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !"
tr	Ind	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
tr	Ind	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Ind	But we don ' t just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
tr	Ind	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
tr	Ind	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Ind	We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back .
tr	Ind	They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
tr	Ind	We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
tr	Ind	And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
tr	Ind	Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
tr	Ind	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
tr	Ind	The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
tr	Ind	They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
tr	Ind	You don ' t have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
tr	Ind	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Ind	"PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "" all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and I will tell you that I don ' t know these people except from eating at their restaurant ."
tr	Ind	We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
tr	Ind	So that comment is completely false .
tr	Ind	Because we think IT ' S THE BEST !!!
tr	Ind	and we don ' t know them except for eating there .
tr	Ind	Dr . Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
tr	Ind	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Ind	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
tr	Ind	I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
tr	Ind	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Ind	"He later said that by 2 months he "" meant at least two months ""."
tr	Ind	Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
tr	Ind	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
tr	Ind	A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
tr	Ind	He also never even said he was sorry .
tr	Ind	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
tr	Ind	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Ind	I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
tr	Ind	I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
tr	Ind	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Ind	He said it sarcastically .
tr	Ind	I ' d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they don ' t just take every dog coming in .
tr	Ind	I ' ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
tr	Ind	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Ind	But I ' ve done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I don ' t work here ), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
tr	Ind	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Ind	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Ind	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Ind	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Ind	No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so isn ' t it reasonable to think they might know what they ' re doing ?
tr	Ind	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Ind	I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
tr	Ind	So I say : I ' m at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
tr	Ind	They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
tr	Ind	I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I ' m at the Radison - Warwick .
tr	Ind	And he says : You ' re at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
tr	Ind	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Ind	I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
tr	Ind	He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I ' m in PHILLY .
tr	Ind	I SAY LISTEN : I ' m at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
tr	Ind	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Ind	OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
tr	Ind	he says : Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
tr	Ind	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Ind	YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
tr	Ind	Yes , I say .
tr	Ind	17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
tr	Ind	You ' re at 7th .
tr	Ind	I am just south of Walnut .
tr	Ind	She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
tr	Ind	YES , I am west of broad .
tr	Ind	Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
tr	Ind	Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we don ' t go past broad ?
tr	Ind	Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno ' s .
tr	Ind	B & B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
tr	Ind	They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
tr	Ind	"Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year !""."
tr	Ind	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
tr	Ind	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
tr	Ind	We heard nothing .
tr	Ind	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Ind	I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
tr	Ind	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Ind	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Ind	I WAS calling about one board !!
tr	Ind	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Ind	So I figure if they don ' t want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I ' ll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
tr	Ind	YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
tr	Ind	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
tr	Ind	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Ind	Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
tr	Ind	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Ind	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Ind	They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
tr	Ind	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
tr	Ind	The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
tr	Ind	In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
tr	Ind	However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ).
tr	Ind	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M , no exceptions .
tr	Ind	Then she was gone .
tr	Ind	We returned after 3PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
tr	Ind	Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
tr	Ind	If they think you ' ve taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1 . 50 per can .
tr	Ind	They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
tr	Ind	# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
tr	Ind	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Ind	# 4 ) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM .
tr	Ind	If you go later , it ' s all cleaned up .
tr	Ind	( By whom , I don ' t know .
tr	Ind	I never saw anyone there .
tr	Ind	All these rules are posted in the rooms .)
tr	Ind	Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that didn ' t exist .
tr	Ind	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
tr	Ind	Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that didn ' t work .
tr	Ind	Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems .
tr	Ind	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
tr	Ind	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
tr	Ind	"The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "" everyone "" is going to "" love "" the food , decor and service ."
tr	Ind	The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
tr	Ind	It ' s an entirely up and down experience , however .
tr	Ind	Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
tr	Ind	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).
tr	Ind	Though they are mostly excellent , you generally don ' t get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
tr	Ind	That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
tr	Ind	Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ).
tr	Ind	Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
tr	Ind	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
tr	Ind	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Ind	Dessert was ... hmmm , that ' s interesting , I don ' t even remember dessert .
tr	Ind	I guess that tells you a lot .
tr	Ind	Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
tr	Ind	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
tr	Ind	And my -- no , I still don ' t remember what I had .
tr	Ind	Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
tr	Ind	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Ind	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you ' ve never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
tr	Ind	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Ind	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Ind	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
tr	Ind	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .
tr	Ind	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
tr	Ind	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Ind	So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
tr	Ind	"They said they were "" unable to tell me until they ordered my dress ""."
tr	Ind	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Ind	Do other brides fall for this ???
tr	Ind	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Ind	I ' m no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
tr	Ind	Whatever type of operation they are running , I ' m not interested and if you ' re smart , you won ' t be either .
tr	Ind	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Ind	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Ind	"I didn ' t think so but you could be right ."""
tr	Ind	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
tr	Ind	Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners .
tr	Ind	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
tr	Ind	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn ' t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
tr	Ind	After happily visiting Sear ' s Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
tr	Ind	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
tr	Ind	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Ind	Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
tr	Ind	Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
tr	Ind	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn ' t possible .
tr	Ind	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Ind	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Ind	I would not have gone back , but I couldn ' t find the particular tire they ' d used in stock anywhere else .
tr	Ind	Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
tr	Ind	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Ind	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Ind	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Ind	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Ind	So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
tr	Ind	They promised it ' d be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
tr	Ind	Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
tr	Ind	"A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that "" I "" left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car )."
tr	Ind	The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
tr	Ind	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Ind	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Ind	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
tr	Ind	The employees at this Sear ' s are completely apathetic and there didn ' t seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
tr	Ind	I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ).

tr	Imp	If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .
tr	Imp	Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
tr	Imp	Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth .
tr	Imp	Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the air flowing through your nostrils .
tr	Imp	Continue to breathe slowly and deeply .
tr	Imp	Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .
tr	Imp	Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
tr	Imp	Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ), the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
tr	Imp	Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea .
tr	Imp	Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
tr	Imp	And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ).
tr	Imp	Try this for 5 to 10 minutes .
tr	Imp	Now come back to earth again - slowly .
tr	Imp	Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .
tr	Imp	Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
tr	Imp	With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
tr	Imp	Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .
tr	Imp	Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
tr	Imp	Let your mind and body be totally at peace .
tr	Imp	Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .
tr	Imp	Open your eyes .
tr	Imp	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Imp	Feel that you ' re sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
tr	Imp	Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction .
tr	Imp	Feel you ' re completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
tr	Imp	Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
tr	Imp	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Imp	Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you ' re repeating it .
tr	Imp	Feel you ' re surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
tr	Imp	Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .
tr	Imp	Don ' t worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that ' s normal .
tr	Imp	Well maybe a miracle could happen , but lets face it we ' re ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !
tr	Imp	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
tr	Imp	If you have any questions please feel free to call me ( after Sat . the 26th , when I will return from a trip ).

tr	Imp	Enjoy it while you can , and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time .
tr	Imp	Have a look at this , it may help .
tr	Imp	Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you ' ll be fine .
tr	Imp	Remember that you get what you pay for .
tr	Imp	See link below .
tr	Imp	Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
tr	Imp	But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere .
tr	Imp	so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40K at least .
tr	Imp	Yes , but be sure that your chickens are all hens ( I mean not roosters ), Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving , so be aware of that , hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !
tr	Imp	Be sure not to feed your rabbits non - veg items !
tr	Imp	So , don ' t put both of them in one cage .
tr	Imp	So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
tr	Imp	Lay some knowledge on them dude .
tr	Imp	Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
tr	Imp	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Imp	Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
tr	Imp	Be persistent , but don ' t pester them about it cause that ' ll get you nowhere fast .
tr	Imp	My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
tr	Imp	1 . Be responsible .
tr	Imp	Do all your chores without being nagged , take care of any existing pets , keep your room clean , and so on .
tr	Imp	Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
tr	Imp	2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
tr	Imp	3 . Bargain with them .
tr	Imp	Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
tr	Imp	4 . Play the sympathy card .
tr	Imp	On the fear angle -- talk her into coming to the pet store with you .
tr	Imp	Once you ' re there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
tr	Imp	Once you ' re holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
tr	Imp	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
tr	Imp	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
tr	Imp	My opinion - take it for what it ' s worth … :-)
tr	Imp	Start your process here , if you haven ' t already .
tr	Imp	Lets be clear about this ...........
tr	Imp	So don ' t pack your bags , yet .
tr	Imp	Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
tr	Imp	Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .
tr	Imp	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Imp	Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
tr	Imp	And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold .
tr	Imp	Never train out of fear .
tr	Imp	Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
tr	Imp	or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
tr	Imp	try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
tr	Imp	Also , while travelling ask people where they ' ve been and if they have any hotel recommendations .
tr	Imp	( Dont stay in Agra too long .
tr	Imp	Good luck , enjoy your time !
tr	Imp	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Imp	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Imp	Make certain you get two females .
tr	Imp	Don ' t feed them broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest .
tr	Imp	Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring .
tr	Imp	If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
tr	Imp	Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
tr	Imp	Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator .
tr	Imp	Then take care of yourself .
tr	Imp	Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
tr	Imp	Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
tr	Imp	Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
tr	Imp	If you still don ' t enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
tr	Imp	Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back !
tr	Imp	And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
tr	Imp	Take the kittens back to the shelter .
tr	Imp	Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
tr	Imp	None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .

tr	Imp	close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
tr	Imp	let him out for half an hour , to explore .
tr	Imp	then put him back in .
tr	Imp	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Imp	remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
tr	Imp	remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
tr	Imp	Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
tr	Imp	Maybe get a book on training .
tr	Imp	Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
tr	Imp	Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
tr	Imp	Later do it again .
tr	Imp	When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
tr	Imp	Put something fun inside .
tr	Imp	Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason .
tr	Imp	Do not shut the door .
tr	Imp	Let him walk in and out for a few days .
tr	Imp	Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
tr	Imp	With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
tr	Imp	Try obedience classes .
tr	Imp	Have patience with him , you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home .
tr	Imp	And don ' t expect to party on this tour .
tr	Imp	have fun .
tr	Imp	PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken ' s hotel .
tr	Imp	Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
tr	Imp	i wouldn ' t bother with yoga i ' d practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , theres also a way to ride on your knees ?
tr	Imp	with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it ' s forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
tr	Imp	3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
tr	Imp	4 ) Call your vet .
tr	Imp	Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
tr	Imp	Try living in Sydney on a teacher ' s salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
tr	Imp	Get an education !
tr	Imp	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Imp	Remember snakes can go awhile without eating .
tr	Imp	put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
tr	Imp	then let her out for ten minutes .
tr	Imp	make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
tr	Imp	give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
tr	Imp	if that happens , separate them , and give them time apart .
tr	Imp	Try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
tr	Imp	"Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "" light ,"" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
tr	Imp	Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach .
tr	Imp	Please help me !
tr	Imp	oh and please say y one is better thx !!!!!!
tr	Imp	Please choose the parakeet ...
tr	Imp	When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
tr	Imp	( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ).
tr	Imp	Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
tr	Imp	( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
tr	Imp	But get either one male and one female , or two males .
tr	Imp	Do not get two females .
tr	Imp	However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
tr	Imp	1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
tr	Imp	Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
tr	Imp	2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .
tr	Imp	Do this for about one hour .
tr	Imp	Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .
tr	Imp	Push you finger to their feet gently and say up .
tr	Imp	Do not hit , yell , or harm them .
tr	Imp	Dont give up !
tr	Imp	Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
tr	Imp	If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .

tr	Imp	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Imp	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Imp	But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
tr	Imp	Get those out ASAP too .
tr	Imp	Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
tr	Imp	Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there .
tr	Imp	Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
tr	Imp	Ok , calm down , it ' s not like he ' s some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
tr	Imp	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
tr	Imp	If so go for it and I ' ll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .

tr	Imp	MUST TRY !!!
tr	Imp	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I ' m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
tr	Imp	If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia .

va	Ind	From the AP comes this story :
va	Ind	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .
va	Ind	Bush nominated Jennifer M . Anderson for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , replacing Steffen W . Graae .
va	Ind	Bush also nominated A . Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals , replacing John Montague Steadman .
va	Ind	The sheikh in wheel - chair has been attacked with a F - 16 - launched bomb .
va	Ind	He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they didn ' t .
va	Ind	Today ' s incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace .
va	Ind	Nervous people make mistakes , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks .
va	Ind	In the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station , killing several people .
va	Ind	The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe .
va	Ind	In Fallujah , hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride .
va	Ind	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Ind	The US troops fired into the hostile crowd , killing 4 .
va	Ind	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Ind	Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company ' s story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who haven ' t heard it .
va	Ind	Usually , these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up , but this time people are actually concerned about the company ' s plans .
va	Ind	"They work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company who ' s stated goals include "" Don ' t be evil ,"" they imagine a company who ' s eventually history will be "" Don ' t be profitable ."""
va	Ind	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Ind	My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat ' s passing for al - Qaeda has appeared at Newsday .
va	Ind	""" Arafat ' s secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky ."
va	Ind	The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
va	Ind	Arafat ' s death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled .
va	Ind	Sharon ' s assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party .
va	Ind	If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership cannot find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues .
va	Ind	Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
va	Ind	Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon ' s murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before .
va	Ind	"The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , "" condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq ."""
va	Ind	Ash - Sharq al - Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike .
va	Ind	US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead .
va	Ind	In Ramadi , there was a big demonstration .
va	Ind	"Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was "" criminal "" and that "" the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad ""."
va	Ind	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Ind	"This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region ,"" the message claimed ."
va	Ind	"Xinhua alleged that "" Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation ."""
va	Ind	In an apparently unrelated incidents , some eleven Iraqis were killed by snipers on Tuesday , including a group of police trainees in a bus near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk .
va	Ind	Ever since the first whispers about Google ' s IPO , most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that , even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution , the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit .
va	Ind	We ' ve moved on .
va	Ind	We ' ve grown up .
va	Ind	Now , people wonder if Google can even survive .
va	Ind	That ' s overstating it , I know .
va	Ind	What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it ' s always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
va	Ind	Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
va	Ind	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
va	Ind	It ' s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
va	Ind	As the survey cited in the above - linked article shows , most Google users don ' t intend to use Gmail , and Google isn ' t even as popular as Yahoo ! and AOL .
va	Ind	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
va	Ind	Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
va	Ind	Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
va	Ind	Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
va	Ind	An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
va	Ind	""" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in ,"" Masoud Shojai , head of the country ' s "" Iran Cartoon "" association and the fair organizer , said ."
va	Ind	""" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison ,"" he added ."
va	Ind	""" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ?"""
va	Ind	Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran ' s Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
va	Ind	He added that around 1 , 100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
va	Ind	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Ind	This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
va	Ind	When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
va	Ind	When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
va	Ind	US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance .
va	Ind	The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
va	Ind	Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
va	Ind	Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
va	Ind	The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah .
va	Ind	Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
va	Ind	Allawi ' s aged cousin and the man ' s wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
va	Ind	In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
va	Ind	The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance .
va	Ind	If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
va	Ind	The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
va	Ind	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Ind	The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
va	Ind	Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .
va	Ind	[ Am at a conference and can ' t blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days .]
va	Ind	The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons .
va	Ind	Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
va	Ind	For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’ s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
va	Ind	At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
va	Ind	Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
va	Ind	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’ s ever seen .
va	Ind	President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
va	Ind	With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
va	Ind	Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
va	Ind	But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal .
va	Ind	The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
va	Ind	It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
va	Ind	North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
va	Ind	It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
va	Ind	But getting past who should get them , is who has them , and who is really close .
va	Ind	The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
va	Ind	Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq .
va	Ind	America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’ s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
va	Ind	I ran across this item on the Internet .
va	Ind	"The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U . S . citizens ( most of whom were "" dual - citizens "")."
va	Ind	Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U . S . citizen .
va	Ind	Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ).
va	Ind	In other words , those Americans were there by their own choice , mired in a situation that was totally predictable .
va	Ind	Yet we didn ' t charge them for the evacuation .
va	Ind	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U . S . citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
va	Ind	And what do we get for this effort ?
va	Ind	That ' s right , folks .
va	Ind	The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts .
va	Ind	Here ' s an excerpt from the article :
va	Ind	Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
va	Ind	The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
va	Ind	""" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home ,"" Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit ."
va	Ind	""" We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us ."
va	Ind	"I was on my way to my wedding fearing death , basically ."""
va	Ind	Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20 , 000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
va	Ind	Here ' s a tip : Don ' t get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter - attack !
va	Ind	Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making .
va	Ind	"Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin ' s "" White House Briefing "" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ):"
va	Ind	At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
va	Ind	This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn ' t anticipated .
va	Ind	""" Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there ' s a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President ."
va	Ind	After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
va	Ind	""" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that ."
va	Ind	There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I don ' t know .
va	Ind	I ' m just speculating now .
va	Ind	I really haven ' t thought about writing a book .
va	Ind	My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job .
va	Ind	But if -- there ' s a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
va	Ind	It ' s a Western scene by a guy named W . H . S . Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Ind	It ' s on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O ' Neill in Midland , Texas .
va	Ind	He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
va	Ind	Four months later , we were married .
va	Ind	So he ' s got a -- I ' m a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
va	Ind	""" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer ."
va	Ind	This is not a filibuster .
va	Ind	That ' s a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
va	Ind	The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor .
va	Ind	Laura and I are Methodists .
va	Ind	One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn .
va	Ind	The painting is based upon the hymn called , ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Ind	I have .
va	Ind	The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .
va	Ind	I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can .
va	Ind	""" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep ."
va	Ind	And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
va	Ind	Now that ' s a rambling response .
va	Ind	"And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "" A Charge to Keep ""?"
va	Ind	"That was the name of his "" autobiography "" -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 ."
va	Ind	There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and / or acquiring Firefox .
va	Ind	It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
va	Ind	They have acquired Urchin , Zipdash , Applied Semantics , Picasa , Blogger , and satellite imaging company Keyhole , so why not Firefox ?
va	Ind	I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
va	Ind	Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
va	Ind	He announced this in January :
va	Ind	As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc . of Mountain View , California .
va	Ind	My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1 . 1 , 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 releases .
va	Ind	I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
va	Ind	He also announced this in January :
va	Ind	"I just want to extend a big "" Welcome !"" to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week ."
va	Ind	2005 is going to rock !
va	Ind	Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25 , 2005 :
va	Ind	Following on the heels of Ben ' s annoucement yesterday , I thought I ' d post that I have joined Google as well .
va	Ind	Ben made another announcement on March 28 , 2005 :
va	Ind	I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
va	Ind	Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years ,...
va	Ind	Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it ' s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
va	Ind	In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
va	Ind	If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
va	Ind	In this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 .
va	Ind	This is one thought - provoking film .
va	Ind	Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer .
va	Ind	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Ind	They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
va	Ind	I ' m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non - Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they ' re ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
va	Ind	It ' s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
va	Ind	Malach , What you say makes sense .
va	Ind	Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go .
va	Ind	It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis - matches .
va	Ind	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr ' s movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
va	Ind	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
va	Ind	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
va	Ind	At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ?
va	Ind	One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
va	Ind	State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
va	Ind	The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up .
va	Ind	Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ).
va	Ind	They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick .
va	Ind	( Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess .)
va	Ind	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
va	Ind	The Washington Monthly ' s Who ' s Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
va	Ind	"Sept . 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept . 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "" protect Israel ,"" according to the Asian Times ."
va	Ind	I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
va	Ind	But they haven ' t been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
va	Ind	Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
va	Ind	This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at .
va	Ind	There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don ' t want to fall into it .
va	Ind	But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
va	Ind	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
va	Ind	"' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group ' s "" striking arm "" in Iraq ."
va	Ind	""" I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas ,"" Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah ."
va	Ind	Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas .
va	Ind	""" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same ,"" al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad ."
va	Ind	He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
va	Ind	And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
va	Ind	The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
va	Ind	I ' m not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
va	Ind	Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for .
va	Ind	Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday ?
va	Ind	i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out .
va	Ind	Bryan , you ' re in , right ?
va	Ind	I was thinking Kenneally ' s at around 5 .
va	Ind	you don ' t know what that means ?
va	Ind	where did you grow up ?
va	Ind	should I be embarrassed that I haven ' t the slightest idea what that means ?
va	Ind	i am going out tonight to get wasted if anyone is interested .
va	Ind	jill allen finishes her cpa today and she and her friends are going to party .
va	Ind	max and jen are looking for you .
va	Ind	they haven ' t heard from you in a while .
va	Ind	In fact Peder and I were remarking on how agreeable they all are as the sucked on our balls last night .
va	Ind	i have to go to butt - fucking mississippi .
va	Ind	i am not looking foward to that but don ' t tell val .
va	Ind	i think they are all bark and no bite .
va	Ind	i think they could get their asses kicked by cats .
va	Ind	they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk .
va	Ind	no , i am not kidding and no i don ' t want it b / c of the taco bell dog .
va	Ind	i want it b / c it is really small and cute .
va	Ind	i knew someone in college who had one and i loved it .
va	Ind	why do you think they are mean ?
va	Ind	are you kidding ?
va	Ind	those dogs aren ' t even friendly .
va	Ind	do you think they are cool b / c of the taco bell dog ?
va	Ind	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Ind	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Ind	In other words the table is set .
va	Ind	I . E . the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
va	Ind	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .

va	Ind	On or about September 23 , 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty .
va	Ind	The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement .

va	Ind	I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle .
va	Ind	"Not sure if I am going to buy 17 "" or 16 "" wheels for the winter ."
va	Ind	You have always been on the move seeking affectionate , satisfying and harmonious relationships .
va	Ind	Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love , self - sacrifice and mutual trust .
va	Ind	"It has often been said that "" True love is just around the corner ""... and maybe ... if you haven ' t found it as yet - you possibly soon will ."
va	Ind	In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without .
va	Ind	You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem .
va	Ind	You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment ..
va	Ind	Whatever you strive to do , something always seems to be holding you back .
va	Ind	There is no subterfuge in you .
va	Ind	You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life , in a relationship , is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can , together , develop a foundation of trust based on understanding .
va	Ind	You are your own person ... and you demand freedom of thought ... to follow your own convictions .
va	Ind	"You have no interest in "" two - timing "" and all you seek is sincerity and "" straight - dealing ""."
va	Ind	You wish to be left in peace ... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ...
va	Ind	In fact you just don ' t want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ...
va	Ind	"All you want is for "" them "" to get on with it - and to leave you alone .."
va	Ind	sorry for not sending it to you earlier ( totally forgot to open my outlook ).

va	Ind	I was on vacation from October 4th to October 19th and I didn ' t submit my timesheet yet .

va	Ind	Is it possible that you or somebody else in the HR department mark the vacation time ?
va	Ind	Thank you .
va	Ind	I have attached a revised copy of the GISB Agreement and Special Provisions for your review and consideration .
va	Ind	I anticipate completing the review of the Master Agreement form and submitting comments to you by Monday .
va	Ind	In addition , I received feedback from our Gas Desk that the access to the Gas segment of Enron On - Line was cut off to CPS --- do you know who would handle this at Enron that we can speak to ?
va	Ind	Greatly appreciate your prompt feedback to this inquiry .
va	Ind	I look forward to your feedback on the GISB .
va	Ind	PS - Were you having phone system problems this morning ?
va	Ind	Myself and Credit were calling in and none of the calls rolled into voice mail (?).
va	Ind	I have sent your question re on line trading to that area .
va	Ind	I am in the process of reviewing your special provisions .
va	Ind	Jackie Taylor - she is located at Court House Concessionaire and under her name in the directory .
va	Ind	The only agreement I can find is a Master Sale Spot w / City of Springfield .
va	Ind	Attached is an image of the GISB .
va	Ind	As you see it was CES acquired by ENA in asset purchase .
va	Ind	"I do not find the term "" Alternate Transporter Imbalance "" in our agreement .."
va	Ind	"The term "" Aggregate Transporter Imbalance "" is located in several sections ."
va	Ind	Could this be what your referencing ?
va	Ind	These look fine to me .
va	Ind	You are correct , I will make the appropriate changes and give you another review before sending execution papers .
va	Ind	As discussed , attached is a GISB draft for Pioneer .
va	Ind	As you can see there are several blanks concerning administrative information for ENA Upstream .
va	Ind	I was able to secure a Duns # and Fed Tax ID however , I am lacking Fax and bank account numbers .
va	Ind	Do you have this information ?
va	Ind	The Guaranty is dated August 1 , 2000 .
va	Ind	They are taking delivery in the U . S .
va	Ind	Can you send me the data you used : I shall take a look at it .
va	Ind	My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi .
va	Ind	"I used to e - mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article "" The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives "" and he had mailed me the copy ."
va	Ind	"I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper "" Making the most of mean reversion "" to estimate the mean reversion speed ."
va	Ind	I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 giving about 44 , 000 price observations .
va	Ind	However , the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept .
va	Ind	The coefficient and standard error are as followed :
va	Ind	Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign .
va	Ind	I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same .
va	Ind	This is the best solution given all the uncertainties we face .
va	Ind	Right now , we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year .
va	Ind	Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer .
va	Ind	What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo ' s resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer .
va	Ind	When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group .
va	Ind	Is this okay with you ?
va	Ind	Hope all is well with you
va	Ind	I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday .
va	Ind	One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship .
va	Ind	He came across as a very bright person , very personable .
va	Ind	How are you doing ?
va	Ind	I hope you have a good flight back to home .
va	Ind	It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector .
va	Ind	Thank you for your time .
va	Ind	I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk .
va	Ind	However , you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again .
va	Ind	Those attachments are what I was asked .
va	Ind	Again , it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school .
va	Ind	I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day .
va	Ind	Thank you .
va	Ind	Thank you ,
va	Ind	This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event .
va	Ind	The way the tax law works , the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent .
va	Ind	As you know , we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt .
va	Ind	As such , we have a CPA , Larry Lewis , working with us to audit and set up transition files .
va	Ind	He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments .
va	Ind	Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units .
va	Ind	It is clear that the payment will be made in shares .
va	Ind	However , I still don ' t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares .
va	Ind	"Amount of Benefit Payments reads "" The value of the shares , and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp . common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment , and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp . common stock ."""
va	Ind	Thank you ,
va	Ind	I am expecting to pay something in the $ 3 , to $ 5 , 000 range .
va	Ind	It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding .

va	Ind	I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office .
va	Ind	The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold .
va	Ind	I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices .
va	Ind	Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties ?
va	Ind	The Roma deal looks much better .
va	Ind	This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting .
va	Ind	Hope you enjoy the posts and feel free to jump in anywhere .
va	Ind	Hope to see you soon !
va	Ind	All you have to do is sign up for one free offer ( such as efax ) and then cancel within the offer time frame .

va	Ind	Frequent travelers and executives are among the masses that get a lot of discount in the airfare .
va	Ind	It is easy to get discount airfare for them since they travel very frequently .
va	Ind	Some of the corporate also get cheap air tickets because they tie up with some of the airlines for a certain period based on the discount and services they get from the airlines .
va	Ind	Corporate plans are clubbed with other services through some agencies to provide better service for their staff .
va	Ind	Some countries like Malaysia and Singapore promote trading for foreign visitors during some part of the year .

va	Ind	Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminated between ADHD , LD , and control subjects .
va	Ind	I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet .
va	Ind	The test itself is what is called a substitution test .
va	Ind	It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
va	Ind	I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it .

va	Ind	Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ), the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala .
va	Ind	In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth .
va	Ind	But within a few short months , the village people began to notice their wells were running dry , so they complained to the corporation .
va	Ind	Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams .
va	Ind	After several years of use , we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant ' s waste sludge and is laden with cadmium , a highly toxic , cancer - causing heavy metal .
va	Ind	The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life , so the plant was shut down last week .
va	Ind	Just kidding , Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown out of India for similar crimes , as well .
va	Ind	The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center ( GNOFHAC ) filed a housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans ( HANO ) last week .

Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St . Thomas , now known as River Garden .
va	Ind	The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St . Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement .
va	Ind	Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation , former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees .
va	Ind	Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .
va	Ind	""" In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever ."
va	Ind	"As such , it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement ,"" said James Perry , GNOFHAC Executive Director"
va	Ind	Crude - oil prices rose Wednesday as strengthening Hurricane Rita , now a Category 5 storm , threatened to disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico .
va	Ind	New York ' s main contract , light sweet crude for delivery in November rose 60 cents to close at 66 . 80 dollars per barrel .
va	Ind	In London , the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery advanced 53 cents to 64 . 73 dollars .
va	Ind	After brushing the Florida Keys islands on Tuesday , Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico .
va	Ind	"The US National Hurricane Center said Rita was "" extremely dangerous "" and could become a top - level category five storm on the Saffir - Simpson scale ."
va	Ind	The storm threatened oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico where about one - quarter of US oil operations are based .
va	Ind	Oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm ' s progress kept global markets on tenterhooks .
va	Ind	In Texas , BP shut its 460 , 000 barrels per day refinery and Marathon shut its 72 , 000 bpd plant .
va	Ind	Valero said it was reducing rates at its 243 , 000 bpd Texas City refinery and its 85 , 000 bpd Houston refinery .
va	Ind	Exxon Mobil released nonessential staff from two giant Texas plants .
va	Ind	Last month , Katrina devastated refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi and sent prices to a record high of 70 . 85 dollars a barrel .
va	Ind	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Ind	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Ind	NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
va	Ind	Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world .
va	Ind	On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
va	Ind	""" That kind of a financial incentive [...] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge ,"" Griffin said ."
va	Ind	""" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ], but I do not expect it ,"" Griffin added ."
va	Ind	Only time will reveal whether Griffin ' s expectations are either exceeded or confirmed .
va	Ind	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
va	Ind	Normally this author is semi - objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi . com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ).
va	Ind	One thing is certain for sure .
va	Ind	"If Abbas keeps up this "" macho talk "" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank ."
va	Ind	Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan . 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec . 25 , 2004 .
va	Ind	Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat ' s legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood .
va	Ind	It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
va	Ind	He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
va	Ind	Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel ' s partially completed West Bank barrier .
va	Ind	Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
va	Ind	"Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue "" very important and very dangerous ."""
va	Ind	Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
va	Ind	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
va	Ind	The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence .
va	Ind	Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory .
va	Ind	In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
va	Ind	"Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "" unrestricted "" strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight ."
va	Ind	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Ind	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Ind	Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil .
va	Ind	Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
va	Ind	""" We ' re not happy with Hamas ' s position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians ,"" commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official ."
va	Ind	""" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda ."""
va	Ind	""" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel ' s scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure ,"" Habib said ."
va	Ind	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."
va	Ind	"Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war ."""
va	Ind	"Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire , and hopes to turn the Gaza strip "" into a vast battlefield ."""
va	Ind	Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

va	Ind	If there is no male they are probably infertile !
va	Ind	If you do not they will start to rot !
va	Ind	If she has no male to fertilize the eggs , the eggs will aways be infertile .
va	Ind	if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs .
va	Ind	Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny !
va	Ind	If she continues !

va	Ind	I have not had good experience with travel agents .
va	Ind	They don ' t seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them .
va	Ind	The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for .
va	Ind	The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own , and more options than what they were selling .
va	Ind	So now I do not bother with them at all .
va	Ind	best is using an online travel agent

va	Ind	I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse , rat , hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold .
va	Ind	Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though .

va	Ind	That ' s what I call customer service !
va	Ind	It ' s fine for ...
va	Ind	It ' s fine for mass - market chocolate , but with companies like Scharffen Berger , TCHO , and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area , why ?

va	Ind	Like the sushi , don ' t like the pad thai .
va	Ind	Holly - the owner , knows exactly how to make you feel beautiful in clothes .
va	Ind	She ' s an A + and so are her clothes !
va	Ind	There are a couple decent people working there , but the rest are VERY dishonest , as well as rude , I have yet to hear the truth come out of their mouths .
va	Ind	The pizzas are huge and super delicious .
va	Ind	They ' re our favorite pizza place to order from ... and they ' re a local , family owned company !
va	Ind	How much better does it get ?!
va	Ind	I loved the atmosphere here and the food is good , however the tables are so close together that it feels very cramped .

va	Ind	They were very professional , neat and clean .
va	Ind	They came through on all of their promises and we had a very successful day .
va	Ind	Hancocks is one of four fabric stores in Fort Smith .
va	Ind	We have Hobby Lobby , Just for Fun Fabrics , Walmart , and Interior Mall just inside Barling .
va	Ind	They do have a good selection of fabric and notions .
va	Ind	It was ok , nice management , they let us check in early , but the place was old .
va	Ind	It was clean , but just a little dumpy .
va	Ind	I ' ll admit I wasn ' t expecting much from this place , but they really did do a good job .

va	Ind	I loved my stay here and if ever back in the area , I will be staying here again .

va	Ind	“ This store is great !!
va	Ind	I love walking in and not being hassled .
va	Ind	I was there when they did a free raffle in August and I won a hard drive !
va	Ind	The reason I go back is because the employees are sooooo nice .”
va	Ind	I came in to get a nice gift for my wife .
va	Ind	The one guy who was there , I ' m guessing was the owner , was probably the least helpful person I ' ve ever met .
va	Ind	But thankfully there are other flowers shops around Norman .
va	Ind	Destiny Allison ' s metal sculptures were my favorite .
va	Ind	The owner Karla is welcoming and fun .
va	Ind	This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch .
va	Ind	They offer a good portions at a great price , it ' s enough food to fill you up , but you don ' t ever feel like you ate too much .

va	Ind	Their selection is top notch and the staff is very knowledgable .
va	Ind	Chuck and Gretchen were very positive , and when Alan ' s refused to work on my bike , Chuck came right out and saw the problem and did what Alan ' s mechanic wouldn ' t do .
va	Ind	He worked on it right on the back of my car .
va	Ind	I am extremely pleased
va	Ind	Walked in and was outta there in 10 mins with a really good deal i thought i was going to be paying alot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and Sr - 22 they were able to get me the best deal out there .
va	Ind	Is not a service office
va	Ind	This is a delivery office only and does not take walk ins but they do have a blue box out front .
va	Ind	Glad I called before I arrived with my box to ship .
va	Ind	Thought adding a comment would save someone the hassle with a useless trip there .
va	Ind	the food is mediocre at best .
va	Ind	the waitress took my name and then called me that all night .
va	Ind	not sure how I feel about that one .
va	Ind	it ' s passable as a pub , but the pizza is not that great .
va	Ind	Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for this dentist ( a HUGE number compared to the others in the area ), but that they all have the same unique grammar structure ?
va	Ind	And they seem to be posted at fairly regular intervals ?
va	Ind	We go to Japaneiro ' s all the time and we have NEVER been disappointed !
va	Ind	Wait staff is always ready to help if you can ' t decide ( which happens every time for me d / t the huge menu of rolls ) and always courteous !

va	Ind	I have nothing but fantastic things to say .
va	Ind	I highly recommend his shop .
va	Ind	This shop is by far the best I have been to .
va	Ind	I have a Saab ... which everything is expensive on and they have been extrememly fair and price alot lower than any other shop I called .
va	Ind	They are the only place I would take my car peiod .
va	Ind	Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced .
va	Ind	Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in .
va	Ind	The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead .

va	Ind	We have stayed at Tanglewood for many years now .
va	Ind	We go over about 5 times a year .

va	Ind	Helen is a wonderful place to take you family .
va	Ind	We recommend these cabins !
va	Ind	I used to tan down the street before I was referred to this place by one of my friends .
va	Ind	I didn ' t know what I was missing .

va	Ind	"In a few words ... I ' m pleasantly surprised that you can still find "" old school "" service out there where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets ..."
va	Ind	If possible I try the services on myself before I bring in my son .
va	Ind	Drs . Ali work wonders .
va	Ind	Neither me nor my son haven ' t had a single cavity since we started dental care there .
va	Ind	The team focus is prevention and education .
va	Ind	That alone makes them unique .
va	Ind	This is not your usual cheap hotdog place .
va	Ind	They offer a large variety of quality hotdogs and hamburgers They also offer veggie dogs .
va	Ind	The fries are of good quality , the staff is friendly .
va	Ind	The atmosphere is your typical indie outfit with old movie posters and memorabilia from the 70 ' s and 80 ' s .
va	Ind	I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my receipt was $ 8 . 95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show $ 10 . 74 .
va	Ind	There is something wrong or maybe the individual made a mistake but to me that is not integrity .
va	Ind	Elmira , your the best !
va	Ind	All I can say is that Elmira you are the best Ive experienced , never before has the seamstress done a perfect job until i met you .
va	Ind	I recommend you to everyone in Calgary , as she is a professional and the cost for her was low .
va	Ind	I took my Mustang here and it looked amazing after they were done , they did a great job , I ' m very satisfied with the results .

te	Ind	What if Google Morphed Into GoogleOS ?
te	Ind	What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e - mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
te	Ind	( And , by the way , is anybody else just a little nostalgic for the days when that was a good thing ?)
te	Ind	This BuzzMachine post argues that Google ' s rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we ' ve all heard before , but it ' s particularly well - put in this post .
te	Ind	Google is a nice search engine .
te	Ind	Does anybody use it for anything else ?
te	Ind	They own blogger , of course .
te	Ind	Is that a money maker ?
te	Ind	I ' m staying away from the stock .
te	Ind	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Ind	John Donovan from Argghhh ! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah .
te	Ind	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Ind	One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah .
te	Ind	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Ind	You have to see these slides .... they are amazing .
te	Ind	I ' m not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument
te	Ind	( You don ' t need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you don ' t need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you ' re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ).
te	Ind	However , this toolbar is really bad news .
te	Ind	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Ind	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
te	Ind	The United States doesn ' t believe the Iranian Government .
te	Ind	But there is no proof .
te	Ind	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
te	Ind	They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti - proliferation treaty .
te	Ind	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn ' t even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
te	Ind	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
te	Ind	Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure .
te	Ind	One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage .
te	Ind	He has denied this .
te	Ind	We don ' t have to believe him .
te	Ind	It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof .
te	Ind	Angry crowds chanted anti - American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop . 256 , 000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday .
te	Ind	"Reuters reported that "" Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today ."""
te	Ind	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Ind	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders .
te	Ind	Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there , since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals .
te	Ind	Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country ' s wealth and power .
te	Ind	They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .
te	Ind	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v . Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D . C . Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
te	Ind	The actual vote is a little confusing .
te	Ind	BREYER filed a concurring opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG joined .
te	Ind	KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II .
te	Ind	SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO joined .
te	Ind	THOMAS filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA joined , and in which ALITO joined as to all but Parts I , II - C - 1 , and III - B - 2 .
te	Ind	ALITO filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III .
te	Ind	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
te	Ind	I ' ll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I ' m finished .
te	Ind	Important news such as President Bush ' s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti - gay ( update : he ' s not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
te	Ind	I had to go to the BBC for this report .
te	Ind	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Ind	It ' s just disappointing .
te	Ind	Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .
te	Ind	At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .
te	Ind	Two weeks later , and the violence continues .
te	Ind	The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15 , 000 , according to analysts .
te	Ind	And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .
te	Ind	So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .
te	Ind	Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
te	Ind	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Ind	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Ind	Which essentially sounds like he ' s worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
te	Ind	I assume his actual reason is that he ' s worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can ' t grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
te	Ind	I ' m not sure how the market will react .
te	Ind	It doesn ' t change the company ' s intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
te	Ind	On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
te	Ind	em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .
te	Ind	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).
te	Ind	He mentions his wife ' s death having an effect on him .
te	Ind	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Ind	Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :
te	Ind	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
te	Ind	To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria ' s promised withdrawal .
te	Ind	Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .
te	Ind	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."
te	Ind	This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .
te	Ind	"Over three years after 9 - 11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "" terrorist "" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts ."
te	Ind	The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
te	Ind	The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .
te	Ind	I ' ve been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .
te	Ind	Wtf is this ?
te	Ind	This is a terrorist organization plain and simple .
te	Ind	This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80 ' s and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?
te	Ind	This is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .
te	Ind	The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .
te	Ind	It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .
te	Ind	The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .
te	Ind	That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .
te	Ind	Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans .
te	Ind	"In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "" raiding forces "" in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins ."
te	Ind	"The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , "" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah ."
te	Ind	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .
te	Ind	"The statement said , "" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal ."""
te	Ind	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Ind	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .
te	Ind	Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti - Shiite pogroms .
te	Ind	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :
te	Ind	"U . S . Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "" war with Islamic fascists ,"" saying the term could inflame anti - Muslim tensions ."
te	Ind	U . S . officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .
te	Ind	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Ind	Which is why he didn ' t say we ' re at war with Islamic people .
te	Ind	We ' re at war with Islamic fascists .
te	Ind	"By using the word "" Islamic "" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier ."
te	Ind	And if you haven ' t heard by now , the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :
te	Ind	We ' ve got a Steven , the one word that didn ' t crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .
te	Ind	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Ind	But because we don ' t want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone ' s a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it ' s ever been .
te	Ind	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Ind	This pledge is a new development .
te	Ind	Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days .
te	Ind	One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .
te	Ind	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Ind	This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush ' s aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .
te	Ind	It is a setback for the war on terror .
te	Ind	"Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "" Afghan Arabs "" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden ."
te	Ind	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Ind	Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia ' s some 15 million citizens .
te	Ind	In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ).
te	Ind	After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .
te	Ind	Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .
te	Ind	They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .
te	Ind	They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .
te	Ind	( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ).
te	Ind	Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .
te	Ind	Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .
te	Ind	These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra .
te	Ind	So now there are hundreds of al - Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before .
te	Ind	The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al - Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings .
te	Ind	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Ind	Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush .
te	Ind	Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .
te	Ind	This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .
te	Ind	Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9 / 11 if he had known it was coming .
te	Ind	"The question is , "" Should he have known it was coming ?"""
te	Ind	"The answer is , "" Yes !"""
te	Ind	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
te	Ind	Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there , already in January or February of 2001 .
te	Ind	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Ind	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
te	Ind	Even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq .
te	Ind	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .
te	Ind	The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ).
te	Ind	"Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were "" no good targets "" in Afghanistan ."
te	Ind	( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9 / 11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ??)
te	Ind	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .
te	Ind	Bush did not have his eye on the ball .
te	Ind	Neither did Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz .
te	Ind	They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam ' s great white whale .
te	Ind	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Ind	They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to .
te	Ind	Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
te	Ind	"Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet ' s hair was "" on fire "" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists ."
te	Ind	Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .
te	Ind	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
te	Ind	You also need Pakistani air space .
te	Ind	The plan was all set and could have succeeded .
te	Ind	But in fall of 1999 , Gen . Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .
te	Ind	The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .
te	Ind	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn ' t use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
te	Ind	Clinton tried , and tried hard .
te	Ind	The gods weren ' t with us on that one .
te	Ind	"that is how i want you to refer to me as "" the king """
te	Ind	i don ' t think so .
te	Ind	i ' m the king
te	Ind	sounds exciting .

te	Ind	Thought that you might be interested .
te	Ind	Well , he launched today .
te	Ind	Have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today ?
te	Ind	I think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California ' s broken system --- a potential spoiler .
te	Ind	I ' m not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil .
te	Ind	I ' m not sure , but I think that he ' s got class tonite , too .

te	Ind	We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction , now that the forex desk has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market .
te	Ind	Further to my voicemail , our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve on the PSE swap .
te	Ind	They are currently using 9 . 5 % fixed based on the 1 year implied volatility .
te	Ind	Volatility of USD / DM has been in the range of between 7 % and 11 %.
te	Ind	In addition , is there someone who could consider the correlation between US CPI and the $/ euro exchange rate .
te	Ind	The credit guys are currently assuming that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the credit reserve on this basis too .
te	Ind	I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston .
te	Ind	I enjoyed your presentations very much .
te	Ind	I was wondering if you could give me some references regarding the calculation of correlation coefficients from a GARCH model .
te	Ind	Thank you .
te	Ind	I have settled the Ecogas / Enron / Randy Maffett lawsuit .
te	Ind	Seriously , I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $ 53 , 000 .
te	Ind	Hall has agreed to release Enron , Ecogas , Maffett and every affiliate , related party and subsidiary .
te	Ind	The goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well .
te	Ind	I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement .
te	Ind	Richard , below is a list of oc invoices sent to you for approval on 5 / 30 / 00 .
te	Ind	Thank you for your help in tracking these invoices .
te	Ind	I am on board .

te	Ind	Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well ?
te	Ind	We are renewing our L / C ' s on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders .
te	Ind	"However , the request below is to "" replenish "" the CASH that was drawn down ... please advise ."
te	Ind	I agree with Steve ' s position stated in his separate e ' mail .
te	Ind	Tracy , Do we have concerns here .
te	Ind	We pointed out to the PX that there was excess credit .
te	Ind	By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping required levels available ?
te	Ind	Attached below is Davis Thames ' presentation regarding the proposed Project Bruin .
te	Ind	I spoke with Mike Collins [ 203 - 719 - 8385 ( phone ) and 203 - 719 - 7031 ( fax )] who conrfirmed to me that the cap included the remaining 2 . 5 + million remaining shares .

te	Ind	"While Tanya is reviewing credit , can you please send a "" blank form Paragraph 13 "" for this master ."
te	Ind	Caveat : subject to credit review even though there are blanks .
te	Ind	I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft Credit Support Annex ( similar in form to the one previously executed with ENA ).
te	Ind	I understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime .
te	Ind	I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a general feel of your end of the process .
te	Ind	Pat had told me before he left that it would help me better grasp the process as a whole .
te	Ind	I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy , so now may not be the best time to be in your way .
te	Ind	I think it will help me very much in my role .

te	Ind	The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995 .
te	Ind	By September of that year the Dow had tumbled to 744 .
te	Ind	The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of ' 67 .
te	Ind	By March of ' 68 the Dow had fallen to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of ' 68 .
te	Ind	The Dow then sank to 631 in December of ' 70 .
te	Ind	By April of ' 71 the Dow had climbed back to 950 , only to fall to 869 in February of ' 72 .
te	Ind	A big rally then took the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of ' 73 , turning everyone bullish .
te	Ind	But by December of ' 73 the Dow had collapsed to 788 .
te	Ind	Think that was bad - by December of ' 74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 .
te	Ind	At that time , the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism .
te	Ind	Of course , that was the bottom
te	Ind	And that ' s the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down .
te	Ind	By late 1974 investors were dizzy , they were desperate , they were wrung - out , they had left Wall Street , many for good .
te	Ind	great , we look forward to seeing you .

te	Ind	I talked with Gary Wilson , and he confirmed that the revised values are correct .
te	Ind	Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values .
te	Ind	The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections .
te	Ind	The results of the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398 , 487MMBTU .
te	Ind	"In addition , there is a reduction of 22 , 101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA values ( Best Available ) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet and the "" official "" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS ."

te	Ind	"Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made in support of EPMI ' s obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement ("" PPA "") and Green Premium Sharing Agreement ("" GSPA "").?"
te	Ind	The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our Cabazon Wind Power Project ( the project most recently financed by EWC ) and the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty .
te	Ind	As we discussed last week , since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants , we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks .
te	Ind	We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller ' s obligations under the PPA .

te	Ind	U . S . astronauts will launch to the moon on sleek , single , shuttle booster rockets and the first new upper - stage rocket this country has developed in more than a decade , NASA and the Pentagon have told the White House .
te	Ind	It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved .
te	Ind	Although these new rockets are probably more expensive , they will be able to go at a much greater range than it ' s shuttle cousins , as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well .
te	Ind	""" NASA will initiate development of a Crew Launch Vehicle derived from space shuttle solid rocket boosters with a new upper stage for human spaceflight ,"" said the letter , signed by NASA Administrator Mike Griffin and the Pentagon ' s top space official , ex - astronaut Ron Sega ..."

te	Ind	The new NCL Epic does sound amazing , although I haven ' t sailed on her yet .

te	Ind	NCL is a notch below either , in terms of quality and service .

te	Ind	They chased the Communists out of the capital ( Hanoi ) and retook control .

te	Ind	Depends of what .
te	Ind	Ounces measure weight , pints measure volume .

te	Ind	"I doubt you will get a sensible answer in the "" TRAVEL "" section ."
te	Ind	And there ' s nothing distinctly Irish about them .
te	Ind	You ' d find similar bands to them that are from the UK and US .

te	Ind	I have a Kodak Camera ( 10 . 2 Megapixels )... Kodak AF 5x OPTICAL LENS ... how do I pause it while recording ?
te	Ind	"You don ' t ... there ' s no such thing as "" pause "" in digital recording ."
te	Ind	That ' s because of the buffer that holds the data until it ' s ready to be recorded to the memory card .
te	Ind	When you press the button to stop recording the data is moved from the buffer to the memory card - no pause .
te	Ind	All you can do is take each section ( individual video ) and edit them together on software .

te	Ind	Okay , FIRST , you have posted a question about an American movie , set in Mexico , in the Dining Out in Argentina category .
te	Ind	Do you get what ' s wrong with this picture ?
te	Ind	No ... that ' s all .
te	Ind	Nacho Libre is suppose to be inspired in Mexicans , not in Argentineans .

te	Ind	esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY !!!

te	Ind	Because he liked making statues of David ! : D
te	Ind	I have a friend out in Chicago this week , and I am trying to remember the name of an awesome hibachi style restaurant i visited while out there a couple years ago .
te	Ind	I think it was in the Lincoln Square area but don ' t quote me on that .
te	Ind	It ' s ' gimmick ' was that you fill your bowl cafeteria - style from raw ingredients and leave it on the counter with a chopstick listing your table number on it .
te	Ind	Four guys around a large square open hibachi cook your food , and when it ' s finished a server brings it to your table .
te	Ind	It was pretty epic as I remember and would love to send my friend there .
te	Ind	That is Flat Top Grill

te	Ind	I shoot a t1i and haven ' t had such an issue .
te	Ind	I also agree it ' s under warranty so get in touch with Canon .
te	Ind	It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re - boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re - start from time to time but it shouldn ' t be happening in a camera .
te	Ind	I ' m going on a vacation to the Philippines in May 2012 , and I ' m starting from Raleigh , NC ( RDU Airport ).

te	Ind	I just moved into the city , and I ' m wondering if there ' s a place I can get good deals on restaurants here .
te	Ind	I don ' t want to have to deal with those deal - a - day websites like Groupon .
