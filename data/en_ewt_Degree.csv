tr	Pos	Al - Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border .
tr	Pos	[ This killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come .]
tr	Pos	DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad .
tr	Pos	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J . Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s .
tr	Pos	The third was being run by the head of an investment firm .
tr	Pos	Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don ' t find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful .
tr	Pos	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Pos	Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul .
tr	Pos	The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings .
tr	Pos	On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home .
tr	Pos	( Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population , who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in .
tr	Pos	This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center - north of the country .)
tr	Pos	In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district .
tr	Pos	Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half .
tr	Pos	Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers .
tr	Pos	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Pos	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Pos	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Pos	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Pos	This item is a small one and easily missed .
tr	Pos	But in my view it is highly significant .
tr	Pos	The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas .
tr	Pos	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Pos	Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership .
tr	Pos	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Pos	Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
tr	Pos	In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya .
tr	Pos	My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non - stop .
tr	Pos	Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
tr	Pos	Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars , they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area , then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK - 47 ' s in the air .
tr	Pos	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year , which indicates they are the same people .
tr	Pos	Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood , and those are trained and armed , so don ' t expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn ' t bomb them , and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen ?
tr	Pos	Everyone is apprehensive , there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days .
tr	Pos	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Pos	Mosques are calling for donating blood , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah , most of them returned later though .
tr	Pos	What irritates me is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi ' ite clerics , we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance , and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as ' Ba ' athists ', ' Saddamites ', ' Wahhabis ', and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago .
tr	Pos	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Pos	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al - Sahhaf .
tr	Pos	""" They are targetting ambulances "", "" American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women "", and "" They are using cluster bombs against civilians "" is all you get to hear from him ."
tr	Pos	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Pos	Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents .
tr	Pos	Over 300 Iraqis are reported dead and 500 wounded in Fallujah alone .
tr	Pos	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Pos	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Pos	Elena ' s motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
tr	Pos	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Pos	Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story .
tr	Pos	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
tr	Pos	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
tr	Pos	Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
tr	Pos	In the last decade , there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise .
tr	Pos	The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .
tr	Pos	The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
tr	Pos	... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in women ' s reproductive health , an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ....
tr	Pos	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post - accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
tr	Pos	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Pos	Being well - informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
tr	Pos	Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions .
tr	Pos	These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl :
tr	Pos	I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing .
tr	Pos	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Pos	Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray ?
tr	Pos	The Chernobyl Children ' s Project ( http :// www . adiccp . org / home / default . asp ) offers several ways to help the children of that region .
tr	Pos	One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
tr	Pos	Even a little time spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc . can add years to their lives .
tr	Pos	S . and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
tr	Pos	The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming , and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have .
tr	Pos	I ' m sorry to say Elena ' s story has been revealed to be a fake .
tr	Pos	What do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
tr	Pos	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
tr	Pos	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Pos	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Pos	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Pos	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .
tr	Pos	MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelters Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .
tr	Pos	If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts .
tr	Pos	They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .
tr	Pos	All this is highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot schemes .
tr	Pos	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Pos	Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .
tr	Pos	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Pos	On the other , restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People ' s Party , who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police .
tr	Pos	On the other hand , the US should strong - arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue .
tr	Pos	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Pos	This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks .
tr	Pos	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Pos	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Pos	Israel owes the United States at least this much , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace .
tr	Pos	3 ) Make Iraq another Afghanistan , using the Republican Right ' s own tactics against them .
tr	Pos	Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there .
tr	Pos	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .
tr	Pos	The Americans have to put away their free - market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households .
tr	Pos	Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn ' t nearly as good a rallying cry for al - Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out .
tr	Pos	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Pos	George W . Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .
tr	Pos	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Pos	Let ' s just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :
tr	Pos	' Bush fails reporter ' s pop quiz on international leaders
tr	Pos	"Texas Gov . George W . Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those names ."
tr	Pos	The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
tr	Pos	"Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as "" Lee ."""
tr	Pos	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Pos	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Pos	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Pos	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Pos	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Pos	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Pos	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Pos	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Pos	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Pos	I can ' t tell you how ominous I found Bush ' s performance in that interview .
tr	Pos	"I still remember him stuttering about "" the General ,"" unable to remember Musharraf ' s name ."
tr	Pos	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Pos	"He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with "" stability ."""
tr	Pos	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Pos	He couldn ' t tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
tr	Pos	Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year .
tr	Pos	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Pos	Indeed , given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US , one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does .
tr	Pos	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Pos	"Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the U . S . has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians ."""
tr	Pos	From Friday ' s Daily Star
tr	Pos	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti - American terrorism .
tr	Pos	Have they , however , actually weakened Israeli security ?
tr	Pos	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings .
tr	Pos	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Pos	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
tr	Pos	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Pos	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel ' s security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Pos	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Pos	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
tr	Pos	Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians .
tr	Pos	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Pos	He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
tr	Pos	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Pos	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Pos	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Pos	The bungling of post - war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state .
tr	Pos	Armed militias , many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience , have proliferated .
tr	Pos	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
tr	Pos	Anti - Israeli and pro - Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents .
tr	Pos	The more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran ' s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
tr	Pos	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
tr	Pos	These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein ' s regime , but have now organized and armed themselves .
tr	Pos	They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
tr	Pos	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Pos	Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine .
tr	Pos	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , which is popular in Jordan .
tr	Pos	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post - Saddam Iraq are no exception .
tr	Pos	Whereas Saddam Hussein ' s dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , they are now free to organize .
tr	Pos	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .
tr	Pos	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country ' s petroleum reserves .
tr	Pos	That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites .
tr	Pos	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Pos	The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world , including Iraq .
tr	Pos	The promotion by the pro - Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened , not strengthened , Israeli security .

tr	Pos	Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
tr	Pos	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Pos	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Pos	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Pos	India defensive over Sri Lanka
tr	Pos	NEW DELHI -
tr	Pos	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Pos	And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s four - day visit to India recently .
tr	Pos	According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
tr	Pos	For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga ' s government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
tr	Pos	""" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one ."
tr	Pos	But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .
tr	Pos	Kumaratunga ' s India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .
tr	Pos	Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .
tr	Pos	Colombo , too , seems to be in an intractable position .
tr	Pos	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Pos	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Pos	Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .
tr	Pos	""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement ,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview ."
tr	Pos	In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .
tr	Pos	Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .
tr	Pos	However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .
tr	Pos	About 1 , 200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .
tr	Pos	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Pos	Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US $ 4 . 5 billion .
tr	Pos	Japan ' s special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
tr	Pos	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Pos	"The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces ."""
tr	Pos	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Pos	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Pos	""" Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process ,"" TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement ."
tr	Pos	"She added that recent visits to the island by India ' s top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island ""."
tr	Pos	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Pos	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Pos	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""
tr	Pos	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Pos	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Pos	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Pos	While most U . S . secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with , few have been as brazen as Colin Powell .
tr	Pos	Two years ago , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements .
tr	Pos	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Pos	That distinction has now gone to the United States .
tr	Pos	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Pos	Simultaneously , New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan .
tr	Pos	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Pos	With luck , the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist , education and services haven within India .
tr	Pos	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U . S . State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .
tr	Pos	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Pos	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Pos	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Pos	"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
tr	Pos	Despite Sept . 11 , the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy .
tr	Pos	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Pos	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Pos	"That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "" foreigner - led "" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism , has not struck the conferees , among whom have been several Indian "" scholars "" and "" analysts "" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna ."
tr	Pos	Despite many wrinkles , India remains a part - democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op - ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly .
tr	Pos	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Pos	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
tr	Pos	Since then , India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well .
tr	Pos	Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell ' s bluff , challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands .
tr	Pos	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Pos	"Under President Hu Jintao , Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year , making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U . N . Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "" permanent five "" that has not yet done so ."
tr	Pos	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Pos	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Pos	As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
tr	Pos	And , let ' s remember , flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous !
tr	Pos	Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush ' s service in the Texas Air National Guard .
tr	Pos	Bush ’ s National Guard years
tr	Pos	What do you really know about George W . Bush ’ s time in the Air National Guard ?
tr	Pos	News coverage of the president ’ s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
tr	Pos	So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :
tr	Pos	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
tr	Pos	Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
tr	Pos	Six weeks of basic training .
tr	Pos	That was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training periods thrown in as well .
tr	Pos	It was full - time work .
tr	Pos	As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
tr	Pos	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Pos	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Pos	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Pos	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti - Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ).
tr	Pos	His superior officers said OK .
tr	Pos	Requests like that weren ’ t unusual , says retired Col . William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
tr	Pos	“ In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots ,” Campenni says .
tr	Pos	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Pos	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Pos	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Pos	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Pos	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Pos	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Pos	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Pos	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Pos	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer .”
tr	Pos	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Pos	Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry ’ s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
tr	Pos	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Pos	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it ’ s important or not in November .
tr	Pos	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Pos	That ’ s fine .
tr	Pos	We should know as much as we can .
tr	Pos	Byron York is a White House correspondent for National Review .
tr	Pos	One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
tr	Pos	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Pos	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5 , 000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
tr	Pos	Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas .
tr	Pos	Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi ' s Al - Iraqiya list .
tr	Pos	Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
tr	Pos	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' gifts ' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi , a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis .
tr	Pos	Sheikh Naji Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list .
tr	Pos	Indeed , Sistani ' s agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
tr	Pos	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Pos	Again there is no official written statement from Sistani ' s office confirming this allegation , which I think is intentional .
tr	Pos	Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha ' lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
tr	Pos	"Chalabi describing Sha ' lan as a "" Ba ' athist "" and a "" former double agent for Saddam and the CIA "", while Sha ' lan dismisses Chalabi as a "" thief "" and an "" Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran ""."
tr	Pos	It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha ' lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
tr	Pos	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Pos	The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
tr	Pos	Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
tr	Pos	Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
tr	Pos	The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
tr	Pos	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
tr	Pos	I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
tr	Pos	After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can ' t mention here .
tr	Pos	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Pos	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Pos	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Pos	Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation .
tr	Pos	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
tr	Pos	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Pos	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Pos	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Pos	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Pos	But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I don ' t believe the US is going anywhere so soon .
tr	Pos	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Pos	The only hope now is that , following the elections , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties .
tr	Pos	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba ' athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
tr	Pos	Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
tr	Pos	Very recently , US forces in Al - Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul - Razaq Inad Al - Gu ' ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe .
tr	Pos	Al - Gu ' ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government .
tr	Pos	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
tr	Pos	Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
tr	Pos	I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
tr	Pos	Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
tr	Pos	Even partition is not a possibility , there are no clear borders between the two .
tr	Pos	Here ' s a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , published yesterday .
tr	Pos	Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials .
tr	Pos	Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada ' s whereabouts with an indefinite shrug .
tr	Pos	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Pos	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Pos	And though he ' d been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
tr	Pos	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
tr	Pos	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Pos	"Meiring ' s crimes are fresh , and wave the false flag which is the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Pos	They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
tr	Pos	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Pos	Posada ' s crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who don ' t know their history .
tr	Pos	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Pos	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Pos	The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post - Chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
tr	Pos	But Posada ' s nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that ' s a vain hope .
tr	Pos	So instead Posada may be held indefinitely , in comfortable custody .
tr	Pos	An embarrassment to the US still , just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami , gloating in his freedom .
tr	Pos	So his name will remain unspoken .
tr	Pos	Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
tr	Pos	Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
tr	Pos	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
tr	Pos	... same ole , same ole ...
tr	Pos	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
tr	Pos	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Pos	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Pos	"Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records "" for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P . Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA ."""
tr	Pos	Last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , threw out Wilson ' s two - decades old conviction .
tr	Pos	Judge Hughes wrote : ` government knowingly used false evidence against him ,' concluding ` honesty comes hard to government .'
tr	Pos	Former Pastor , Deputy Implicated In Church Child Sex Abuse
tr	Pos	Sheriff ' s deputies in Louisiana made a third arrest Wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of children and animals at a Ponchatoula , La ., church .
tr	Pos	Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church .
tr	Pos	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .
tr	Pos	We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose .
tr	Pos	Yesterday evening , the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany ( ARD , Tagesthemen ).

tr	Pos	+ As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Pos	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Pos	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
tr	Pos	In early February , India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ).
tr	Pos	These alleged members of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have been charged with illegal entry .
tr	Pos	It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar .
tr	Pos	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Pos	Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels .
tr	Pos	It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea .
tr	Pos	Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , which took a heavy toll on the Andamans .
tr	Pos	"Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy ' s Far Eastern Naval Command , now being established along with India ' s "" blue water navy ""."
tr	Pos	Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
tr	Pos	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Pos	The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base .
tr	Pos	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Pos	This is not unknown to New Delhi .
tr	Pos	A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands , using fake Indian ration cards , while citizens of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave .
tr	Pos	""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell ' s Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners ,"" he said ."
tr	Pos	"An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50 , 000 "" foreigners "" in the Andaman Islands , but unofficial figures are much higher than this ."
tr	Pos	A large number of them are Bangladeshis , who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere .
tr	Pos	The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns , cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous .
tr	Pos	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Pos	"One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying , "" Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region ."""
tr	Pos	Considering the islands ' huge strategic importance , it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been .
tr	Pos	These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily , bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia .
tr	Pos	As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Pos	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Pos	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
tr	Pos	With growing economic and military power , India will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security .
tr	Pos	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Pos	In fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti - India outfits , such as the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these networks and weaken India ' s eastern flank .
tr	Pos	Indian intelligence ' s lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling .
tr	Pos	This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid - 1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time .
tr	Pos	In 2001 , according to Indian army officials , security forces launched a wide - ranging operation in the 300 - some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar , and found huge caches of arms .
tr	Pos	"The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "" other terrorist groups ""."
tr	Pos	The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo .
tr	Pos	In addition , LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers .
tr	Pos	A shipment of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars , left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex - Joux 3 .
tr	Pos	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Pos	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Pos	In 1997 , the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition .
tr	Pos	Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People ' s Front .
tr	Pos	Subsequently , Phuket became the LTTE ' s main backup base .
tr	Pos	A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
tr	Pos	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Pos	Steady buildup
tr	Pos	The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building - up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less - strong militant groups .
tr	Pos	Over the past decade , Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness .
tr	Pos	A number of extremist groups , under the cover of the Islamist movement , have become active in drug trafficking , gun running and anti - Indian activities .
tr	Pos	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Pos	As a result , north of the Andaman Islands , Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms .
tr	Pos	The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox ' s Bazar passes through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong .
tr	Pos	Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non - Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island .
tr	Pos	Ramtanu Maitra writes for a number of international journals and is a regular contributor to the Washington - based EIR and the New Delhi - based Indian Defense Review .
tr	Pos	He also writes for Aakrosh , India ' s defense - tied quarterly journal .
tr	Pos	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Pos	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Pos	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Pos	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate . ]
tr	Pos	Karzai , Musharraf new regional equations
tr	Pos	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Pos	“ The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all .
tr	Pos	All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process , but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan .
tr	Pos	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Pos	That changed on September 22 when President George W . Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
tr	Pos	The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non - interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban .
tr	Pos	Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting , said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully .
tr	Pos	Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf .
tr	Pos	( Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban , Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb - e - Islami .)
tr	Pos	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Pos	‘’ Bush was very well briefed before the meeting ,’’ the diplomat said .
tr	Pos	An Afghan official at the meeting added , ‘’ The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda .’’
tr	Pos	Karzai was clearly pleased at the results .
tr	Pos	‘’ President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban ,’’ says Karzai .
tr	Pos	The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans .
tr	Pos	Until then he had said Pakistan ’ s options were open .
tr	Pos	However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
tr	Pos	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Pos	However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
tr	Pos	‘’ Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before ,’’ says Lt . General David Barno .
tr	Pos	Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
tr	Pos	However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .
tr	Pos	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Pos	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Pos	Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .
tr	Pos	US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .
tr	Pos	Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders , who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency .
tr	Pos	With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections , the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .
tr	Pos	With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home .
tr	Pos	Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .
tr	Pos	Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt . General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
tr	Pos	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Pos	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Pos	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Pos	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Pos	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate .
tr	Pos	Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
tr	Pos	Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also .
tr	Pos	In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai , Iran , Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai .
tr	Pos	Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .
tr	Pos	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Pos	However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same .
tr	Pos	With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’ s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced .
tr	Pos	However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates .
tr	Pos	Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran ’ s border .
tr	Pos	The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners .
tr	Pos	Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan ’ s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai ’ s campaign against warlords .
tr	Pos	At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’ s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo - conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively , the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran .
tr	Pos	Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand .
tr	Pos	‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters ,’’ says Barno .
tr	Pos	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .
tr	Pos	So far what they have done together has been good for us and that ’ s how we would like to keep it ’’, says Karzai .
tr	Pos	Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan ’ s neighbours is over , but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours ’ interference .
tr	Pos	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Pos	In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections , they would be resisted .
tr	Pos	Many Taliban living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai .
tr	Pos	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Pos	The debate that a handful of Texas multi - millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry ' s war record is absurd in every way .
tr	Pos	The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
tr	Pos	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Pos	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Pos	If some of John Kerry ' s wounds were superficial , Bush received no wounds .
tr	Pos	( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn ' t absent yourself from it .
tr	Pos	Bush did no such thing .
tr	Pos	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Pos	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Pos	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Pos	Bush has a sadistic streak .
tr	Pos	His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
tr	Pos	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Pos	Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy .
tr	Pos	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Pos	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Pos	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Pos	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Pos	Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
tr	Pos	But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
tr	Pos	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Pos	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Pos	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Pos	"There is one place in Alabama where Mr . Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Pos	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Pos	In 1972 , Baba Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign .
tr	Pos	Groom was Republican Red Blount ' s scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
tr	Pos	Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas , and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday .
tr	Pos	Ms . BABA GROOM ( Former Campaign Worker ):
tr	Pos	He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
tr	Pos	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Pos	GOODWYN : The candidate Mr . Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business .
tr	Pos	Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days .
tr	Pos	That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father ' s urging . . .
tr	Pos	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Pos	Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural counties didn ' t have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
tr	Pos	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Pos	Groom says this job helped Mr . Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics are local .
tr	Pos	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Pos	Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr . Bush was not one of them .
tr	Pos	Mr . MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ): Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid - evenings .
tr	Pos	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Pos	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Pos	After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr . Bush about it .
tr	Pos	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Pos	GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr . Bush enjoyed his freedom .
tr	Pos	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Pos	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Pos	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Pos	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Pos	Mr . ARCHIBALD : People have different ways of starting the days in any office .
tr	Pos	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Pos	GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr . Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
tr	Pos	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Pos	I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
tr	Pos	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Pos	Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- didn ' t like that story .
tr	Pos	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Pos	Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn ' t remember George telling drunk stories .
tr	Pos	Again , decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
tr	Pos	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
tr	Pos	Afraid I don ' t have time today to discuss these , but some stories need attention :
tr	Pos	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Pos	But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
tr	Pos	And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered .
tr	Pos	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Pos	"Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : "" It ' s unbelievable that no one can account for 200 , 000 assault rifles ."
tr	Pos	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Pos	American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq .
tr	Pos	"A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "" any weapons from Bosnia "" and added they were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia ""."
tr	Pos	Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US , British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents .
tr	Pos	"A NATO spokesman said : "" There ' s no tracking mechanism to ensure they don ' t fall into the wrong hands ."
tr	Pos	This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re - routed to al - Qaeda .
tr	Pos	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Pos	"But then , even to talk of an "" administration "" may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative government means in the United States these days , and how much of "" national security "" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns ."
tr	Pos	"Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "" lost "" in Iraq , planeloads of arms don ' t just "" vanish ""; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout ' s untouchable stature ."
tr	Pos	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Pos	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Pos	The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
tr	Pos	Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .
tr	Pos	An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
tr	Pos	"After the sentencing one of Robinson ' s tearful supporters "" turned to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [ SNAP ], who had helped reopen the case , and told her , ' I hope you rot in hell !'"""
tr	Pos	When victims and witnesses stay silent , nothing changes .
tr	Pos	Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ... the man who reopened the investigations last year , is mysteriously stepping down .
tr	Pos	And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation .
tr	Pos	SNAP is right in part .
tr	Pos	lots of important stories out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good souls for that conviction .
tr	Pos	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
tr	Pos	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Pos	"Specifically , Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "" spiritual "" marriages for girls and older men ."
tr	Pos	"At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state officials said Jeffs "" is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards ."""
tr	Pos	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Pos	As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo - Nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs has preached racism as well .
tr	Pos	""" The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth ,"" Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center ' s "" Intelligence Report ."""
tr	Pos	I ' m sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
tr	Pos	just go here , its simply amazing
tr	Pos	The Raw Story
tr	Pos	i count like 14 explosive headlines .
tr	Pos	Funny how some things are squirelled away by well - meaning prosecutors ...
tr	Pos	I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
tr	Pos	Personally I don ' t give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
tr	Pos	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
tr	Pos	Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life .
tr	Pos	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
tr	Pos	Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time .
tr	Pos	a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
tr	Pos	It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child .
tr	Pos	The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure .
tr	Pos	One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father ' s own brother .
tr	Pos	It ' s a good thing too .
tr	Pos	Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate .
tr	Pos	What ' s a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash ?
tr	Pos	Just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy , huh ?
tr	Pos	Christ , you ' d think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots .
tr	Pos	I suppose that it ' s damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots .
tr	Pos	US outsourcing special ops , intelligence to Iraq terror group , intelligence officials say
tr	Pos	The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ...
tr	Pos	And MEK -- the Iranian ( not Iraqi ) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult :
tr	Pos	When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
tr	Pos	When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
tr	Pos	Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
tr	Pos	'' Every morning and night , the kids , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute them and shout praises to them ,'' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told me .
tr	Pos	Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
tr	Pos	Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France .
tr	Pos	The Rajavis , Afshari went on to say , '' saw these kids as the next generation ' s soldiers .
tr	Pos	One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don ' t know what they are , don ' t care , or know perfectly well .
tr	Pos	Jimmy Plant , Blogshares is a fantasy blogosphere trading game with pretend money .
tr	Pos	Bush successfully makes Satan look good in comparison .
tr	Pos	""" Another generation of heavy metal has taken over , and -- sorry -- it ain ' t just about strippers and dope ."
tr	Pos	It ' s become a guardian of morality -- not church morality ; real morality .
tr	Pos	"Praise be : Given the void in responsible behavior among governments , police , educational establishments and religions , the task of guiding our youth down the path of righteousness has fallen to ... Satan """
tr	Pos	The people who carry out these underground arms / drugs / sex trafficking deals are trauma based mind controlled slaves .
tr	Pos	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Pos	"And were the Columbine killers acting out this "" real morality "" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates ."
tr	Pos	( not church morality , no that is phoney , love thy neighbor ... hell no , kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????)
tr	Pos	The deathly inversion of truth , ala satanism .
tr	Pos	The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .
tr	Pos	Irony is dead ... Long live Irony !
tr	Pos	Well , it ' s not as simple and clear cut as all that .
tr	Pos	We ' re entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio - political - spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection .
tr	Pos	The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion .
tr	Pos	Imaginary evil is romantic and varied ; real evil is gloomy , monotonous , barren , boring .
tr	Pos	Imaginary good is boring ; real good is always new , marvelous , intoxicating .
tr	Pos	I wouldn ' t wonder too hard .
tr	Pos	The answer is likely D : all of the above , due to this being a complex reality we live in .
tr	Pos	But to me , without question , they often know perfectly well .
tr	Pos	Here is a thought : When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Pos	& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old .
tr	Pos	"Since the article was specifically about "" death metal "" I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality :"
tr	Pos	One man ' s relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post - war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year .
tr	Pos	They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home .
tr	Pos	The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together .
tr	Pos	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Pos	No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
tr	Pos	It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
tr	Pos	During this search , Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son ' s disappearance .
tr	Pos	""" No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked ."
tr	Pos	"They ' re inseparable ,"" he says ."
tr	Pos	"Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : "" To hell with death ""."
tr	Pos	The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
tr	Pos	Do you really think GWB , and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth ?
tr	Pos	( I know , ignorant question ) Then why call them , or any other phonies ' Christians ', even if they themselves claim the appellation .
tr	Pos	We need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
tr	Pos	... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Pos	Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
tr	Pos	Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of ' degenerate art ' in 1937 , while curating a parallel show of ' Aryan ' art across the street .
tr	Pos	The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result .
tr	Pos	Here ' s a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst ( Degenerate Art ) exhibit of 1937 :
tr	Pos	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Pos	Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .
tr	Pos	When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Pos	Are the adherent of ' Crowleyan Thelema ' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect ' energy ?'
tr	Pos	Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place ?
tr	Pos	Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the ' imaginary ' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon , which is this global system .
tr	Pos	Is the distinction accurate and valid ?
tr	Pos	This is where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum comes into play .
tr	Pos	Confused ?
tr	Pos	My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
tr	Pos	Here ' s another interesting example :
tr	Pos	He blended belief systems such as Shamanism , Christianity , Buddhism , Paganism , Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil ' s vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners .

tr	Pos	I went across the bay last night to attend a farmer ' s market and music event .
tr	Pos	Two young men delivering information about the Mormon genealogy program .
tr	Pos	Kindly young men , but utterly programmed and brain - dead .
tr	Pos	It would have been too painful to watch .
tr	Pos	But succintly making point after succint point , the text of the letter stands on its own merit , regardless .
tr	Pos	I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W ' s head if he were to actually read the letter , but it is hard to picture him actually reading this letter .
tr	Pos	"As I read the letter , I considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it , vs . that of the mind of the man who once said "" Bring it on !"""

tr	Pos	Important Kos Diary about bush ' s response to the gathering storm of scandals :
tr	Pos	= Executive Orders -
tr	Pos	very creepy , very scary
tr	Pos	== Why did Bush revoke Executive Order 13011 today ?
tr	Pos	In scanning the whitehouse . gov site today , I noticed the following Executive Order :
tr	Pos	Executive Order : Amendments to Executive Orders 11030 , 13279 , 13339 , 13381 , and 13389 , and *** Revocation *** of Executive Order 13011 ....
tr	Pos	I can ' t believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI .
tr	Pos	I ' m wary of jumping into this fray without backup , that ' s for damn sure . :)
tr	Pos	I ' m a regular poster but for some reason blogger won ' t let me in today ... but sign me TroubleFunk .
tr	Pos	Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
tr	Pos	For example , is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?
tr	Pos	Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
tr	Pos	Similarly , is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system ?
tr	Pos	The ' high weirdness ' and more hardcore political ' factions ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
tr	Pos	In regards to death metal , the problem is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture .
tr	Pos	Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well ?
tr	Pos	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
tr	Pos	My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion .
tr	Pos	True believers are dangerous animals .
tr	Pos	I just get hung up on ' Christians ', as they ' re the dominant form where I come from .
tr	Pos	Also , I ' m quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses .
tr	Pos	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush ' s claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
tr	Pos	I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
tr	Pos	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
tr	Pos	Again , I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly .
tr	Pos	These people are dangerous wether they ' re head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers '.
tr	Pos	( The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic ....)
tr	Pos	I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non - violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it ' s important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
tr	Pos	The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns , and then 200 , 000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus .
tr	Pos	I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US ' s local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
tr	Pos	It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi - nation corporation .

tr	Pos	""" As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological "" entertainment "" in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come ."
tr	Pos	I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
tr	Pos	You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
tr	Pos	I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
tr	Pos	I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non - Arab and also significant non - Moslem minorities .
tr	Pos	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
tr	Pos	Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
tr	Pos	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Pos	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Pos	The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Pos	Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
tr	Pos	Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60 ' s because of Israel .
tr	Pos	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Pos	The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Pos	The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
tr	Pos	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
tr	Pos	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Pos	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Pos	Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
tr	Pos	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Pos	Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
tr	Pos	Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
tr	Pos	And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
tr	Pos	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Pos	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Pos	A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
tr	Pos	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Pos	They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
tr	Pos	Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
tr	Pos	The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
tr	Pos	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Pos	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Pos	* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder .*
tr	Pos	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
tr	Pos	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Pos	Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
tr	Pos	September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
tr	Pos	It is spectacular .
tr	Pos	It is frightening .
tr	Pos	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Pos	It is always shown on television in great detail .
tr	Pos	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Pos	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
tr	Pos	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
tr	Pos	The U . S . and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
tr	Pos	But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
tr	Pos	Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
tr	Pos	How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
tr	Pos	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
tr	Pos	Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
tr	Pos	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
tr	Pos	No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
tr	Pos	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
tr	Pos	No relative of anyone influential has done it .
tr	Pos	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Pos	Aren ' t they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
tr	Pos	Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
tr	Pos	They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
tr	Pos	There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
tr	Pos	A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
tr	Pos	"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
tr	Pos	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Pos	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
tr	Pos	If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
tr	Pos	The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
tr	Pos	Turkey understands it well .
tr	Pos	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
tr	Pos	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Pos	In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
tr	Pos	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
tr	Pos	The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
tr	Pos	* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies .*
tr	Pos	Words can be lethal .
tr	Pos	It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
tr	Pos	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
tr	Pos	An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
tr	Pos	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Pos	But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
tr	Pos	Mr . Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
tr	Pos	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Pos	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Pos	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
tr	Pos	When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
tr	Pos	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Pos	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Pos	Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
tr	Pos	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
tr	Pos	You will not believe your own eyes .
tr	Pos	But words also work in other ways , more subtle .
tr	Pos	"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam ' s regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration ""."
tr	Pos	You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
tr	Pos	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid - day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
tr	Pos	She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
tr	Pos	"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and "" activist "" by the European press ."
tr	Pos	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
tr	Pos	"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "", the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader ""."
tr	Pos	There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
tr	Pos	These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
tr	Pos	They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
tr	Pos	* 3 . The third aspect is money .*
tr	Pos	Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
tr	Pos	In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
tr	Pos	The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
tr	Pos	The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
tr	Pos	These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
tr	Pos	They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
tr	Pos	Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
tr	Pos	This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
tr	Pos	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Pos	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Pos	The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO ' s and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
tr	Pos	The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
tr	Pos	The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
tr	Pos	Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
tr	Pos	Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
tr	Pos	The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
tr	Pos	Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
tr	Pos	Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
tr	Pos	"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
tr	Pos	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Pos	* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws .*
tr	Pos	The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
tr	Pos	There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
tr	Pos	Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
tr	Pos	Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti - democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
tr	Pos	Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
tr	Pos	"Does free speech protect you when you shout "" fire "" in a crowded theater ?"
tr	Pos	Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?
tr	Pos	These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
tr	Pos	But now we have an entire new set .
tr	Pos	Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
tr	Pos	Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
tr	Pos	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Pos	Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
tr	Pos	All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
tr	Pos	Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
tr	Pos	The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
tr	Pos	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Pos	International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
tr	Pos	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Pos	"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as "" war criminals ,"" with some Western media repeating the allegations ."
tr	Pos	The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
tr	Pos	After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
tr	Pos	The picture I described here is not pretty .
tr	Pos	In the short run , only fight and win .
tr	Pos	In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
tr	Pos	The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
tr	Pos	The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force .
tr	Pos	Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter - propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
tr	Pos	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Pos	Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
tr	Pos	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Pos	"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" supplies "" from expanding the tumor ."
tr	Pos	But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
tr	Pos	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Pos	I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre - war argument , but I can look at the post - war map of Western Asia .
tr	Pos	Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
tr	Pos	As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
tr	Pos	Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
tr	Pos	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Pos	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Pos	I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
tr	Pos	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Pos	It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
tr	Pos	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Pos	It is ruthless .
tr	Pos	It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
tr	Pos	It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
tr	Pos	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Pos	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Pos	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Pos	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Pos	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Pos	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Pos	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Pos	No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
tr	Pos	The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
tr	Pos	In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
tr	Pos	Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
tr	Pos	If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
tr	Pos	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Pos	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Pos	On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
tr	Pos	I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
tr	Pos	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Pos	"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."""
tr	Pos	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Pos	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Pos	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Pos	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Pos	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Pos	"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ("" CIA "") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax ."
tr	Pos	"An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "" unbelievable "" biological attack , the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("" KSM "")."
tr	Pos	He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
tr	Pos	In November 2003 , a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties .
tr	Pos	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Pos	"According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda ’ s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face ."""
tr	Pos	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Pos	In a bulletin , the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon .
tr	Pos	The CIA reportedly has been quietly building a case that the anthrax mailings were an international plot .
tr	Pos	This is old news .
tr	Pos	It ' s just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI ' s ( former ) theory about a lone , American scientist .
tr	Pos	Many people have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the mailings served as a threat and warning .
tr	Pos	Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis has explained that while islamists may disagree about whether killing innocents is sanctioned by the laws of jihad , extremists like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used .
tr	Pos	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Pos	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
tr	Pos	Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 , included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise .
tr	Pos	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Pos	The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities .
tr	Pos	Mabruk , at the time , was the head of Jihad ' s military operations .
tr	Pos	There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development .
tr	Pos	Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9 / 11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
tr	Pos	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Pos	"In March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9 / 11 but was to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Pos	KSM explained that Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US - trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative , Malaysian Yazid Sufaat .
tr	Pos	Al Qaeda ' s regional operative , Hambali , who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat , has been captured .
tr	Pos	KSM and Hambali sent al - Hindi ( al - Britani ), along with Jafar the Pilot , to case NYC targets for a second wave .
tr	Pos	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Pos	Sufaat , according to both KSM and Hambali , did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used .
tr	Pos	But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri ' s decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter .
tr	Pos	The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years .
tr	Pos	Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
tr	Pos	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Pos	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Pos	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .

tr	Pos	"A few days before Christmas 2003 , after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks , to include in the US homeland , the threat level was raised to orange or "" high ."""
tr	Pos	After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow , Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape .
tr	Pos	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Pos	The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released .
tr	Pos	Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
tr	Pos	In May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9 / 11 Commission .
tr	Pos	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Pos	The same week , the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes , they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received .
tr	Pos	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Pos	Zawahiri , Al Qaeda ' s # 2 , is head of Al Qaeda ' s biochemical program .
tr	Pos	The CIA has known of Zawahiri ' s plans to use anthrax for a half decade .
tr	Pos	The confidante and right - hand man of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets .
tr	Pos	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Pos	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Pos	A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
tr	Pos	The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts .
tr	Pos	There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 .
tr	Pos	Significantly , the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ), upon being contacted , does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft . Detrick .
tr	Pos	Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources .
tr	Pos	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Pos	Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed ' s computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons .
tr	Pos	In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings , there was an electrostatic charge .
tr	Pos	Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns .
tr	Pos	Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
tr	Pos	"The "" trillion spore "" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
tr	Pos	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Pos	USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , in sensational detail , of Atta ' s inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster .
tr	Pos	Although the details of the documents on Mohammed ' s computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings .
tr	Pos	US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9 / 11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 .
tr	Pos	Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda .
tr	Pos	"( Green symbolizes "" Islam "" and Prophet Mohammed ' s holy war )."
tr	Pos	"The crop dusters were to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Pos	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Pos	As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino .
tr	Pos	"Newsweek reported that a "" second wave "" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support ."
tr	Pos	Various doctors , both foreign and American , are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives , to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan , a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui , PhD , from Karachi .
tr	Pos	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Pos	Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning .
tr	Pos	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Pos	If mistaken , how did those reports first come about ?
tr	Pos	Understandably , Amerithrax is a confidential investigation .
tr	Pos	The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt .
tr	Pos	As agent Van Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation said , the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information .
tr	Pos	While it ' s not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought .
tr	Pos	According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative ' s house ).
tr	Pos	"The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda ' s "" Chemical Wire Group ."""
tr	Pos	The family ' s lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station .
tr	Pos	That was the last Ismat heard from her .
tr	Pos	"Perhaps something got lost in the translation , but the phrase "" Chemical Wire Group "" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers ."
tr	Pos	"There still is a very hot pursuit of the "" Atta - level "" Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting ."
tr	Pos	A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot .
tr	Pos	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Pos	He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also has received pilot training .
tr	Pos	The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically - based preconceptions .
tr	Pos	In early June 2003 , a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax .
tr	Pos	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Pos	The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan .
tr	Pos	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Pos	The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program at Kandahar .
tr	Pos	The present evidence relating to Atta ' s alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq .
tr	Pos	Iraq , however , remains a possible source of the Ames .
tr	Pos	Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain .
tr	Pos	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Pos	The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq ' s secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
tr	Pos	Two top Iraqi scientists , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi ' s anthrax program , according to Dr . David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
tr	Pos	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Pos	"The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "" liberals ."""
tr	Pos	"Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "" Leahy Law "" to military and security forces ."
tr	Pos	That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals .
tr	Pos	Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI ' s involvement in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries .
tr	Pos	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Pos	Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries .
tr	Pos	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Pos	This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remains foremost in the mind of Dr . Zawahiri .
tr	Pos	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Pos	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Pos	Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq .
tr	Pos	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Pos	Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
tr	Pos	The FBI ' s profile includes a US - based supporter of the militant islamists .
tr	Pos	"Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "" either - or "" approach is not useful ."
tr	Pos	"The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "" domestic "" the word includes a US - based , highly - educated supporter of the militant islamists ."
tr	Pos	There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage .
tr	Pos	A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the conclusion that there were not one , but two , such mailings containing anthrax .
tr	Pos	( The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun ).
tr	Pos	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Pos	The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D . C ..
tr	Pos	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Pos	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
tr	Pos	The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message .
tr	Pos	( There initially was an outstanding $ 2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program , the reward now is up to $ 5 million .).
tr	Pos	Once one had been received , the next ten , mailed on two separate dates , were easily collected .
tr	Pos	Sound familiar ?
tr	Pos	"Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned , addressed to "" Parole Officer ."""
tr	Pos	That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 .
tr	Pos	Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr . Abdul Qadoos Khan .
tr	Pos	Along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden .
tr	Pos	Although while in jail in the early 1980s , Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik ' s ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group , Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman ' s friends .
tr	Pos	Thus , the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center .
tr	Pos	"According to the controversial "" Feith memo ,"" which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi / Al Qaeda connection , Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent ."
tr	Pos	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Pos	A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
tr	Pos	"There ' s even a chapter titled "" Poisonous Letter "" in the Al Qaeda manual ."
tr	Pos	"The "" Federal Eagle "" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue - green ."
tr	Pos	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""
tr	Pos	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Pos	"A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "" In the Hearts of Green Birds "" refers to what is inside ."
tr	Pos	"The mailer ' s use of "" Greendale School "" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing ."
tr	Pos	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Pos	By Greendale School , the anthrax perp was being cute , just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
tr	Pos	Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i . e ., Cairo ' s Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group .
tr	Pos	The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
tr	Pos	At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained , recruits would wear green uniforms , except for Friday when they were washed .
tr	Pos	In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise .
tr	Pos	"As to opportunity , though seldom reported , there is a wealth of "" open source "" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada ."
tr	Pos	The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought .
tr	Pos	Zawahiri ' s mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes .
tr	Pos	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Pos	Whatever your political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve our support .
tr	Pos	First , the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI is doing .
tr	Pos	Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources .
tr	Pos	"Third , with the "" new age "" Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . in charge of the investigation , it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security ."
tr	Pos	"The "" Hatfill theory "" accusing Dr . Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious ."
tr	Pos	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .
tr	Pos	Leahy ' s chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right - winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted .
tr	Pos	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
tr	Pos	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
tr	Pos	The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
tr	Pos	The judge , frustrated by the apparent lack of progress , encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed ( and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint ).
tr	Pos	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Pos	A search of Dr . Ken Berry ' s residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory .
tr	Pos	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him .
tr	Pos	Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets ( August Board meeting ) one more time before I forward it to you .
tr	Pos	He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc .) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
tr	Pos	I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests .
tr	Pos	Puerto Rico CPI only ( I need historical inflation data , as well )
tr	Pos	Brazil we have current data already
tr	Pos	China we have current data already
tr	Pos	I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting / IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already .

tr	Pos	1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i . e ., ONSI would be a lot more money ).
tr	Pos	Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
tr	Pos	Remarkably clear explanation .
tr	Pos	That is some good stuff .
tr	Pos	I hear you are coming our way soon .
tr	Pos	Look forward to drinking a few beers .
tr	Pos	Yo Mama ` s so fat ....
tr	Pos	Your mama is so fat : When she hauls ass she has to make two trips .
tr	Pos	Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph .
tr	Pos	"Her driver ` s license says "" Picture continued on other side ."""
tr	Pos	The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs .
tr	Pos	"Yo mama ` s so fat , all the restaurants in town have signs that say : "" Maximum Occupancy : 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama "" Yo mama ` s so fat , when she ran away , they had to use all four sides of the milk carton ."
tr	Pos	Yo mama ` s so fat , instead of Levis 501 jeans , she wears Levi ` s 1002 ` s .
tr	Pos	Yo mama ` s so fat , when she gets in an elevator , it HAS to go down .
tr	Pos	Yo mama ` s so fat , she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth .
tr	Pos	Yo mama ` s so fat , she ` s got smaller fat women orbiting around her .
tr	Pos	Yo mama ` s so fat , she could sell shade .
tr	Pos	Done !
tr	Pos	What are some good interview questions ?
tr	Pos	Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive ?
tr	Pos	All the guys at work are saying I shouldn ' t bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one .
tr	Pos	I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book ( I only wrote it in my red book ).
tr	Pos	The deed is done .
tr	Pos	Dan is really smart and a hard worker .
tr	Pos	I think he would be a good fit .
tr	Pos	I ' ll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not .
tr	Pos	We should try to have a conference call with the west desk to discuss as soon as we can .
tr	Pos	I will be able to attend .
tr	Pos	Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle ' s help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
tr	Pos	We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
tr	Pos	Late Jan sounds great .
tr	Pos	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation ( big dance that she and I are committed to help with ), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion .
tr	Pos	So the last weekend in January would work well ( and I will need a rest from formal affairs !).
tr	Pos	Talked to the little mother - to - be .
tr	Pos	She said a shower would be grand .
tr	Pos	She has some big presentation mid - January .
tr	Pos	How does late January sound to you .
tr	Pos	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Pos	On the means of delivery , I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent .
tr	Pos	With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .
tr	Pos	With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .
tr	Pos	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations .
tr	Pos	I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .
tr	Pos	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent ' s return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .
tr	Pos	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards .
tr	Pos	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .
tr	Pos	There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report .
tr	Pos	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against .
tr	Pos	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
tr	Pos	Sorry that this response looks so long .
tr	Pos	We have been able to keep ENA ' s direct group expenses flat year on year , we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
tr	Pos	Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
tr	Pos	Don ' t worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker .
tr	Pos	In some respects I don ' t think the first panel could have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for different reasons ).
tr	Pos	The other staff reports are also looking good .
tr	Pos	Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is .
tr	Pos	Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large , regulated utility in California .
tr	Pos	You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
tr	Pos	Does she have any interest in meeting one - on - one or is she just looking for a public hanging ?
tr	Pos	I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach .
tr	Pos	Given the short notice , we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday , but will let the good Senator know that , in general , we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody .
tr	Pos	There are still four important issues , however :
tr	Pos	This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
tr	Pos	No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
tr	Pos	WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
tr	Pos	HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous .
tr	Pos	HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .
tr	Pos	Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
tr	Pos	Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e - mail ).
tr	Pos	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Pos	The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
tr	Pos	Please let us know if you have additional questions .
tr	Pos	Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we can ' t and where they are ?
tr	Pos	Are whole offices ( eg Tokyo ) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices ?
tr	Pos	As you can see from the Design Document , they are pretty significant .
tr	Pos	it ' s did you watch your girl on tv last night ?
tr	Pos	Did you do a deal with National Fuel Marketing purchasing 3 , 500 mmbtu on May 30th @ 2 . 975 ?
tr	Pos	Ok to book for me and my husband , Joseph .
tr	Pos	I was issued a new corporate American Express card .
tr	Pos	Same number with expiration date of 3 / 03 .
tr	Pos	Actually - upon second look the deal number is 814014 - why can ' t you see this ?

tr	Pos	a few things regading the POA / Cargill line ..
tr	Pos	I am going to find out how much line we currently have available ... you probably already have this .
tr	Pos	We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line , putting us over the limit , without me knowing ...
tr	Pos	I think this would solve our main concern ...
tr	Pos	Please let me know ... we are eager to keep trading with Global and yourselves ...

tr	Pos	We had a nice Thanksgiving here too .
tr	Pos	It ' s funny , because usually it ' s just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia doesn ' t really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me !), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
tr	Pos	It was good having the girls down .

tr	Pos	Then , also , he ' s got so much stuff in there right now , that I don ' t know how he ' s going to fit baby stuff .

tr	Pos	And his apartment is so run down down I ' m afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby .
tr	Pos	I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
tr	Pos	You ' ll have to come visit to check out my new house .
tr	Pos	"The upstairs "" guest suite "" is pretty neat ."
tr	Pos	It ' s got its own bathroom and tv , and is pretty cozy .
tr	Pos	As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes , if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn ' t tell by his voice .
tr	Pos	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Pos	It ' s good chatting with you .
tr	Pos	Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving , I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I ' ve ever had ( I not gonna tell them that , I don ' t want them getting swell heads ).
tr	Pos	Ma said she had a great time in Houston , She was happy to see yourself , as well as C & D .
tr	Pos	I think she likes her special room in your house .
tr	Pos	Your gonna be the first to see the new baby ( woudn ' t it be wierd if the baby gets botn on Jan 5th ?)
tr	Pos	What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben ( he was almost shocked )?

tr	Pos	Let me know if the notice information is OK with you .
tr	Pos	I ' m not sure you have the authority to sign documents w / o special authority ...
tr	Pos	"Adding all the Enron "" Specified Entities "" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement ."
tr	Pos	Our concern is that we don ' t want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component .
tr	Pos	If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
tr	Pos	"With respect to Deutsche Bank ("""" DB ""), we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
tr	Pos	With respect to First Union National Bank , the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11 / 8 / 00 for review .
tr	Pos	First Union National Bank
tr	Pos	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co - signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we ' re OK .
tr	Pos	The referenced TAGG # was entered as a ' New Counterparty ', can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure .
tr	Pos	Sorry I haven ' t written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated .
tr	Pos	I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don ' t think I ' m going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
tr	Pos	As much fun as they are , I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them .
tr	Pos	As for Ted , things are still going well although I haven ' t see him at all this week ( we are two very busy people ).
tr	Pos	But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
tr	Pos	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Pos	Anyway , I ' m sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
tr	Pos	Things in Houston are good and definitely warm .
tr	Pos	"I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" Rent "" and it was wonderful ."
tr	Pos	Needless to say I am very excited .
tr	Pos	Talk to you guys soon ,
tr	Pos	A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul .
tr	Pos	I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
tr	Pos	Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo ! Messenger .
tr	Pos	Hey Tonto ( a . k . a - the trusty , but silent , side - kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D )
tr	Pos	The play was very good and I think well received .
tr	Pos	I ' d forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
tr	Pos	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling ).
tr	Pos	I caught the third day of Corey ' s Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job !).
tr	Pos	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Pos	As a result of that , she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me ( The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia ).
tr	Pos	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went .
tr	Pos	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn ' t spell her name right in the email - I mean it ' s such a common spelling .
tr	Pos	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they ' d make a good match ?
tr	Pos	She ' s a very fun girl .
tr	Pos	Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch .
tr	Pos	"Good luck with all of the "" fun "" meetings ."
tr	Pos	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Pos	Smart girl .
tr	Pos	I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
tr	Pos	Anyway , lots of fun meetings today .
tr	Pos	However , having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors .
tr	Pos	I ' ll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
tr	Pos	Now back to what ' s really important ... you .
tr	Pos	I know I need some of your organizational skills .
tr	Pos	How ' s life on 32 today -- well that ' s enough about you let ' s talk more about me .
tr	Pos	As we discussed , the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue :
tr	Pos	"EnronOnline will assist users , upon request , in arranging for the connection of "" T1 "" lines or other means of direct access to EnronOnline , as an alternative to internet access ."
tr	Pos	Direct access connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access .

tr	Pos	I think it ' s a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ).
tr	Pos	We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages ( like the homepage ).
tr	Pos	I ' m not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually , I ' m sure I don ' t have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me .
tr	Pos	We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL implementation .

tr	Pos	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
tr	Pos	Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end )?
tr	Pos	If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
tr	Pos	Evidently , this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now .
tr	Pos	I believe that there might be a sign - flipping problem for PUTS that ' s causing this whole issue .

tr	Pos	Dear Justin
tr	Pos	As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
tr	Pos	Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ), I ' d say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
tr	Pos	However , if you use a particular logo for the on - line service , that should be registered .
tr	Pos	I hope the above is clear .
tr	Pos	Can one of you give me a quick call to discuss .
tr	Pos	"I assume this is akin to why McDonald ' s trademarks "" Mc "" Everything ?"

tr	Pos	For banks incorporated in a non - approved jurisdiction , it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction ( i . e . U . S . and U . K . branches ).
tr	Pos	Yes , we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and / or Commodity Contracts and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act ( Alberta ), Securities Act ( British Columbia ) and Securities Act ( Ontario ).
tr	Pos	"With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with , do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "" eligible swap participant "" equivalant rules ?"

tr	Pos	We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas , which adds the Canadian Securities Representation , so we don ' t have to add the rep into every confirm .

tr	Pos	Much thanks .
tr	Pos	Updating another blue file because Susan B ., this time , has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes !

tr	Pos	Additional resources are being allocated and the situation is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operations ).
tr	Pos	Please contact me if you require any additional information
tr	Pos	Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .
tr	Pos	that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses , AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable )
tr	Pos	an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
tr	Pos	The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
tr	Pos	The signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate ' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
tr	Pos	A reconciling difference of $ 15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p & l as generated on the AS400 .
tr	Pos	We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .
tr	Pos	However , this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p & l values with traders .
tr	Pos	The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
tr	Pos	Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
tr	Pos	the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co - ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ), requiring full download of contract detail for later reference
tr	Pos	reconciliation of stock movements between 23rd and 30th sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
tr	Pos	detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
tr	Pos	spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
tr	Pos	the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
tr	Pos	the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd
tr	Pos	Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business .
tr	Pos	The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA ' s signoff for the facility late in the year end audit .
tr	Pos	The discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the AS400 Merchanting code , arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality , which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF .
tr	Pos	The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
tr	Pos	The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave .
tr	Pos	The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
tr	Pos	Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet .
tr	Pos	The AR / AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1 .
tr	Pos	Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses .
tr	Pos	An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations .
tr	Pos	The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA / excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads .
tr	Pos	User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF .
tr	Pos	A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
tr	Pos	A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates

tr	Pos	Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
tr	Pos	Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
tr	Pos	Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
tr	Pos	Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
tr	Pos	A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation , where applicable , and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
tr	Pos	A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices / request for payment )
tr	Pos	A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
tr	Pos	A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
tr	Pos	I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April
tr	Pos	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year .
tr	Pos	I understand how competitive the process has become , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , personality , extracurricular activities , etc . that this would compensate for my disability .
tr	Pos	After talking with Professors Titman , Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for .
tr	Pos	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Pos	Due to my disability , this will be a monumental task ; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business .
tr	Pos	If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .

tr	Pos	Sorry about that , I was working on the Teco O & M costs .
tr	Pos	I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
tr	Pos	As such , please provide the following detail :
tr	Pos	Will we be valuing / booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options ?
tr	Pos	Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/ MWh to value the deal ?
tr	Pos	What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra - day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols )?
tr	Pos	What expiration date are you using , i . e .: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?
tr	Pos	What correlation are you assuming , 15 % flat for twenty years ?
tr	Pos	"Are you using the "" SPRDOPT "" Exotic Options function to value the option ?"
tr	Pos	Yvan , and Ben , please provide answers to these question via written correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding .
tr	Pos	Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far .
tr	Pos	Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC ' s goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
tr	Pos	"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to "" work in good faith with CDEC "" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC ' s system ."
tr	Pos	"We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "" assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses "" associated with the manual system ."
tr	Pos	In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .
tr	Pos	We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected , but let me know what we can do .
tr	Pos	James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info . from CDEC .
tr	Pos	My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC ' s online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC ' s peak load periods .
tr	Pos	We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200 , 987 . 33 for the period of July through September .
tr	Pos	Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , that I have not been able to review yet .
tr	Pos	Good point , but I ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .
tr	Pos	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .
tr	Pos	Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates .
tr	Pos	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?
tr	Pos	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
tr	Pos	My concern with adding the language below is , could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate ??
tr	Pos	After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we ' ve done .
tr	Pos	In discussion with Dave , we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers .
tr	Pos	However , as you will see , the questions I thought of got kinda long - but I think we need answers for all of them .
tr	Pos	One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I ' ve listed .
tr	Pos	It incorporates Mr . Stojic ' s and Mr . Kelly ' s initial comments .
tr	Pos	Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair ( she only wanted one , however ).
tr	Pos	This particular chair is designed to help with back problems , which she has .
tr	Pos	Many people at Enron already have this type of chair , but we rarely , if ever , have a surplus because they are so popular .

tr	Pos	Please disregard and destroy the form you received on July 2 , as well as any blank forms retrieved from the PEP system prior to that date .
tr	Pos	We do need a formal plan .
tr	Pos	Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information .
tr	Pos	We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
tr	Pos	The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue , providing specific examples and proposing the solution .
tr	Pos	Grand - standing is ignored .
tr	Pos	Those who show up and complain , but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls , board meetings , etc . are ignored .
tr	Pos	Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
tr	Pos	We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised .
tr	Pos	There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th .
tr	Pos	The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom .
tr	Pos	Thane is in Austin on Friday , but is available by phone .
tr	Pos	I am available after Rick ' s Friday budget meeting ... are you available then ?
tr	Pos	You are right , we do need a formal plan , Thane has started an initial draft .
tr	Pos	Walking out last night , Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets .
tr	Pos	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Pos	As important , the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market .
tr	Pos	Let ' s get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference .
tr	Pos	Jean and Thane , I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation .
tr	Pos	I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick ' s budget meeting .
tr	Pos	As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago , we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities , and possibly electric activities , in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders .
tr	Pos	We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order , filing , etc . with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information .
tr	Pos	Many details remain to be worked out , but we will keep you advised .
tr	Pos	In the meantime , could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues ?
tr	Pos	I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems .
tr	Pos	I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston .
tr	Pos	The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel .
tr	Pos	Please , let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization .
tr	Pos	I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview .

tr	Pos	Product Additional Information ( example ):
tr	Pos	"The Transaction is for hot rolled steel with a thickness of 1 "" and a width of 72 inches ."

tr	Pos	"We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include , "" a division of Cargill Incorporated ""."
tr	Pos	We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty .
tr	Pos	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Pos	The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty ' s name from Global Counterparty .
tr	Pos	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .
tr	Pos	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
tr	Pos	That is the source of Tana ' s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
tr	Pos	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
tr	Pos	In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .
tr	Pos	Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill , Inc .
tr	Pos	Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub - to - Legal Link to Cargill , Inc . per GCP procedure .
tr	Pos	Also , the Global SAP team ( Cheryl Johnson ) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name .
tr	Pos	Samuel x3 - 9890 ( GCP ) Enron Net Works _ Global Data Management
tr	Pos	Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name ?
tr	Pos	Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Pos	( Although , we have broken that rule for Legal in the past .)
tr	Pos	With divisions , EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below .
tr	Pos	Sam , please confirm , Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .

tr	Pos	Confidential Settlement Document Per CPUC Rule 51
tr	Pos	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Pos	As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
tr	Pos	* Offers a 7 . 5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
tr	Pos	* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3 . 5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
tr	Pos	The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *
tr	Pos	* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *
tr	Pos	PG & E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today ' s mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
tr	Pos	We would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of Word , upon request by individual Parties .
tr	Pos	Few points :
tr	Pos	Our time is likely to be limited to 5 - 10 minutes .

tr	Pos	Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will forward that along for folks review later today .
tr	Pos	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).

tr	Pos	That ' s a very good point .
tr	Pos	"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
tr	Pos	In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
tr	Pos	We ' re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
tr	Pos	But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .
tr	Pos	"The administration is hell bent on finding a "" fall guy ."""
tr	Pos	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
tr	Pos	And Carl Wood ' s remarks were extreme .
tr	Pos	At the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked arms in calling for refunds .
tr	Pos	"The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "" real "" investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works ."
tr	Pos	On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
tr	Pos	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Pos	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Pos	IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
tr	Pos	In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .
tr	Pos	"In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) "" played by the rules ,"" but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers ."
tr	Pos	You ' re right , Sue .
tr	Pos	Harry also had a good comment --- don ' t specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
tr	Pos	The Associate and Analyst Programs will be on the Penn , undergraduate campus interviewing summer Analyst interns next week .
tr	Pos	Sorry about that before .
tr	Pos	Tom Byargeon , Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana / Texas oil and gas drilling projects .
tr	Pos	This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities .
tr	Pos	Just like what happened in Enron ' s initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects .
tr	Pos	They are currently working on a bid ( due 1 / 31 ) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy ( operator ), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
tr	Pos	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40 , 000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
tr	Pos	Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon ' s West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
tr	Pos	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Pos	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95 , 000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
tr	Pos	Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?
tr	Pos	Please address , and I ' ll check with Legal as well .
tr	Pos	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Pos	these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .
tr	Pos	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Pos	we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .
tr	Pos	even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .
tr	Pos	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Pos	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .
tr	Pos	Dear Mr . Shankman ,
tr	Pos	Thank you very much for your quick reply .

tr	Pos	That girl ' s mother sounds like a real problem .
tr	Pos	I ' m not sure how I would have handled it .
tr	Pos	Here ' s a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7 : 35am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I ' d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
tr	Pos	The mother was running late for work and could not wait .
tr	Pos	I couldn ' t say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs . old ) and I waited for the bus .
tr	Pos	I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own .
tr	Pos	Pretty strange ... aye .
tr	Pos	Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8 : 30am ).
tr	Pos	There were only 15 minutes left of class .
tr	Pos	And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe .
tr	Pos	Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well .
tr	Pos	I spoke to her prior to my note .
tr	Pos	Is there anyone else in EGM that could participate ?
tr	Pos	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
tr	Pos	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Pos	I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers ( Managers or above ).
tr	Pos	We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon .
tr	Pos	We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9am - 12pm ) or afternoon ( 2pm - 5pm ) complete session .
tr	Pos	In addition , we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer .

tr	Pos	11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I ' m not sure exists .
tr	Pos	I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .
tr	Pos	Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
tr	Pos	1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer ' s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T & D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer ' s utility .
tr	Pos	"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers ."
tr	Pos	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Pos	"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs )."
tr	Pos	"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ..."
tr	Pos	Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched .
tr	Pos	If you are comfortable , we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms .
tr	Pos	"P . S . Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "" hiatus "" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7 / 16 ."
tr	Pos	Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of the language that makes the LC transferable .
tr	Pos	Are you okay with that ?
tr	Pos	If so , are we ready to execute ?
tr	Pos	I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions .
tr	Pos	In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form , I think you should add a forward contract rep .
tr	Pos	As I mentioned in my e - mail , John Lepore at Select Energy ( Settlements Group ) is trying to reconcile our list with his list .
tr	Pos	We need to include all outstanding transactions .
tr	Pos	Just let me know and I can send you a new attachment .
tr	Pos	Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the version that you sent to me the current version ?
tr	Pos	I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
tr	Pos	I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we ' re all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
tr	Pos	As far as the EEI goes , the only remaining issue that I ' m aware of ( aside from finalizing the LOC ) is whether we ' ve finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions .
tr	Pos	Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week .
tr	Pos	Are we ready to execute ?
tr	Pos	It simply refers to the same ICC publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit generally .
tr	Pos	Is there some specific concern that we can address ?
tr	Pos	Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
tr	Pos	Our system did not show any other chnages .

tr	Pos	"They ' re holding "" workshops "" on how it will all work soon ."
tr	Pos	The Orange County Register
tr	Pos	"The investigative committee , headed by state Sen . Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : "" the palace coup ."""
tr	Pos	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Pos	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Pos	""" I don ' t know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort ,"" said Dunn ."
tr	Pos	The subpoenas will force those involved , including Winter , to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee , and to turn over e - mails , personal calendars and memos .
tr	Pos	"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter ."
tr	Pos	""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis ,"" Maviglio said ."
tr	Pos	Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .
tr	Pos	ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn ' s committee will find no criminal conduct .
tr	Pos	The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the lights on .
tr	Pos	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct . 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .
tr	Pos	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .
tr	Pos	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Pos	Records show that on Oct . 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .
tr	Pos	The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators .
tr	Pos	""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity ,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III ."
tr	Pos	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .
tr	Pos	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Pos	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Pos	The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .
tr	Pos	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Pos	What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .
tr	Pos	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Pos	Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .
tr	Pos	With the price caps gone , the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs .
tr	Pos	""" The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor ' s key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment ,'' Maviglio said ."
tr	Pos	""" It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant ."
tr	Pos	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .
tr	Pos	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .
tr	Pos	""" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Pos	Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .
tr	Pos	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Pos	""" Terry did this by himself ,'' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
tr	Pos	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Pos	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed , but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos , the governor ' s spokesman Maviglio said .
tr	Pos	James J . Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter .
tr	Pos	""" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark ,'' Hoecker said ."
tr	Pos	""" They ( ISO management ) did what any independent system operator would do ."""
tr	Pos	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Pos	""" We don ' t know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out ,"" Dunn said ."
tr	Pos	I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA ( for customers already on DA ).
tr	Pos	Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter .
tr	Pos	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .
tr	Pos	Sounds good .
tr	Pos	"I suggest a "" blind draw "" on the teams , best ball not scramble on the golf , and as for the wager , no emails from the losing team for one week !"
tr	Pos	As I recall , Montavano , Shapiro and I usually make up one team , but I ' m willing to switch around a bit .
tr	Pos	There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation , but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show .
tr	Pos	"Where is the "" simple "" explanation of the transportation piece ?"
tr	Pos	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Pos	Accordingly , the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP ( the only one and therefore the one they have to choose ) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract .

tr	Pos	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .

tr	Pos	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Pos	"Now , NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with "" go "" fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches ."
tr	Pos	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
tr	Pos	"Seeing another "" Columbia "" incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas )."
tr	Pos	Maybe one day they will allow space tourism , ( hopefully that will be in the near future ) although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones .
tr	Pos	Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems ( as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses ).
tr	Pos	But supporters are pointing a few good things out :
tr	Pos	Clearly , the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel .
tr	Pos	A few weeks ago , shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry .
tr	Pos	One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed .
tr	Pos	"The other is a new fuel tank "" guaranteed "" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation ."

tr	Pos	"In George Orwell ' s influential novel "" 1984 "" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "" war is peace ""."
tr	Pos	I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body , mind and soul .
tr	Pos	Think of all life , if you will , as one great choir or one grand congregation .
tr	Pos	Any major dischord and we all suffer .
tr	Pos	Any insult to the collective good brings us all down .
tr	Pos	Living out of synch with nature is the great disease , from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness .
tr	Pos	We are only as strong as our weakest , we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager .
tr	Pos	When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down .
tr	Pos	When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do , not only are they hurting us , but they are hurting themselves .
tr	Pos	There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
tr	Pos	We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment , our rejection of the natural for the industrial , and our embrace of violence over peace .
tr	Pos	Remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else , remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny .
tr	Pos	Fortunately circumstances will force our hand soon since our collective bad behaviour cannot continue indefinitely .
tr	Pos	In the near future collective choices will need to be made .

tr	Pos	A Quebec man was awarded a Carnegie Medal for bravery on Monday for saving two friends by fighting off a polar bear with a pocket knife two years ago on Baffin Island
tr	Pos	Dr . Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que ., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two friends who were being mauled .
tr	Pos	""" My first thought was to push it away ,"" he said ."
tr	Pos	The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears .
tr	Pos	The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack , experts said .
tr	Pos	The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
tr	Pos	Dr . Fortier threw a large rock at the bear , distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , who was in the same tent .
tr	Pos	Again Dr . Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
tr	Pos	"I was beside the bear ' s head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times ."""
tr	Pos	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Pos	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon , however , were bleeding badly .
tr	Pos	"The bronze medal is given to people who "" risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others ."""

tr	Pos	Dear Sir / Madam ,
tr	Pos	I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH , son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush , and currently serving as President of the United States of America .
tr	Pos	I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence .
tr	Pos	I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
tr	Pos	My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
tr	Pos	In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my father , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran .
tr	Pos	This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U . S .- British subsidiary .
tr	Pos	Out of that cost , thirty - six billion dollars ($ 36 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) were supplied by King Hussein , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies , and sixteen billion dollars ($ 16 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) by German and Japanese partners .
tr	Pos	But my father ' s former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
tr	Pos	My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
tr	Pos	Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($ 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 ), both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
tr	Pos	Without the funds from our 1991 partners , we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq .
tr	Pos	That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance .
tr	Pos	Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice - president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
tr	Pos	I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty - five percent ( 10 - 25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture .
tr	Pos	The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary .
tr	Pos	I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried .
tr	Pos	But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day .
tr	Pos	A bold step taken shall not be regretted , I assure you .
tr	Pos	Please do be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal .
tr	Pos	If you do not wish to co - operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter .
tr	Pos	My family and our colleagues will be forever grateful .
tr	Pos	Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below .

tr	Pos	Also , from their own webpage , reasons why NASA is important , in a 5th grade format .
tr	Pos	I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
tr	Pos	Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently , crossed a modern bridge , flown in an airplane , recieved any form of modern medicine , did any mathematics , drove a car , used a cellular phone , etc . then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us .
tr	Pos	Also NASA has a large outreach program for education , some people believe this is important .
tr	Pos	i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers ' money , but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies , that i find it best not to think about it .
tr	Pos	i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste , but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA .
tr	Pos	of course , in a perfect world , tax payers ' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program , and housing for the homeless , but this is far from a perfect world .
tr	Pos	in response to Steve ' s comment : do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone ?

tr	Pos	China ' s insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
tr	Pos	An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China ' s soaring economic growth .
tr	Pos	Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol
tr	Pos	The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .
tr	Pos	"The submarine incident was put down to a "" technical error "" by the Chinese government , which apologised to Japan ."
tr	Pos	"But even before the incident the People ' s Daily , the government mouthpiece , had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "" only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy ""."
tr	Pos	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .
tr	Pos	The West , however , has paid little attention to these developments .
tr	Pos	"For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China ' s relations with "" pariah states ""."
tr	Pos	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .
tr	Pos	Then , this month , it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran ' s nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
tr	Pos	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Pos	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Pos	Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .
tr	Pos	Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities .
tr	Pos	Japan protested , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .
tr	Pos	The two are also set to clash over Russia ' s oil wealth .
tr	Pos	China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East .
tr	Pos	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Pos	Increasingly , analysts are saying that China ' s efforts have gone beyond what is safe or even in its own interests .
tr	Pos	Claude Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly worth the trouble .

tr	Pos	Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
tr	Pos	If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .
tr	Pos	Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that .
tr	Pos	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Pos	Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
tr	Pos	Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth .
tr	Pos	Your breathing should be calm and relaxed , through the nose .
tr	Pos	1 . Warm Sun Visualization
tr	Pos	Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
tr	Pos	Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ), the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
tr	Pos	As you sit above the world , the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer .
tr	Pos	The golden rays feel soft and soothing .
tr	Pos	Now you are far above the earth - into space .
tr	Pos	Everything around you is so vast .
tr	Pos	Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
tr	Pos	Your muscles are loose and limp .
tr	Pos	Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
tr	Pos	With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
tr	Pos	You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
tr	Pos	This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .
tr	Pos	Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
tr	Pos	A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
tr	Pos	Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .
tr	Pos	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Pos	Feel that you ' re sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
tr	Pos	Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction .
tr	Pos	Feel you ' re completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
tr	Pos	"Its meaning is "" Infinite happiness is everywhere ""."
tr	Pos	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Pos	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Pos	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
tr	Pos	Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process .
tr	Pos	Feel you ' re surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
tr	Pos	Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .
tr	Pos	OK that is fairly basic :).
tr	Pos	The important point is to develop some psycho - spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
tr	Pos	Don ' t worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that ' s normal .
tr	Pos	It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
tr	Pos	The main thing is to keep practicing .
tr	Pos	Well maybe a miracle could happen , but lets face it we ' re ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !
tr	Pos	NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY
tr	Pos	From what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage .
tr	Pos	Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same - gender couples .
tr	Pos	One of “ NCRC4ME ’ s ” major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached “ Declaration of Religious Leaders ,” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature .
tr	Pos	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Pos	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real need for visible support for the “ pro - same - gender - marriage ” side of this issue .
tr	Pos	( Since the Declaration is written as coming from “ religious leaders ,” people who don ’ t consider themselves “ religious leaders ” can sign as “ Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality .”)
tr	Pos	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
tr	Pos	If you have any questions please feel free to call me ( after Sat . the 26th , when I will return from a trip ).
tr	Pos	Sign - up lists will be available at the services on Feb . 27 and March 6 , or you can email me .
tr	Pos	I will email names and email addresses ( or postal addresses ) of signers to NCRC4ME in time for their “ lobby day ” in Raleigh on March 15 .
tr	Pos	For the Church of the Holy Spirit Vestry ,
tr	Pos	North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality Declaration of Religious Leaders April 19 , 2004
tr	Pos	The most fundamental human right , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings .
tr	Pos	We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
tr	Pos	"This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "" secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity .”"
tr	Pos	"The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “ inalienable rights ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness ."""
tr	Pos	> From the shameful history of slavery in America , the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right .
tr	Pos	The American laws forbidding interracial marriage , now struck down , were clearly discriminatory .
tr	Pos	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Pos	As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life .
tr	Pos	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
tr	Pos	As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
tr	Pos	We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
tr	Pos	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
tr	Pos	However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
tr	Pos	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .
tr	Pos	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Pos	Likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Pos	The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law .
tr	Pos	As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
tr	Pos	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
tr	Pos	My Fellow Americans :
tr	Pos	As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .
tr	Pos	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Pos	A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http :// loveallpeople . org / usconstitutiona . txt
tr	Pos	Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :
tr	Pos	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Pos	He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
tr	Pos	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Pos	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
tr	Pos	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Pos	His fellow judges love him .
tr	Pos	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Pos	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Pos	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan . 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
tr	Pos	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Pos	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Pos	"There is an old saying that applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure ."""
tr	Pos	Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
tr	Pos	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Pos	And because of this tragic flaw . . .
tr	Pos	""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President ."""
tr	Pos	In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
tr	Pos	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
tr	Pos	"But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President ."
tr	Pos	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .
tr	Pos	""" Commander In Chief "" doesn ' t mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
tr	Pos	Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .
tr	Pos	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
tr	Pos	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Pos	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .

tr	Pos	NASA & Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing Hoax a secret in modern times
tr	Pos	Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath .
tr	Pos	"Country has an Independent strategy = NASA & company to use "" Numero Uno "" strategy , try to assert , beat , mesh and control the space program of the country ."
tr	Pos	This can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
tr	Pos	"Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA & Company to use "" freeze thawed "" strategy especially when the country has a challenging , growing and ambitious space program ."
tr	Pos	This can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
tr	Pos	"Dependant = NASA & Company to use "" space station "" model to unify the aims of different countries ."
tr	Pos	The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries .
tr	Pos	China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
tr	Pos	Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program ' s goals
tr	Pos	China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China ' s Gansu Province .
tr	Pos	A pair of military pilots embarked on China ' s second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days .
tr	Pos	The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China ' s official news agency .
tr	Pos	The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
tr	Pos	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Pos	But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
tr	Pos	President Bush has directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers .
tr	Pos	"China ' s "" is not a fly - by - night program ,"" said Joan Johnson - Freese , an expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R . I ."
tr	Pos	"Economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program ."""
tr	Pos	China ' s overtures to join the U . S .- led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country ' s human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat .
tr	Pos	China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush ' s strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destinations .
tr	Pos	""" We wish them a successful return of their astronauts ."""
tr	Pos	He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week ' s Chinese mission through formal channels .
tr	Pos	At present , there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel said .
tr	Pos	The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese said .
tr	Pos	The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi - compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
tr	Pos	The Chinese program ' s second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques .
tr	Pos	The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
tr	Pos	""" The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly ,"" said John E . Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va .- based GlobalSecurity . org , a small national security think tank ."
tr	Pos	During the U . S . and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays .
tr	Pos	"""( China ) could be the second country to do that ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Pos	Pike ' s concern is based on China ' s development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea .
tr	Pos	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .
tr	Pos	I ' m a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
tr	Pos	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Pos	"The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their "" product "" as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love ."
tr	Pos	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Pos	Right now , while we ' re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
tr	Pos	The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust .
tr	Pos	I am serious about doing something .
tr	Pos	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Pos	"Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats "" Meowing ,"" I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture ."
tr	Pos	I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
tr	Pos	I was thinking , that while I ' m sitting here , relaxing and enjoying myself , those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust - esque death chambers .
tr	Pos	"This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
tr	Pos	I ' m not sure if any of you know much about civet cats , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles .
tr	Pos	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Pos	"The quote is from an article entitled "" Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem '"""
tr	Pos	If anyone wants the complete article , email me , as it is a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy .
tr	Pos	""" As an example , consider the treatment of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal ."
tr	Pos	Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds , where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires .
tr	Pos	What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment ?
tr	Pos	These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume .
tr	Pos	Musk , which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive , makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application .
tr	Pos	"To promote one of the most trivial interests we have , thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives ."""
tr	Pos	If anyone is interested in listening to this song , and in offering their opinion , whether it be positive or negative , I ' d appreciate it .
tr	Pos	But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download , especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine ( 28k ).
tr	Pos	Although there are no human vocals / lyrics , I think it ' s subject matter is audible .

tr	Pos	Blue Planet : Who ' s afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?
tr	Pos	UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
tr	Pos	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Pos	In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan ' s Lake Superior .
tr	Pos	The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
tr	Pos	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Pos	Their sheep could graze , their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard .
tr	Pos	After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .
tr	Pos	Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .
tr	Pos	In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .
tr	Pos	If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .
tr	Pos	Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
tr	Pos	If true , the caper failed .
tr	Pos	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Pos	This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .
tr	Pos	These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .
tr	Pos	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Pos	Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .
tr	Pos	"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf ' s relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
tr	Pos	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
tr	Pos	Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
tr	Pos	""" All you have to do is look at the photographs ,"" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI ' s Blue Planet ,"
tr	Pos	"An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow ."""
tr	Pos	This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .
tr	Pos	Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park ' s northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .
tr	Pos	""" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people ,"" Beschta told Blue Planet ."
tr	Pos	But we ' ve been looking at streamside communities .
tr	Pos	Since wolf recovery , streamside plants , willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing shrubs that bears can use .
tr	Pos	It ' s important with regard to the quality of streams .
tr	Pos	"Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems ."""
tr	Pos	Yellowstone has a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .
tr	Pos	Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
tr	Pos	""" I ' m pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations ,"" however , he cautioned ."
tr	Pos	""" Wolves are still pretty new ."
tr	Pos	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal ' s status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
tr	Pos	Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .
tr	Pos	Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .
tr	Pos	On Jan . 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E . Jones appeared to agree with them .
tr	Pos	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Pos	Wolves can migrate considerable distances .
tr	Pos	A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home .
tr	Pos	"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic ."""
tr	Pos	There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31 , 000 mountain lions .
tr	Pos	Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .

tr	Pos	Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?
tr	Pos	True , there are about 300 , 000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .
tr	Pos	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Pos	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .

tr	Pos	Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends , but meanwhile Earth ' s plants , insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome .
tr	Pos	Nina Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61 - year uninterrupted phenological records .
tr	Pos	Bradley ' s record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999 , spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data .
tr	Pos	The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to .
tr	Pos	The forest phlox is blooming in late April instead of mid - May .
tr	Pos	Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming .
tr	Pos	An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one - third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago .
tr	Pos	""" One of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities ,"" concluded a report titled "" Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States ,"" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week ."
tr	Pos	""" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change ,"" said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world ' s leading experts on this issue ."
tr	Pos	""" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding ,"" she said ."
tr	Pos	Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .
tr	Pos	""" Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver ,"" she said ."
tr	Pos	""" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable ."""
tr	Pos	Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .
tr	Pos	"Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many , many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean ."""
tr	Pos	"As the Pew report concluded , "" Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U . S . ecosystems ."""
tr	Pos	Such consequences include shifting and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems .
tr	Pos	The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .
tr	Pos	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""
tr	Pos	"The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "" Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ."""
tr	Pos	The ACIA -- with participation by the United States , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000 .
tr	Pos	""" The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic ,"" said ACIA chair Robert Corell ."
tr	Pos	""" The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth ."
tr	Pos	The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years .
tr	Pos	Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the assessment found , with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice .
tr	Pos	""" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction ,"" the report concluded ."
tr	Pos	As with so much climate research , not everyone agrees with these dire predictions .
tr	Pos	"A third report , "" The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future ,"" completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category ."
tr	Pos	"On the one hand , the IPN report agreed "" Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise ."
tr	Pos	"This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase ."""
tr	Pos	On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .
tr	Pos	""" The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge ,"" the IPN report said ."
tr	Pos	""" A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic ."""
tr	Pos	The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster .
tr	Pos	Important species that probably would decline include shrimp , capelin , Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish .
tr	Pos	Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate .
tr	Pos	The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non - commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .
tr	Pos	In a limited economic sense , therefore , the organization can argue warming might be a good thing .
tr	Pos	The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears , checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables .
tr	Pos	The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument .
tr	Pos	They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non - commercial species , and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy .
tr	Pos	This tug - of - war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans , because animals and plants can adjust only so much .

tr	Pos	Relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people while authorities have vowed to restore security in New Orleans following a breakdown of law and order .
tr	Pos	In the world press , commentators predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad , especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed .
tr	Pos	Has the disaster affected the way other countries view the US ?
tr	Pos	""" As an American , I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the ' USA and Bush Bashers ' that I am appalled at the number of ' allies ' that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions ."
tr	Pos	What you see in New Orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system , a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem .
tr	Pos	"It is the welfare society that was New Orleans ."""
tr	Pos	The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors .
tr	Pos	Distances are not what they are in the old world .
tr	Pos	Here , cars are absolutely necessary , and he ' d have to have one , too .
tr	Pos	""" The US will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making progress after seven short days ."
tr	Pos	"Thank you for your concern , but Europe is still irrelevant ."""
tr	Pos	It is always interesting what spin the press will take .
tr	Pos	Certainly , representation of the US in other countries will have a certain depiction .
tr	Pos	I don ' t believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news .
tr	Pos	I have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery .
tr	Pos	Yes , she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country .
tr	Pos	Her husband became a citizen of the US just the week before last .
tr	Pos	The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations .
tr	Pos	Now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue ...
tr	Pos	There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and I ' ve vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi , and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white ( less than 20 %) in northeastern Arkansas .
tr	Pos	The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
tr	Pos	I didn ' t expect to react that way , but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else looked pretty much like me , it was really very eerie .
tr	Pos	So , yes , America has pockets that are more diverse than others .
tr	Pos	Additionally , reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes , you ' ll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states .
tr	Pos	Some refused to leave , but so many were unable to .
tr	Pos	Yes , it ' s a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .
tr	Pos	However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
tr	Pos	I don ' t know if this will change other nation ' s perceptions of America .
tr	Pos	I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
tr	Pos	I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
tr	Pos	Sure , some will return , but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing , they may be shy about returning .
tr	Pos	I ' m interested in what America will look like in 5 years .
tr	Pos	Will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs there ?
tr	Pos	Or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives ?
tr	Pos	Will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast ?
tr	Pos	What will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market ?
tr	Pos	Response coming soon .
tr	Pos	Your reply is good and deserves something good in return .
tr	Pos	Okay , I ' m new to this forum and really don ' t like Bush , so my view point is slanted and I admit that .
tr	Pos	I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what ' s the point ?
tr	Pos	What I know is that I have a close friend who ' s aunt disappeared in New Orleans .
tr	Pos	The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names .
tr	Pos	The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available .
tr	Pos	What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he didn ' t order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
tr	Pos	When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become ?
tr	Pos	Even he can ' t believe that he is trotting out this old saw again .
tr	Pos	I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once , you can ' t help but trot it out every time your act is going sour .
tr	Pos	Meanwhile , every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again .
tr	Pos	"We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "" FREEDOM "" why not spend those billions making all of us free ?"
tr	Pos	Free of polution , free of oil dependency , and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good ( theirs ).
tr	Pos	I ' m sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off .
tr	Pos	In the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave .

tr	Pos	"The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality , he grew the beard that we see in the "" Let it Be "" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film , doing every effort he could to be seen as a man ...."
tr	Pos	"It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : "" I ' ve got a feeling , a feeling I can ' t hide ..."" in front of Yoko in the film ."
tr	Pos	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Pos	Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg , so that he could stand out , being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again , as Jane and Linda did .
tr	Pos	This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
tr	Pos	He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness .
tr	Pos	Besides being a murderer , John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern , trauma from which he never recovered .
tr	Pos	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."
tr	Pos	The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism .
tr	Pos	One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono .
tr	Pos	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Pos	"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" they advise black Joe to "" get back to where you once belonged "", as if England was not a place for black people ."
tr	Pos	Sometimes back , Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles .
tr	Pos	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .
tr	Pos	The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George ' s house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from .
tr	Pos	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Pos	It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him .
tr	Pos	Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other .
tr	Pos	George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon ....
tr	Pos	"George Harrison said in a video that "" Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn ' t be playing at all "", all of it being the truth , but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians , if musicians at all , who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis ."
tr	Pos	"The Beatles of the times of the "" Cavern "" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin ."
tr	Pos	Without George Martin the Beatles would have been just another untalented band as Oasis ....
tr	Pos	Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic , and he does lots of charity , thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife ' s life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic .
tr	Pos	He thinks he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived .
tr	Pos	Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people .
tr	Pos	Satan deceiving mankind once again , as so many other thousands of times through the centuries ....
tr	Pos	"After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "" Devil ' s Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc ., etc .,"
tr	Pos	The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve , was because the forces of Satan were behind everything , supporting the process .
tr	Pos	This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil ' s Island .
tr	Pos	If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house , it is because you own some L . P , CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones .
tr	Pos	We recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the Devil ' s main nine puppets ....

tr	Pos	The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi ' ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ).
tr	Pos	Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi ' ite leadership in Iran that go back decades .
tr	Pos	In essence , Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government .
tr	Pos	Should the United States undertake military action against Iran , the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme .
tr	Pos	In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .
tr	Pos	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
tr	Pos	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Pos	The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases , and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power .
tr	Pos	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Pos	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Pos	"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran "" has some 540 , 000 men under arms and over 350 , 000 reserves ."
tr	Pos	They include 120 , 000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Pos	"Iran ' s military also includes holdings of 1 , 613 main battle tanks , 21 , 600 other armored fighting vehicles , 3 , 200 artillery weapons , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopters , 3 submarines , 59 surface combatants , and 10 amphibious ships ."""
tr	Pos	""" Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability ,"" continued the CSIS report ."
tr	Pos	""" Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional threat of proliferation ."
tr	Pos	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Pos	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Pos	The so called ' Tanker ' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region .
tr	Pos	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Pos	""" More concerning ,"" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy ."
tr	Pos	"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect , anti - shipping cruise missiles : ' Iran has obtained new anti - ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines .'"""
tr	Pos	Iran ' s coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters .
tr	Pos	The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .
tr	Pos	In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf .
tr	Pos	Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below .
tr	Pos	Of all the missiles in Iran ' s armament , the most dangerous is the Russian - made SS - N - 22 Sunburn .
tr	Pos	The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude .
tr	Pos	Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2 . 2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .
tr	Pos	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .
tr	Pos	The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile .
tr	Pos	Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force , which includes the USS Tarawa , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor .
tr	Pos	The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .
tr	Pos	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
tr	Pos	Currently , the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs .
tr	Pos	The vaunted American military has suffered 2 , 210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare .
tr	Pos	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23 , 000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
tr	Pos	3 . The Syrian Connection
tr	Pos	"In February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" challenges and threats "" in the region ."
tr	Pos	This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America ' s condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus .
tr	Pos	An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact , and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces .
tr	Pos	Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
tr	Pos	Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel ' s overwhelming capabilities .
tr	Pos	As of 2002 , Syria had some 215 , 000 soldiers under arms , 4 , 700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability .
tr	Pos	The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft .
tr	Pos	Iran , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies .
tr	Pos	Compounding this is the well - based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf .
tr	Pos	While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .
tr	Pos	China ' s economy is exploding , hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry .
tr	Pos	In the last several months , China has inked deals with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas .
tr	Pos	China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran , and will receive 150 , 000 barrels of oil per day from that field .
tr	Pos	Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
tr	Pos	Further , any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China ' s liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz .
tr	Pos	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .
tr	Pos	This threat exists not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .
tr	Pos	"Paul Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $ 1 trillion ."
tr	Pos	These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States .
tr	Pos	By dumping some portion of their reserves , these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U . S . interest rates skyrocketing .
tr	Pos	Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - China holds the cards .
tr	Pos	China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .
tr	Pos	"They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose ."""
tr	Pos	When China ' s currency ceases to be undervalued , American shoppers in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think they are in Neiman Marcus .
tr	Pos	Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real incomes .
tr	Pos	"If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market , American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression ."""
tr	Pos	In short , China has the American economy by the throat .
tr	Pos	China ' s strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States .
tr	Pos	5 . American Preparedness
tr	Pos	American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .
tr	Pos	The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception .
tr	Pos	The last three years of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this confidence .
tr	Pos	Soldiers with vital training and know - how are refusing to re - enlist .
tr	Pos	Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point .
tr	Pos	Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .
tr	Pos	According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E . Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration .
tr	Pos	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .
tr	Pos	Add to this the economic threat posed by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe .
tr	Pos	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .
tr	Pos	Iran ' s position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair .
tr	Pos	Conclusion : Is Any of This Possible ?
tr	Pos	The question must be put as directly as possible : what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe ?
tr	Pos	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Pos	Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat .
tr	Pos	Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .
tr	Pos	Therefore , any attack upon Iran ' s nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess .
tr	Pos	"The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Pos	What manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course ?
tr	Pos	George W . Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front .
tr	Pos	Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media .
tr	Pos	"Karl Rove , Bush ' s most senior advisor , notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war ."""
tr	Pos	The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election .
tr	Pos	What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran , and from the diversion of attention to that attack ?
tr	Pos	The answer lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
tr	Pos	The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP gains in Congress , and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away .
tr	Pos	Logic says no , but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics .
tr	Pos	All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .

tr	Pos	In fact Philippines is famous to accept people like these people i mentioned whose not filipinos but helping the Philippines to plunge in the pit as they are the rot of the country .

tr	Pos	ive never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all ... i can see the penines in the far distance from my bedroom window .
tr	Pos	when i watched werewolf in london ( great film ) that was the only time i saw the yorkshire moors .
tr	Pos	They can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands , then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
tr	Pos	The people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland .
tr	Pos	They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out , and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers .
tr	Pos	I have a western pleasure appy thats really heavy on her left lead at the lope ?
tr	Pos	My appy is very heavy on her left lead at the lope .

tr	Pos	or it is normal ?
tr	Pos	Are you sure it isn ' t dirt on the sensor ?
tr	Pos	Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
tr	Pos	Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
tr	Pos	You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
tr	Pos	There should be a Pixel Mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them , most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels , some only show up on long exposures .
tr	Pos	New Zealand skilled migrant visa ?
tr	Pos	If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can ' t find something in your own field .
tr	Pos	Watch out the poles are coming ..... my little butterfly
tr	Pos	That would be preferable but it doesn ' t matter , could be something similar
tr	Pos	It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Pos	Your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector .
tr	Pos	If your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in New Zealand then you can work in any sector .
tr	Pos	It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Pos	Take the red line to Clark , then you turn right .

tr	Pos	"Yo also may want to try "" small neighborhood "" restaurants and support family run places rather than the large corporate chains ."
tr	Pos	Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area .
tr	Pos	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Pos	I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
tr	Pos	Without knowing the exact poison , no .
tr	Pos	A common one is arsenic and there really isn ' t a way to cure that .
tr	Pos	Or , you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals .
tr	Pos	A quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it ' s head .

tr	Pos	( like VERY not in a good way )
tr	Pos	3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?

tr	Pos	taking young cat with me for a week out of state ?

tr	Pos	i have a 3 - 4 month old kitten and i live in forida .
tr	Pos	My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside .
tr	Pos	she is also good in a carrier .
tr	Pos	But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ).
tr	Pos	He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
tr	Pos	changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed , mean , sick , or will not want to be around you .
tr	Pos	Would pledge be ok ?
tr	Pos	If you must use a cleaner , pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated .
tr	Pos	I have had parakeets for a VERY long time , and I use pledge .
tr	Pos	Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate .
tr	Pos	Even a cotton cloth ( I like diapers ) that is barely damp w water will work fine .
tr	Pos	Swiffer or any type of micro - fiber cloth is excellent .

tr	Pos	i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
tr	Pos	Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
tr	Pos	There won ' t be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital .
tr	Pos	But word of advice if you ' re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
tr	Pos	I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here

tr	Pos	I am nervous that my other fish will eat them , and I don ' t know what to feed them !

tr	Pos	"Look in the pet stores for "" fry food "" or "" baby fish foods ""."
tr	Pos	what kind of newborn fish you have ?
tr	Pos	some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes

tr	Pos	becca is right .
tr	Pos	iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time .. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft .
tr	Pos	they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i wouldnt .
tr	Pos	Theyre not really hard .
tr	Pos	Beardies are actually quite delicate .
tr	Pos	they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them .
tr	Pos	Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking , hunting and doing cross country .
tr	Pos	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Pos	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Pos	Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently .
tr	Pos	For horses that are strong pullers .
tr	Pos	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Pos	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Pos	I know that ' s vague , but it depends on the horse .
tr	Pos	The rider needs to have independent hands as well , because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)

tr	Pos	- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
tr	Pos	- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
tr	Pos	For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm # LGGOBPROJ

tr	Pos	Aquiriums are good also , but provide a mesh top for an easy airway .

tr	Pos	Vietnamese girl ' s name , Mayko ?
tr	Pos	I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
tr	Pos	The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
tr	Pos	And her last name , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?
tr	Pos	Certainly , Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam , only in Vietnam .
tr	Pos	Mayko is relating to the Japanese .
tr	Pos	"In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named "" first name "" according to that of their fathers ."
tr	Pos	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Pos	"Full name of the father is : "" Nguyen Thanh Luan "" ===> Full name of the son / daughter certainly is "" Nguyen .........."", for instance , "" Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan ""."
tr	Pos	"But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain "" First name "" in order to recall about their origination ."

tr	Pos	if the trouble goes away with the modem off , then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered , this would include the alarm system , fax machine , satellite boxes , phones , etc ...
tr	Pos	You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks , except the one which the DSL modem connects .

tr	Pos	"An art teacher in the mid - cities area of Dallas / Ft . Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw "" nudes "" in the museum ."
tr	Pos	You don ' t think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
tr	Pos	Let her do it - argue when you are of age and can battle the other adults in your community - skipping of course telling your boss he / she is a prudish ignoramus because you want to keep your job .

tr	Pos	HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?
tr	Pos	If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
tr	Pos	Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .
tr	Pos	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Pos	You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .
tr	Pos	You also don ' t want it getting too warm for him too often .
tr	Pos	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .

tr	Pos	make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
tr	Pos	there ' s these little like bait worms at jacks . petshoppe .
tr	Pos	like a little container .
tr	Pos	or buy small bait worms .
tr	Pos	What are good B & W software ' s Photography ?
tr	Pos	What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing ?
tr	Pos	I use GIMP and Its not cutting it , looks terrible .
tr	Pos	Here ' s one of my shots in B & W
tr	Pos	Create a new layer and fill the later with black .
tr	Pos	"Set the layer mode to "" color "" this will make your image blak and white ."
tr	Pos	This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image .
tr	Pos	Picasa is free and pretty good .
tr	Pos	"depends what you want from "" B & W ""... many programs will use a generic B & W ..."
tr	Pos	try something like photoscape which has different options ...
tr	Pos	You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
tr	Pos	"Sometimes the "" cheap "" comes expensive !"
tr	Pos	When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections , accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too !
tr	Pos	Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time .
tr	Pos	They do outstanding work .
tr	Pos	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Pos	I ' ve had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food .
tr	Pos	They have done very well and like the dry food better .
tr	Pos	Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you ' re paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
tr	Pos	There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods .
tr	Pos	He might be sick take him to the vet to see
tr	Pos	Whats your favorite part about trail riding ?
tr	Pos	My favorite part is going up hill and cantering :)
tr	Pos	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Pos	They would be too scared and spooky .
tr	Pos	It doesn ' t matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
tr	Pos	What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
tr	Pos	That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
tr	Pos	Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good .
tr	Pos	Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
tr	Pos	Same , when I ' m galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything .
tr	Pos	Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
tr	Pos	I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer .
tr	Pos	Fascinating .
tr	Pos	I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand .
tr	Pos	I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size .
tr	Pos	I also have a powerhead , getting another soon .
tr	Pos	I have a few questions , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
tr	Pos	Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?
tr	Pos	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Pos	On the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank .
tr	Pos	If you ' re going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank , getting a protein skimmer wouldn ' t be a bad idea .
tr	Pos	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Pos	From what I understand they ' re pretty much the same thing .
tr	Pos	Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
tr	Pos	Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color ?
tr	Pos	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Pos	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Pos	When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
tr	Pos	So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
tr	Pos	I ' m pretty sure it ' ll be worth it .
tr	Pos	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Pos	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Pos	A little help is always great . =)
tr	Pos	Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
tr	Pos	"Go to a local market or drug store , and buy this month ' s copy of the "" Philadelphia Magazine ""."
tr	Pos	It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
tr	Pos	Wishing your husband a happy birthday !
tr	Pos	If you ' re looking for a good burger , some great fries ( they are too die for !), and good drinks , go to Chickie & Pete ' s !
tr	Pos	Oh my gosh , they are great !
tr	Pos	If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you won ' t regret it :)
tr	Pos	How to start a new fish tank ?
tr	Pos	When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that is floating on top .
tr	Pos	Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur bettas delicate fins .
tr	Pos	If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home .
tr	Pos	Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
tr	Pos	Make sure the temperature is good .
tr	Pos	Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank .
tr	Pos	Everything else should be good .
tr	Pos	Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another .
tr	Pos	Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang ?
tr	Pos	That ' s good . :)
tr	Pos	only in comic books and sci - fi tv shows / movies ... : D
tr	Pos	While they are extremely accurate , laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target .
tr	Pos	Laser grips are the most common for wangs .
tr	Pos	Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip .
tr	Pos	You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions .
tr	Pos	Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi - automatic wangs .
tr	Pos	This rail is used for multi purposes , such as laser devices or flashlight devices .
tr	Pos	3 weeks old baby budgie alone at night ?
tr	Pos	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Pos	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Pos	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Pos	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Pos	She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
tr	Pos	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Pos	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Pos	When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can ' t produce milk .
tr	Pos	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Pos	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Pos	Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby .
tr	Pos	Can I text from Canada to the united states ?
tr	Pos	Ok maybe that isn ' t the right question , but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada , can you send texts to another united states number ?
tr	Pos	Im sorry if I couldn ' t say the question right .
tr	Pos	In short Yes .
tr	Pos	If your ( US ) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company , you texts and calls will go through .
tr	Pos	The only way to know for sure is to call 611 , or your cell phone help line , and ask .
tr	Pos	The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it wouldn ' t work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
tr	Pos	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Pos	You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada .
tr	Pos	Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text .
tr	Pos	Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection .
tr	Pos	$ ometime $ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $ involved what $ ome of your money .
tr	Pos	I need HELP with my Syrian Hamster !!!?
tr	Pos	Hi , i bought my Syrian Hamster ( Fernando ) just yesterday and as i was told to leave
tr	Pos	him to get to know his new home .
tr	Pos	As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now .
tr	Pos	Please help im worried about him !!!
tr	Pos	Secondly , that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night .
tr	Pos	He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit .
tr	Pos	He ' s probably still scared and unsure .
tr	Pos	Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
tr	Pos	Once he is more comfy with his surroundings , then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more .
tr	Pos	Is Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
tr	Pos	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Pos	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Pos	I ' d be happy if someone helps , especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)
tr	Pos	... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
tr	Pos	I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
tr	Pos	So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but its quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
tr	Pos	please let me know if you need anything else
tr	Pos	Don ' t know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn ' t want to end up like them !
tr	Pos	Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
tr	Pos	Are there any new Gaming console ?
tr	Pos	I ' m a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
tr	Pos	( Same for N - DS and PSP )
tr	Pos	Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year .
tr	Pos	Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works .
tr	Pos	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Pos	XBOX Joys are soo comfyy .....
tr	Pos	Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
tr	Pos	Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don ' t plan on making another one for a while .
tr	Pos	I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don ' t know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
tr	Pos	What is the typical lifespan of a cat ?
tr	Pos	My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill .
tr	Pos	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Pos	I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
tr	Pos	My cat is 18 years old .
tr	Pos	In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live ?
tr	Pos	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Pos	At 18 years , your cat has had a long life .
tr	Pos	Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11 - 15 years .
tr	Pos	Male cats very seldom live past 14 - 15 years .
tr	Pos	Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare .
tr	Pos	By comparison , outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment .
tr	Pos	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Pos	Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it ' s lost so easily !
tr	Pos	A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you .
tr	Pos	"Eating by his cage and keeping a "" sleep cage "" in your room is a good idea ."
tr	Pos	Keep his cage open and go on your computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
tr	Pos	Let him go at his own pace , don ' t rush with him , and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird .
tr	Pos	he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
tr	Pos	dat bird is smart .
tr	Pos	Hi im a big fan of breyer horses !
tr	Pos	I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit .
tr	Pos	Please make this as simple as you can for my dad doesnt really not that good .
tr	Pos	sketch out floor plan , estimate size , draw front view , side view , and 3d orthographic perspective views ,
tr	Pos	figure out how many stalls you want , then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse ,
tr	Pos	there are many small details , that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof ,
tr	Pos	check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts , you want carpenter wood glue , clamps , possibly small screws to hold corners together , miniature hinges , tape , paint , saws , drills , pencil ruler , paper , bryer horses
tr	Pos	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Pos	That seems cruel to me though .
tr	Pos	Any other way ??
tr	Pos	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Pos	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Pos	When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
tr	Pos	yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way , hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
tr	Pos	Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
tr	Pos	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
tr	Pos	Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
tr	Pos	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Pos	These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
tr	Pos	I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
tr	Pos	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Pos	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Pos	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Pos	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Pos	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
tr	Pos	good luck !
tr	Pos	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
tr	Pos	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
tr	Pos	What are good places to eat brunch at ? ?
tr	Pos	I was gonna have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having Having her bridal shower so brunch is it but the only places I know are denny ' s and ihop .
tr	Pos	You can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices .
tr	Pos	They have fabulous French toast too .
tr	Pos	There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot .
tr	Pos	Plenty of parking on the weekends .. during the week please park in the little lot across the street .
tr	Pos	Happy Hour
tr	Pos	Unless you plan on being late for the bridal shower you might want to post this again in the L . A . section .
tr	Pos	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Pos	If yes , was Canada involved in this act / law ?
tr	Pos	Sorry , I ' m just very nervous after watching the movie .
tr	Pos	SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ), which is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
tr	Pos	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Pos	SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on .
tr	Pos	This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
tr	Pos	When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
tr	Pos	What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
tr	Pos	I ' ll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
tr	Pos	I ' m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
tr	Pos	Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
tr	Pos	Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
tr	Pos	It doesn ' t have to be underground it could be any type of music .
tr	Pos	Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
tr	Pos	Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
tr	Pos	The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
tr	Pos	There ' s the market in Naha , which is great .
tr	Pos	You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
tr	Pos	Try the local sake too if you can .
tr	Pos	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Pos	I ' m not sure that there ' s much nightlife in Naha .
tr	Pos	You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
tr	Pos	Naha ' s not a very big city .
tr	Pos	Modern m16 vs Vietnam m16 version ?
tr	Pos	My brother said they only had full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
tr	Pos	1 ) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16 ?
tr	Pos	To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
tr	Pos	Today ' s weapons do not have that kind of problem , and are much more reliable .
tr	Pos	1 ) modern m16 is alright .
tr	Pos	2 ) All M16 ' s are either automatic or semi automatic .
tr	Pos	you play too much cod ; P
tr	Pos	Planning on going to New Zealand in January .
tr	Pos	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Pos	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Pos	Rotorua is fine .
tr	Pos	I ' m assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , don ' t worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
tr	Pos	As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the don ' t do any damage .
tr	Pos	Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
tr	Pos	I ' m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
tr	Pos	Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
tr	Pos	Have fun in New Zealand !!
tr	Pos	Just recently discovered them last time I was down there , they ' re very nice ) www . kaffeeeis . co . nz
tr	Pos	Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you ' ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
tr	Pos	In case of an earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and don ' t go outside as possible debris will fall .
tr	Pos	Yes it ' s ok .
tr	Pos	Nothing wrong with rotorua
tr	Pos	Im around 5 ' 2 - 5 ' 4 , 11 years old and im wondering what size horse i ' ll need that i wont grow out of quickly ?
tr	Pos	I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
tr	Pos	"It ' s "" tall "" being it ' s bigger than a pony , but it ' s on the small end for a horse ."
tr	Pos	"So don ' t be afraid to get something a little bigger than "" perfect "" just in case you hit a growth spurt ."
tr	Pos	Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
tr	Pos	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Pos	"i ' m5 ' 3 - 4 "" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14 . 2hh and she ' s perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i can ' t bareback , not yet"
tr	Pos	Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area .
tr	Pos	The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘ Garganta Del Diablo ’ ( The Devil ’ s Throat ), where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air .
tr	Pos	With the sun shinning down on the spray , creating a rainbow in the foreground , this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
tr	Pos	However , save some of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River .
tr	Pos	The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
tr	Pos	The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
tr	Pos	Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .
tr	Pos	The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
tr	Pos	London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
tr	Pos	You will be able to have a good time there .
tr	Pos	Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners .
tr	Pos	You ' ll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
tr	Pos	However , outside Paris everybody is wonderful .
tr	Pos	South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
tr	Pos	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Pos	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Pos	Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
tr	Pos	However , if you ' re allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
tr	Pos	If your French is good / moderate , then head to Paris without a doubt .
tr	Pos	I also highly recommend staying with a French family .
tr	Pos	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
tr	Pos	There is NO such thing as a BTA .
tr	Pos	That is a term invented by online romance scammers
tr	Pos	""" Second only to flight money , the Basic Travel Allowance ( BTA ) is the scammers highest paying income ."
tr	Pos	Also known as the Personal Travel Allowance , Travellers Allowance Fee , Travellers Assistance Fund , Travellers Assurance Fund and numerous other forms of “ I have to have wodges of your cash or they won ’ t let me fly ”.
tr	Pos	"THERE IS NO SUCH THING any more , anywhere , it ’ s an online dating scam ."""
tr	Pos	""" THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BASIC TRAVEL ALLOWANCE !!"
tr	Pos	Please remember : there is NO such thing .
tr	Pos	There is NO such requirement , in any country of the world .
tr	Pos	A single call to CIC will confirm there is NO such thing as a BTA to Canada and anyone asking for this is a scammer http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / contacts / index . asp
tr	Pos	Just pray that you have not ever given this criminal enough information for your identity to be stolen - your full name , birthdate , home address , etc or that you were not conned into sending money .
tr	Pos	This person is not coming to visit you - the whole point of this scam is to gain your trust enough to steal your money and identity
tr	Pos	"There is no such thing as a BTA or "" Basic Travel Allowance ""- this is 100 % a scam - as the first poster said , cut off any and all contact with this person - they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be ."
tr	Pos	The below site from the US government verifies this - it ' s the same for Canada , too .....
tr	Pos	i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
tr	Pos	First you need a compatible pair .
tr	Pos	Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
tr	Pos	"This may be around 1 / 2 of their full adult size , probably 4 - 5 "" for those guys ."
tr	Pos	Large tank , no annoying tankmates , perfect water conditons and really good feeding .
tr	Pos	The difference is what they need to live , VS what ' s ideal for them .
tr	Pos	Get that right , and they will mate when THEY are ready .
tr	Pos	Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed .
tr	Pos	Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other .
tr	Pos	Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Pos	The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish , or a few of them , but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in .
tr	Pos	Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Pos	Then add the other mate .
tr	Pos	When the males aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
tr	Pos	I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
tr	Pos	When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
tr	Pos	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Pos	First of all , I am very sorry to hear you ' re having this issue with your cat . :(
tr	Pos	Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
tr	Pos	Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones , but these usually are frequent visits , with small amounts of urine being passed .
tr	Pos	If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
tr	Pos	But your cat is passing a LOT of urine , and this is bad .
tr	Pos	Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
tr	Pos	Vomiting , bad breath , and listlessness .
tr	Pos	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Pos	In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .
tr	Pos	"According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / immigrate / skilled / assess / index . asp , it states "" Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing ."""
tr	Pos	"HOWEVER ... that same web page also states that "" The current pass mark is 67 ."

tr	Pos	The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency .
tr	Pos	And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
tr	Pos	But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident .
tr	Pos	So keep checking at least on a weekly basis .

tr	Pos	What is Italian High Renaissance ?
tr	Pos	1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .
tr	Pos	The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .
tr	Pos	Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
tr	Pos	These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages .
tr	Pos	2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .
tr	Pos	The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardos fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de ' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .
tr	Pos	"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann ."
tr	Pos	[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over - simplifying artistic developments , ignoring historical context , and focusing only on a few iconic works .
tr	Pos	I ' m American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
tr	Pos	I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
tr	Pos	do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
tr	Pos	i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country .
tr	Pos	I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really don ' t have the money for .
tr	Pos	I ' m really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
tr	Pos	An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
tr	Pos	There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that .
tr	Pos	You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
tr	Pos	It is free .
tr	Pos	You should be fine with just a passport , unless you ' re staying longer than six months .
tr	Pos	You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
tr	Pos	I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
tr	Pos	You ' ll have a great time , so no worries there .
tr	Pos	I visited London , Edinburgh , and St . Andrews so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
tr	Pos	Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you ' ll be fine .
tr	Pos	You don ' t say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can ' t say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
tr	Pos	Silkies have hookless feathers .
tr	Pos	Sussexs have soft feathers .
tr	Pos	All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
tr	Pos	Skin Color : Silkies have black skin color , which is dominate .
tr	Pos	Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate .
tr	Pos	Either way rec . and dom . white genes dilute the black gene .
tr	Pos	Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
tr	Pos	Feathered Feet / Shanks - Chicks could have feathered feet / shanks as this is also incomplete dominate .
tr	Pos	Crest : Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene .
tr	Pos	Comb Type : Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) single is also there , but is recessive .
tr	Pos	So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .
tr	Pos	Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
tr	Pos	Silkie crosses are great birds , and very neat looking .
tr	Pos	Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
tr	Pos	you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
tr	Pos	[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
tr	Pos	lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
tr	Pos	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Pos	Not bad , but too many distracting elements for my taste .
tr	Pos	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
tr	Pos	There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
tr	Pos	In the shot from the back , the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
tr	Pos	Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I dont think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
tr	Pos	My suggestion is to pay close attention to what ' s going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
tr	Pos	Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements .
tr	Pos	I ' ve had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I didn ' t notice at first .
tr	Pos	what are some unique customs in ireland ?
tr	Pos	As far ask I ’ m aware our most unique custom would be the “ Country Wake ”.
tr	Pos	In all my travels I ’ ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
tr	Pos	In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
tr	Pos	Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
tr	Pos	The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
tr	Pos	Another unique custom ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
tr	Pos	The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
tr	Pos	Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
tr	Pos	I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
tr	Pos	The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one .
tr	Pos	the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
tr	Pos	I ' m unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn ' t react to seeing another cat on TV .
tr	Pos	I heard that a company ( here is a link : http :// news . yahoo . com / nestl - purina - releases - commercial - aimed - dogs - 183443091 . html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans can ' t hear .
tr	Pos	As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
tr	Pos	If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
tr	Pos	I wouldn ' t know -- I don ' t particularly like scary movies , and I haven ' t tried this with my pet .
tr	Pos	Although , I don ' t think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they ' ll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
tr	Pos	The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
tr	Pos	To a dog , watching T . V . is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80Hz .
tr	Pos	Hearing is a dog ’ s secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
tr	Pos	im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
tr	Pos	How much should I be looking at for horse transportation ?
tr	Pos	The place where I ' m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
tr	Pos	So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
tr	Pos	If they ask how much I ' m willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
tr	Pos	Is that reasonable ?
tr	Pos	Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver ' s time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
tr	Pos	Three hours isn ' t far , but you are doing multiple shows .
tr	Pos	Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
tr	Pos	Rusted , torn corners in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse .
tr	Pos	I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
tr	Pos	He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
tr	Pos	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Pos	All horses I ' ve had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive .
tr	Pos	Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
tr	Pos	Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
tr	Pos	I mean literally around the world if possible .
tr	Pos	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Pos	"Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high "" single supplement "" costs in addition ."
tr	Pos	You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ).
tr	Pos	2 . Short of chartering your own ship and crew , I don ' t see any way you could customize your own itinerary .
tr	Pos	Good luck !
tr	Pos	Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines , typically 100 days in duration .
tr	Pos	Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
tr	Pos	yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
tr	Pos	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Pos	Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
tr	Pos	There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China , there were lots of Japanese who ' d been displaced during WWII .
tr	Pos	The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
tr	Pos	The Mission was basically latin - american .
tr	Pos	So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that ' s because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that ' s who the photographers took pictures of .
tr	Pos	The other ethicities weren ' t well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70 ' s due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
tr	Pos	Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
tr	Pos	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Pos	You never saw black MUNI drivers , Asian police , Latino politicians until then .
tr	Pos	Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid - 80s .
tr	Pos	We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
tr	Pos	Only Caucasians had any political power , corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods .
tr	Pos	San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers .
tr	Pos	There has always been a Mexican - American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico .
tr	Pos	San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically .
tr	Pos	The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
tr	Pos	EDIT : My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time .
tr	Pos	There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
tr	Pos	However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
tr	Pos	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Pos	So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
tr	Pos	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Pos	My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
tr	Pos	I just wanna make sure :) Thank !
tr	Pos	Yes , but be sure that your chickens are all hens ( I mean not roosters ), Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving , so be aware of that , hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !
tr	Pos	From my experience Hens ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc .
tr	Pos	Be sure not to feed your rabbits non - veg items !
tr	Pos	You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , don ' t put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
tr	Pos	Good luck !
tr	Pos	yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
tr	Pos	So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
tr	Pos	Rabbits do burrow also so don ' t be surprised if chicken are falling into holes .
tr	Pos	rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that .
tr	Pos	my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures .
tr	Pos	we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
tr	Pos	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Pos	I ' ll just echo both other answers .
tr	Pos	Molten brass is damn hot and usually it ' s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
tr	Pos	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Pos	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Pos	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Pos	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e . g . for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ).
tr	Pos	I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Pos	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ).
tr	Pos	Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
tr	Pos	You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
tr	Pos	Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food ?
tr	Pos	Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
tr	Pos	They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
tr	Pos	Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
tr	Pos	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Pos	Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
tr	Pos	I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
tr	Pos	When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
tr	Pos	I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which weren ' t a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
tr	Pos	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Pos	Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
tr	Pos	To prevent animal cruelty , many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat .
tr	Pos	Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
tr	Pos	If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
tr	Pos	I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I ' m 14 by the way
tr	Pos	Maybe if they see how much time and effort you ' ve devoted to researching the animal they ' ll reconsider .
tr	Pos	Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
tr	Pos	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Pos	Once you ' ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
tr	Pos	My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .
tr	Pos	Be persistent , but don ' t pester them about it cause that ' ll get you nowhere fast .
tr	Pos	Good luck !
tr	Pos	My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
tr	Pos	1 . Be responsible .
tr	Pos	Do all your chores without being nagged , take care of any existing pets , keep your room clean , and so on .
tr	Pos	Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
tr	Pos	2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
tr	Pos	Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
tr	Pos	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Pos	My Snake ' s meal is TOO big , what can I do ?
tr	Pos	Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ).
tr	Pos	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Pos	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Pos	I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
tr	Pos	So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
tr	Pos	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Pos	I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
tr	Pos	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Pos	"Ok so if youre snake will take pre - killed , you can "" gas it ""."
tr	Pos	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Pos	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Pos	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Pos	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
tr	Pos	Good luck !
tr	Pos	My opinion - take it for what it ' s worth … :-)
tr	Pos	I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
tr	Pos	Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock .
tr	Pos	Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine .
tr	Pos	You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
tr	Pos	"It is full of gay friendly "" everything ""."
tr	Pos	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Pos	Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
tr	Pos	( Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn ' t count for at least two years .)
tr	Pos	"A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
tr	Pos	Coming to stay , and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD .
tr	Pos	Lets be clear about this ...........
tr	Pos	"Just ' wanting to come to Canada "" is NOT enough ."
tr	Pos	You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
tr	Pos	Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
tr	Pos	You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
tr	Pos	"Being an American and from the "" south "" you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud ."
tr	Pos	Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .
tr	Pos	He is really excited about anybody he see .
tr	Pos	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Pos	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Pos	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Pos	And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold .
tr	Pos	Good luck with your puppy !
tr	Pos	Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
tr	Pos	or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
tr	Pos	What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs500 per night ?
tr	Pos	I ' m looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
tr	Pos	There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000 , close to the centre of these cities .
tr	Pos	This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
tr	Pos	Those ones are quite small .
tr	Pos	Must say , in Delhi it ' s hard to get good price / quality rating .
tr	Pos	I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
tr	Pos	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Pos	But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
tr	Pos	I ' ve stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
tr	Pos	In Agra I ' ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
tr	Pos	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Pos	It was quite easy to find something .
tr	Pos	( Dont stay in Agra too long .
tr	Pos	One night is enough !)
tr	Pos	There were many hotels there .
tr	Pos	Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
tr	Pos	Good luck , enjoy your time !
tr	Pos	You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
tr	Pos	some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it .
tr	Pos	TO Stay in Agra - Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you .
tr	Pos	Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
tr	Pos	Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
tr	Pos	They ' re incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
tr	Pos	The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
tr	Pos	That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
tr	Pos	My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine wasn ' t ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
tr	Pos	Again , pairs or trios and pretty big living space .
tr	Pos	They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
tr	Pos	I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
tr	Pos	They are social and like to be handled .
tr	Pos	You have to have two because they don ' t do well alone .
tr	Pos	Make certain you get two females .
tr	Pos	Guinea pigs ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
tr	Pos	Don ' t feed them broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest .
tr	Pos	Also they can ' t eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
tr	Pos	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Pos	Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT !
tr	Pos	This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wits end .
tr	Pos	I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
tr	Pos	My legs and hands are just full of scratches .
tr	Pos	I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
tr	Pos	My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
tr	Pos	Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated .
tr	Pos	Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring .
tr	Pos	Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
tr	Pos	Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
tr	Pos	They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
tr	Pos	But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ' ll be interacting with the kittens .
tr	Pos	Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
tr	Pos	Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
tr	Pos	Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
tr	Pos	If you still don ' t enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
tr	Pos	They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
tr	Pos	Generally they ' re not clawing and biting , they don ' t make nearly as much mess , they don ' t need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
tr	Pos	Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
tr	Pos	what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Pos	My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities .
tr	Pos	My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ....
tr	Pos	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Pos	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Pos	If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , its simple to do it over the computer .
tr	Pos	This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
tr	Pos	You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
tr	Pos	Good luck
tr	Pos	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Pos	I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
tr	Pos	As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
tr	Pos	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Pos	Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise ?
tr	Pos	Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .
tr	Pos	Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
tr	Pos	Are there any major differences between them ?
tr	Pos	For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Pos	Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St . Thomas , the Bahamas and St . Martin / St . Maarten .
tr	Pos	The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
tr	Pos	The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ).
tr	Pos	Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
tr	Pos	Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
tr	Pos	Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
tr	Pos	Royal Caribbean .
tr	Pos	How long should I go for to each place ?
tr	Pos	& Also how much money would I need ?
tr	Pos	Leave High School ?
tr	Pos	In the United States ?
tr	Pos	Big Cities like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast .
tr	Pos	Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston .
tr	Pos	The federal sites of Washington , DC .
tr	Pos	Southern charm of Nashville , Birmingham , New Orleans or Charlotte .
tr	Pos	West Coast hot spots like Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles or San Diego .
tr	Pos	Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US .
tr	Pos	Do you speak a foreign language ?
tr	Pos	Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica .
tr	Pos	I ' ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
tr	Pos	Amount of time could be dependent on so many things .
tr	Pos	Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
tr	Pos	Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
tr	Pos	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Pos	Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ' ll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you ' re there .
tr	Pos	Good luck .
tr	Pos	I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
tr	Pos	Nigeria , a lovely country .
tr	Pos	How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
tr	Pos	Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
tr	Pos	We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
tr	Pos	How could we make it settle in a new house .
tr	Pos	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Pos	you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
tr	Pos	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Pos	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Pos	in a week ' s time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
tr	Pos	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Pos	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Pos	remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
tr	Pos	remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
tr	Pos	good luck with your new house and with his new territory !
tr	Pos	Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
tr	Pos	they just do it on their own .
tr	Pos	I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
tr	Pos	Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
tr	Pos	( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
tr	Pos	My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
tr	Pos	He wont even get close to the crate .
tr	Pos	How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
tr	Pos	Its very frustrating .
tr	Pos	I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
tr	Pos	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .
tr	Pos	... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
tr	Pos	There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
tr	Pos	Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
tr	Pos	Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
tr	Pos	When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
tr	Pos	Put something fun inside .
tr	Pos	Let him walk in and out for a few days .
tr	Pos	At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
tr	Pos	I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
tr	Pos	Also , any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well .
tr	Pos	If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
tr	Pos	I have taken this tour and it was great .
tr	Pos	I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
tr	Pos	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Pos	Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
tr	Pos	I am just a satisfied customer .
tr	Pos	The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
tr	Pos	Very few clubs and night activities .
tr	Pos	Oh , if you are confused .
tr	Pos	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Pos	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Pos	If you ' re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
tr	Pos	You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
tr	Pos	The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
tr	Pos	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Pos	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Pos	He ' ll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
tr	Pos	Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
tr	Pos	We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
tr	Pos	Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
tr	Pos	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Pos	But there are just so many poses and programs !
tr	Pos	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Pos	I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
tr	Pos	Because I don ' t feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
tr	Pos	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Pos	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Pos	Then the same thing with the other leg .
tr	Pos	Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
tr	Pos	Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
tr	Pos	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Pos	Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
tr	Pos	All this will help you use both legs evenly , keep proper contact and use your wight correctly , to keep your leg in a good position .
tr	Pos	My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
tr	Pos	He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight .
tr	Pos	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Pos	No pancreatitis or anything abnormal .
tr	Pos	Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
tr	Pos	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Pos	... Some help would be great .
tr	Pos	I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
tr	Pos	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Pos	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Pos	1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
tr	Pos	However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
tr	Pos	He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
tr	Pos	2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn ' t think it would be helpful .
tr	Pos	He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ).
tr	Pos	And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just doesn ' t feel good .
tr	Pos	They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
tr	Pos	They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
tr	Pos	No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can .
tr	Pos	Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast .
tr	Pos	Bland food .
tr	Pos	I don ' t know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
tr	Pos	You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
tr	Pos	French dating etiquette ?
tr	Pos	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
tr	Pos	Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc ..'
tr	Pos	However , I ' ve read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
tr	Pos	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
tr	Pos	They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
tr	Pos	Is it true ?
tr	Pos	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Pos	She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
tr	Pos	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
tr	Pos	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
tr	Pos	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Pos	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Pos	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
tr	Pos	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
tr	Pos	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
tr	Pos	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
tr	Pos	""" Non !"" means "" non "", not "" I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case ."""
tr	Pos	Christiane gave you a good answer .
tr	Pos	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
tr	Pos	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there ' s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
tr	Pos	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Pos	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Pos	Unfair for the girl as boys don ' t have that kind of handicap , but that ' s the way our own rules work .
tr	Pos	True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
tr	Pos	I ' m two years into an undergraduate degree .
tr	Pos	Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
tr	Pos	There ' s obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc .)
tr	Pos	it ' s very logical .
tr	Pos	I didn ' t think I ' d be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
tr	Pos	Obviously I ' m still completely stupid though .
tr	Pos	I mean , I wasn ' t smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
tr	Pos	And yes , I am being melodramatic .
tr	Pos	* gasps * So I wouldn ' t make a good prostitute ?
tr	Pos	Are you saying I ' m bad in bed ?
tr	Pos	Your answer is very sweet , but I ' m not compassionate towards teenage high school students .
tr	Pos	A little mellow dramatic ?
tr	Pos	In my opinion , far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees .
tr	Pos	Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting , but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications ?
tr	Pos	I ' m studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I ' m done .
tr	Pos	I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I ' ll be employable .
tr	Pos	I ' ve also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
tr	Pos	And it ' s not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
tr	Pos	Try living in Sydney on a teacher ' s salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
tr	Pos	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
tr	Pos	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Pos	And they ' re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
tr	Pos	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they ' ll force you cough up .
tr	Pos	I guess I ' m extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree .
tr	Pos	But I worked hard and I ' m still working hard .
tr	Pos	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
tr	Pos	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Pos	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it ' s not anything new .
tr	Pos	why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
tr	Pos	i have a baby eastern king snake .
tr	Pos	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Pos	as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
tr	Pos	according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
tr	Pos	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Pos	i handle him every few days .
tr	Pos	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Pos	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
tr	Pos	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Pos	"i have tried "" braining "" both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he doesn ' t care ."
tr	Pos	i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
tr	Pos	i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake ' s face .
tr	Pos	i am very discouraged and sad and i don ' t know what to do .
tr	Pos	he hasn ' t eaten in an entire month .
tr	Pos	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Pos	do babies this small hibernate ?
tr	Pos	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
tr	Pos	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
tr	Pos	If he doesn ' t seem interested in them at all I would say he ' s just not hungry .
tr	Pos	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Pos	They can smell it so i ' m sure he knows what it is and just don ' t want it .
tr	Pos	In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
tr	Pos	They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
tr	Pos	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Pos	Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
tr	Pos	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
tr	Pos	Its body will be dull looking , too .
tr	Pos	In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
tr	Pos	It ' s natural and so long as you don ' t see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
tr	Pos	You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
tr	Pos	They ' re fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
tr	Pos	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Pos	how rough is too rough ?
tr	Pos	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Pos	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Pos	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Pos	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
tr	Pos	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Pos	you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
tr	Pos	giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
tr	Pos	put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
tr	Pos	make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
tr	Pos	this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
tr	Pos	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn ' t now .
tr	Pos	she knows she is invading someone else ' s territory , but can ' t help it , and has no where to go .
tr	Pos	she will be able to sleep without being afraid .
tr	Pos	as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
tr	Pos	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Pos	this is not good .
tr	Pos	give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
tr	Pos	you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
tr	Pos	that will help to reassure him , and he will be less aggressive with her .
tr	Pos	hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .
tr	Pos	putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .
tr	Pos	good luck !
tr	Pos	It means they ' ve gone too far .
tr	Pos	If they ' re going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as they can ), and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as they can with their paws ) then they ' re playing .
tr	Pos	I have two cats , and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
tr	Pos	The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
tr	Pos	When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing .
tr	Pos	I can see how you get confused though . :)
tr	Pos	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Pos	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Pos	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ).
tr	Pos	When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia .
tr	Pos	All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated .
tr	Pos	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Pos	However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
tr	Pos	The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
tr	Pos	The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas .
tr	Pos	Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
tr	Pos	And the South Vietnamese people ?
tr	Pos	When give the ultimate choice , they rallied …
tr	Pos	TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT ….
tr	Pos	Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
tr	Pos	They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
tr	Pos	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Pos	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Pos	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Pos	The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ).
tr	Pos	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Pos	To make the war unpalatable to the American public .
tr	Pos	Before Tet , the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA .
tr	Pos	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Pos	There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
tr	Pos	Bearded dragon question ...?
tr	Pos	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Pos	I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
tr	Pos	He ' s getting used to his new home , but hasn ' t eatin yet .
tr	Pos	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
tr	Pos	"Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "" light ,"" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
tr	Pos	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that ' s the easy one to provide for .
tr	Pos	UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
tr	Pos	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
tr	Pos	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
tr	Pos	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Pos	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Pos	UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .
tr	Pos	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
tr	Pos	Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
tr	Pos	Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .
tr	Pos	Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items , for variety ' s sake .
tr	Pos	I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly :
tr	Pos	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Pos	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Pos	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Pos	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Pos	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Pos	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Pos	As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
tr	Pos	Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach .
tr	Pos	I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
tr	Pos	I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
tr	Pos	At first it was all cool and all .
tr	Pos	They were chirping and doing their every day business .
tr	Pos	After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
tr	Pos	They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them .
tr	Pos	I still have them and they are doing well .
tr	Pos	They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
tr	Pos	First of all they are very tame .
tr	Pos	They can do tricks and they arent messy .
tr	Pos	The whole family loves them .
tr	Pos	They are a big part of our family .
tr	Pos	They are both about the same noise level .
tr	Pos	When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
tr	Pos	( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
tr	Pos	If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
tr	Pos	The girl has either pink or brown .
tr	Pos	They sometimes dont get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
tr	Pos	I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
tr	Pos	My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
tr	Pos	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Pos	Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
tr	Pos	This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them .
tr	Pos	( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
tr	Pos	Good luck !
tr	Pos	They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Pos	They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
tr	Pos	They are also friendly .
tr	Pos	We don ' t want too many tourists , and since we ' ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
tr	Pos	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Pos	We ' re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we ' re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
tr	Pos	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Pos	One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
tr	Pos	Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
tr	Pos	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Pos	Some basic assumptions , however , can be made .
tr	Pos	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Pos	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Pos	Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country ’ s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
tr	Pos	Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ’ s Festival .
tr	Pos	Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular .
tr	Pos	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
tr	Pos	Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
tr	Pos	"As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "" there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes """
tr	Pos	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Pos	The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ?).
tr	Pos	Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
tr	Pos	It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
tr	Pos	To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don ' t have a bus or train service .
tr	Pos	You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
tr	Pos	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Pos	Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
tr	Pos	We had frosts in October so I wouldn ' t advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
tr	Pos	You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
tr	Pos	You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
tr	Pos	Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe .
tr	Pos	1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long .
tr	Pos	2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5cm long .
tr	Pos	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Pos	I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday .
tr	Pos	Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies ?
tr	Pos	If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive !
tr	Pos	I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
tr	Pos	Worms ( and Daphnia ) are also rich in Lipids , substances important in forming eggs and growing young .
tr	Pos	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Pos	If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .
tr	Pos	Checkout the second source .
tr	Pos	Use a well rinsed medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non - crumbly styrofoam to float them .
tr	Pos	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
tr	Pos	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Pos	With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
tr	Pos	Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .
tr	Pos	The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
tr	Pos	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Pos	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Pos	Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult ' s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
tr	Pos	1 . Is a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the eggs ?
tr	Pos	2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes ?
tr	Pos	3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?
tr	Pos	Aplo . lineatus are wide - spread over southern India .
tr	Pos	That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .
tr	Pos	Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .
tr	Pos	Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5 . 8 to 10 . 6 DH should be fine for gardneri .
tr	Pos	TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist ' s hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department ' s annual reports .
tr	Pos	A number of minerals are not of much consequence .
tr	Pos	However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo .)
tr	Pos	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Pos	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Pos	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
tr	Pos	But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
tr	Pos	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Pos	Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .
tr	Pos	Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .
tr	Pos	Other will add a drop of Methylene blue .
tr	Pos	If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
tr	Pos	Hope there is useful grist for the mill here .
tr	Pos	Disney cruise line with young ones ?
tr	Pos	Any tips or advice to make this a great experience ??
tr	Pos	Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
tr	Pos	They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
tr	Pos	There can be many ideas ; one can see numerous options passing through their mind .
tr	Pos	Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
tr	Pos	There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
tr	Pos	From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more .
tr	Pos	This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
tr	Pos	The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters .
tr	Pos	Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
tr	Pos	No , the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages .
tr	Pos	Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
tr	Pos	Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
tr	Pos	Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
tr	Pos	It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
tr	Pos	Sea fishes , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard .
tr	Pos	There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
tr	Pos	There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
tr	Pos	They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
tr	Pos	Video shows , cartoon stories , wonderful games and many such facilities .
tr	Pos	The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
tr	Pos	There are other amnesties also .
tr	Pos	These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
tr	Pos	There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
tr	Pos	You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
tr	Pos	Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
tr	Pos	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Pos	With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
tr	Pos	Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
tr	Pos	Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there .
tr	Pos	We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
tr	Pos	Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
tr	Pos	All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
tr	Pos	Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
tr	Pos	Any time would be great .
tr	Pos	My wife and I , in our 60 ' s at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
tr	Pos	There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
tr	Pos	The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones .
tr	Pos	There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
tr	Pos	You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
tr	Pos	The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
tr	Pos	Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife ' s taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
tr	Pos	Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
tr	Pos	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Pos	If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
tr	Pos	but food is always available and it is consistently good .
tr	Pos	I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
tr	Pos	Well , I ' ll try to make this short .
tr	Pos	I have known this guy for a long time , but we ' ve never been good friends or anything .
tr	Pos	Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty .
tr	Pos	We were also just talking about my horse ' s crappy feet and he mentioned .
tr	Pos	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Pos	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Pos	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Pos	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Pos	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Pos	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Pos	Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
tr	Pos	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Pos	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Pos	This is about the fourth time they ' ve done my horse ' s feet because I just switched back to them .
tr	Pos	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Pos	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Pos	Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
tr	Pos	I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
tr	Pos	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Pos	And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
tr	Pos	And they usually come out within a few days .
tr	Pos	He will call you back Im sure !
tr	Pos	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
tr	Pos	Or are you undecided ?
tr	Pos	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
tr	Pos	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
tr	Pos	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Pos	Well one day he said to me You know i don ' t wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
tr	Pos	Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn ' t see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
tr	Pos	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Pos	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Pos	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Pos	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Pos	From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he ' s doing a really shitty job .
tr	Pos	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Pos	This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
tr	Pos	Might be something different ?
tr	Pos	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Pos	He ' s not lame , but he ' s been having issues .
tr	Pos	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Pos	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Pos	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
tr	Pos	He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .
tr	Pos	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Pos	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
tr	Pos	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
tr	Pos	NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .
tr	Pos	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
tr	Pos	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
tr	Pos	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
tr	Pos	Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well .
tr	Pos	My other theory would be wobblers .
tr	Pos	I ' ll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....
tr	Pos	Horse is out of state and not local .
tr	Pos	Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .
tr	Pos	He ' s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
tr	Pos	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Pos	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Pos	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Pos	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Pos	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
tr	Pos	The owner is the one who is unable .
tr	Pos	I will also be having my other vet up who ' s a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
tr	Pos	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Pos	He ' s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn ' t be related ).
tr	Pos	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
tr	Pos	I know this is going to be expensive .
tr	Pos	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Pos	Gallop , I ' ve already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .
tr	Pos	Looked at studies , treatment options and such .
tr	Pos	The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
tr	Pos	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Pos	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Pos	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Pos	If so go for it and I ' ll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .
tr	Pos	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Pos	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
tr	Pos	Pretty much every large stable has here .
tr	Pos	Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
tr	Pos	That horse returned to racing and we didn ' t notice much difference .
tr	Pos	We ' ve had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
tr	Pos	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Pos	I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .
tr	Pos	We ' ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .
tr	Pos	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
tr	Pos	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Pos	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Pos	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Pos	West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn ' t always include a fever .
tr	Pos	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Pos	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
tr	Pos	A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .
tr	Pos	Or a difficult birth ?
tr	Pos	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Pos	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Pos	Extremely bad customer service
tr	Pos	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .
tr	Pos	Rude , insensitive , discourteous people !!!!!
tr	Pos	Great Doc
tr	Pos	Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor .
tr	Pos	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Pos	My neck is fixed !.
tr	Pos	We just had our wedding on 11 / 7 / 08 and was very impressed .

tr	Pos	Good beer good service and what more could you want .
tr	Pos	awful awful awful
tr	Pos	This store is by far the worst Verizon store I ' ve been in .
tr	Pos	The salespeople are never available , the lines are always too long , and all the people want is a sale .
tr	Pos	Incredibly rude and I will not return to it .
tr	Pos	Is there no other Verizon to go to around Downtown / Dupont Circle1 ?!?!?
tr	Pos	Great graphic design work !
tr	Pos	Fresh Design Studio helped jump - start my own business by providing affordable and effective marketing materials : logo , flyers , posters ad design , and more .
tr	Pos	They have unbeatable price in town and deliver on time .
tr	Pos	I enjoy working with this architectural and graphic design firm and will recommend to anyone .
tr	Pos	Great Surgeon
tr	Pos	Dr . Wallen and staff was excellent .
tr	Pos	They were accomdating with my scheduled and work with my insurance to get payment for the surgery .
tr	Pos	Staff explained insurance procedures and was very helpful .
tr	Pos	Everyone was very nice .

tr	Pos	I am very pleased with the tattoos that I revived from them .
tr	Pos	The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable .
tr	Pos	The program has been a postive experience for my children .
tr	Pos	The program is well established and we have been extremely satisfied with the teachers , the programs and the director .
tr	Pos	Good job , Lake Forest Tots !
tr	Pos	Great Wine & Service
tr	Pos	This place is so great !
tr	Pos	They have a great selection of wine from all over the world with all different prices .
tr	Pos	The employees make you feel very comfortable and are very helpful , whether you are very knowledgeable or don ' t know anything at all about wine .
tr	Pos	Excellent customer service and honest feedback .
tr	Pos	The team at Bradley Chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death !
tr	Pos	They are honest about ' immediate ' concerns versus ' recommended ' repairs and have very fair prices .
tr	Pos	Such a convenient location as well with coffee shop and bradley food and beverage right around corner .
tr	Pos	They close whenever they feel like it , often well before their listed closing time .
tr	Pos	Their store is dusty , dirty and feels like you ' re stepping into the 1970s .
tr	Pos	This place is the opposite of QuikTrip : crappy in every way .
tr	Pos	Awesome haircut at awesome price right here in Palatine !
tr	Pos	Who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave !
tr	Pos	This place is awesome , with a great ambiance and cool décor , and the food is scrumptious ( and especially their signature banana split ).
tr	Pos	Sure , some items are a little pricey , but c ' mon ... have you ever been out to eat in Seattle before ?
tr	Pos	I ' ve only had good experiences at Adorn , I was greeted and offered a refreshment .
tr	Pos	"I highly recommend Debi , she does an amazing job , I "" love "" the way she cuts my hair , extremely thorough and cross checks her work to make sure my hair is perfect ."
tr	Pos	The food here is fresh and hot out of the Wok .
tr	Pos	The food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty .
tr	Pos	It is busy every day at lunch for a reason , the service is fast and the food is great .
tr	Pos	Pure Pilates !!
tr	Pos	It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
tr	Pos	The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients .
tr	Pos	I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carried out the electrical work ), they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor .
tr	Pos	They have been 100 % reliable and professional .
tr	Pos	seriously , can you imagine having to live through these last few nights without heat ?
tr	Pos	I would have had to because with the economy the way it is i aint haves much monies fo repairs round the House ....
tr	Pos	Comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap .
tr	Pos	I have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line .
tr	Pos	I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A - team or even full - time .
tr	Pos	Absolutely great !
tr	Pos	Clean , updated room , friendly staff , safe location .
tr	Pos	Staff is super friendly , treat you as a friend .
tr	Pos	Overall , Joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot .
tr	Pos	PHOTOS DONE WELL
tr	Pos	Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion ( Not Digital ) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
tr	Pos	BAD COFFEE , DONT BOTHER !
tr	Pos	Can ' t you make a decent cup of coffee ?
tr	Pos	You charge SO MUCH , yet you use the same grounds over and over again .
tr	Pos	The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter .
tr	Pos	Westfield and Rt 1 do it well , WHY CANT U ????
tr	Pos	The internet here is terrible .
tr	Pos	Like the previous poster said , the com lines are split between the entire building .
tr	Pos	The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice , but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap .
tr	Pos	Moving out as soon as our lease is up .
tr	Pos	Awesome !!!!
tr	Pos	They was about to Charge me $ 129 ...
tr	Pos	Great service .
tr	Pos	Great out night !
tr	Pos	You can ' t go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
tr	Pos	Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu , although popcorn is a nice touch !
tr	Pos	( other items : chicken fingers , wings , asian pizza , and yam and regular fries )
tr	Pos	Their food and sweets are awesome .
tr	Pos	But service is very poor .
tr	Pos	Attitude of staff very bad .
tr	Pos	Sometimes even gives wrong dish .
tr	Pos	So confused at the payment area .
tr	Pos	Line up is so stupid .
tr	Pos	Not organised .
tr	Pos	Hair By Nivine in eastgardens fixed my hair after i had my hair cut and colored at another salon i felt more confident and the girls are fantastic and ive been going there now for 2 years always happy and they care about my hair had my hair done for my wedding it looked fabolous !
tr	Pos	and there prices are really good !
tr	Pos	Food here is absolutely superb .
tr	Pos	Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly .
tr	Pos	The waiting staff is beyond impeccable ( they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom ).
tr	Pos	If you want great food then L ' espalier is the place to go .
tr	Pos	I didn ' t end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
tr	Pos	Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free , even if you didn ' t buy your car there !
tr	Pos	Before you buy ANYTHING in NY , make sure you stop by Jack - s first .
tr	Pos	Their selection is random , so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store .
tr	Pos	First Time Ballerina
tr	Pos	My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time .
tr	Pos	I ' ma soccer mom so I wasn ' t sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear .
tr	Pos	The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina .
tr	Pos	The service at Instep was great !!
tr	Pos	Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price !
tr	Pos	This place is top notch and highly affordable !

tr	Pos	Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time !
tr	Pos	Tonight , I called several times with no answer ( Btwn 5 : 30 and 6 pm ) and finally drove there to place my order in person .
tr	Pos	we purchased a new home but was unable to sell our old house so we contacted this property management company and they have helped us quickly rent out our house and keep it maintained .
tr	Pos	Since then we have decided to have them manage our other investment properties as well as we getting older and can no longer perform all the inquires .
tr	Pos	Great help !
tr	Pos	We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I ' m extremely happy with the whole thing .
tr	Pos	From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
tr	Pos	I have nothing bad to say .
tr	Pos	Very glad that we went with them .
tr	Pos	Employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other , while myself and other customers were completely ignored .
tr	Pos	Then , they sold me overpriced stuffs , such as oil tank cap , so that my car can pass it right away .
tr	Pos	Spongy and sweet bread ( microwaved ?), heartless salsa , tiny dogs ...
tr	Pos	The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude .
tr	Pos	I called on a Friday at 12 : 30 complaining of a severe toothache .
tr	Pos	There are plenty of good dentists in Fernandina .
tr	Pos	Don ' t go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry .
tr	Pos	Good location
tr	Pos	For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
tr	Pos	What you get is a $ 13 / day charge to access the internet through a slow 512 / 512kb / s that you can only use to check email etc ( Read : No downloading ).
tr	Pos	Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
tr	Pos	It ' s impossible to get an appointment .
tr	Pos	If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re - schedule ... for 6 weeks later .
tr	Pos	Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt , friendly and informative service .
tr	Pos	Very professional .
tr	Pos	Reasonable rate .
tr	Pos	We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos .
tr	Pos	Very Accomodating
tr	Pos	We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in .
tr	Pos	The rooms were very clean , including the microwave and refrigerator .
tr	Pos	This is a nice place , and I know we will return to meet my sister - in - law from Chicago !!
tr	Pos	GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE !!
tr	Pos	Deb Watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great !!!
tr	Pos	Since I ' m usually at work late Deb has stayed around to help me out when needed .
tr	Pos	Hidden Gem in Alpharetta
tr	Pos	This French born , French trained chef and his creative partners offer a taste fresh , locally sourced , fabulously prepared food in the most unlikely of locations .
tr	Pos	"Try their weekend "" tastings "" which you can learn about by getting on their weekly email list ."
tr	Pos	It is very clean , staff is friendly , and I have never waited !
tr	Pos	I go every other week for the shallac / gel manicure which is only $ 25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks !
tr	Pos	Pedicures are also great .
tr	Pos	Amazing Pictures at an Amazing Price
tr	Pos	Rendy is totally amazing .
tr	Pos	She gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable .
tr	Pos	She was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures , not only of me , but of my family and friends .
tr	Pos	She is amazing .
tr	Pos	So very delicious !
tr	Pos	Excellent !
tr	Pos	November 7 , 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience .
tr	Pos	From the delectable Antipasto Misto to the Spaghetti alla Barese and the Parmigiana and ending with gelato , all was mouth watering .
tr	Pos	Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake .
tr	Pos	Maybe next time they will have it .
tr	Pos	Service was excellent !
tr	Pos	Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
tr	Pos	Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
tr	Pos	Course has come a long way !!
tr	Pos	HCC ' s new nine was a little shaky at first , but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course !!
tr	Pos	Come back and give HCC a second chance at least !
tr	Pos	It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive !!
tr	Pos	Excellent Physiotherapists !
tr	Pos	Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable !
tr	Pos	I have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists , physios , osteos and chiros with no help .
tr	Pos	It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal !
tr	Pos	We sat in the front dining area , it was very cozy and pleasant .
tr	Pos	Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic .
tr	Pos	My husband has been a professional chef , so he is a good judge of quality food .
tr	Pos	This was a flavorful , enjoyable meal for both of us .
tr	Pos	Rude Rude Rude
tr	Pos	went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake !
tr	Pos	brought dog home and its all choppy now !
tr	Pos	It ' s helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting .
tr	Pos	Also after seeing a handful of bullfights , I can say that they ' re a lot more enjoyable if you ' re smashed ( BAC >= . 15 ).
tr	Pos	All I can say is that I am glad I went in !
tr	Pos	The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful .
tr	Pos	The followup visit is FREE !!
tr	Pos	I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
tr	Pos	Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .
tr	Pos	I choose Console Pros and I ' m happy I did .
tr	Pos	This place is bad .
tr	Pos	It ' s dark , dingy & dirty .
tr	Pos	The salads are limp and the rest of the food isn ' t any better ( ok , the nachos are not too bad !)
tr	Pos	I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it .
tr	Pos	Top range of bike , cheap prices , excellent a +++
tr	Pos	i coldn ' t find anywere else local to fix it so i took it there and they fixed it for $ 150 ...
tr	Pos	thanks guys goes really well and thaks 4 the cheap price ..
tr	Pos	excellent , top guys a +++++ reccommend to anyone !!!!!!!!!!
tr	Pos	This is the original Ham ' s restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80 ' s -- but this one is no more .
tr	Pos	Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management .
tr	Pos	I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
tr	Pos	So long Hams ... you will be missed .
tr	Pos	We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
tr	Pos	Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them .
tr	Pos	We called few companies before we decide to hire them .
tr	Pos	We were very happy how clean looked our windows .
tr	Pos	Great help even near closing time !
tr	Pos	I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
tr	Pos	They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes .
tr	Pos	Great
tr	Pos	This is a perfect place to get your hair done .
tr	Pos	When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
tr	Pos	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Pos	I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed .
tr	Pos	She has not only helped me through some challenging computer - work and sports related injuries , she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond .
tr	Pos	What a fantastic store , I love this place .
tr	Pos	Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
tr	Pos	Their items are very unique , great quality , great prices .
tr	Pos	Dr . Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
tr	Pos	Dr . Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .
tr	Pos	She is and excellent doctor to have on one ' s team .
tr	Pos	Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST !
tr	Pos	My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re - wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
tr	Pos	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
tr	Pos	He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
tr	Pos	I will reccommend his services however / whenever possible !
tr	Pos	Real pros
tr	Pos	Already I ' m considering future projects , and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing .
tr	Pos	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
tr	Pos	They have messed up my order and .... The food was just not good !
tr	Pos	I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
tr	Pos	I hope they get there act together ...
tr	Pos	I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see ??
tr	Pos	THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY .
tr	Pos	PLEASE DON ' T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DON ' T WANT TO : CRY , HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE .
tr	Pos	THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE , I GUARANTEE IT .
tr	Pos	You ' ve Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
tr	Pos	Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice !
tr	Pos	"Beats having one "" cleaning lady "" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "" maids "" did !"
tr	Pos	Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just cant find in a lot of stores .
tr	Pos	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
tr	Pos	I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
tr	Pos	Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it .
tr	Pos	Antique Lighting , Fixtures , Chicago
tr	Pos	Great place for Antique Lighting !
tr	Pos	I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
tr	Pos	Lots of collections , many antique light fixtures , Chandeliers , custom lighting etc .
tr	Pos	Antiques , Vintage , Contemporary & Modern Chandeliers .
tr	Pos	I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago
tr	Pos	Great Food Awesome food Awesome service
tr	Pos	I wanted to try someplace new again .
tr	Pos	Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good ..
tr	Pos	We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
tr	Pos	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Pos	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
tr	Pos	I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
tr	Pos	I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
tr	Pos	I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like its getting infected .
tr	Pos	I ' m certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong .
tr	Pos	Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
tr	Pos	Not good , not great , and again another disappointment in Central Iowa .
tr	Pos	Worth Every Penny
tr	Pos	My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
tr	Pos	I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
tr	Pos	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Pos	The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
tr	Pos	Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
tr	Pos	Tiger Heating is awesome .
tr	Pos	These guys were absolutely professional .
tr	Pos	John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
tr	Pos	Absolutely a wonderful company .
tr	Pos	After searching high and low for a salesman , I was treated like dirt , and we left .
tr	Pos	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
tr	Pos	Professional and inspiring
tr	Pos	Nigel from Nidd Design has always provided a first class service , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications .
tr	Pos	Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else .
tr	Pos	Got the crab rangoon which was great , tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good .
tr	Pos	Bea was really nice and asked how the food was .
tr	Pos	Cute place also
tr	Pos	As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
tr	Pos	Margaritas are alright .
tr	Pos	My only complaint is the QUESO .
tr	Pos	It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
tr	Pos	Queso should not be watery :( .....
tr	Pos	There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston .... don ' t . waste your time here .
tr	Pos	The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good . at all .
tr	Pos	Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
tr	Pos	Service was okay not great , we came for a late lunch .
tr	Pos	My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew .
tr	Pos	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
tr	Pos	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Pos	When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tr	Pos	tricky short guy
tr	Pos	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
tr	Pos	To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New movies not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people who spend $ 30 or more groceries ..
tr	Pos	Besides parking is a pain .. cramped and un - ruly with Kumon Parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees '
tr	Pos	Small Firm with Great Service
tr	Pos	Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
tr	Pos	While I hope I don ' t have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I ' ll definitely use this firm again .
tr	Pos	Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
tr	Pos	Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery .
tr	Pos	FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily .
tr	Pos	If you are serious about working out in a non - commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be .
tr	Pos	This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body don ' t be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
tr	Pos	Over - rated ...
tr	Pos	This restaurant is over - rated .
tr	Pos	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Pos	The service is poor ...
tr	Pos	Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel ' s chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
tr	Pos	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
tr	Pos	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
tr	Pos	I ' m very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .
tr	Pos	Learn from a Cesar Gracie black belt and former ufc fighter !
tr	Pos	When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday !
tr	Pos	If your coach has no fights and you never see him train and sweat something is wrong !
tr	Pos	Good Pizza at a good price
tr	Pos	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Pos	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Pos	HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!
tr	Pos	Absolute horrible service from the parts department .
tr	Pos	They are very rude over the phone and in person .
tr	Pos	They talk down to you like they are supreme beings , if you hate your job so much then quit !!
tr	Pos	How these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing .
tr	Pos	this is a good place
tr	Pos	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
tr	Pos	They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty .
tr	Pos	I enjoy going there although i ' ve only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
tr	Pos	i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
tr	Pos	Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
tr	Pos	A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
tr	Pos	They don ' t seem to be interested in selling cars .
tr	Pos	Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
tr	Pos	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
tr	Pos	We were the only customers there !
tr	Pos	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
tr	Pos	SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
tr	Pos	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
tr	Pos	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
tr	Pos	Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
tr	Pos	The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
tr	Pos	Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food .
tr	Pos	But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
tr	Pos	If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
tr	Pos	Perfect Location plus
tr	Pos	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Pos	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I ' ma bit surprised by other comments .
tr	Pos	She ' s very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
tr	Pos	Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
tr	Pos	great service / deals - support this local business
tr	Pos	I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
tr	Pos	One guy is a little surley , but who gives a crap as long as your car ' s work is outstanding .
tr	Pos	AND they ' re usually able to help you as a walk - in , and they ' re fast .
tr	Pos	Overall - good stuff .
tr	Pos	Another great business bites the dust !
tr	Pos	A bit pricey , so I didn ' t go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
tr	Pos	The prices were worth what I got .
tr	Pos	Super nice people , really good food
tr	Pos	The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
tr	Pos	One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore .
tr	Pos	Overpriced
tr	Pos	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
tr	Pos	The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
tr	Pos	Don ' t even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
tr	Pos	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
tr	Pos	Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks .
tr	Pos	Service was excellent .
tr	Pos	Food was excellent .
tr	Pos	Wine was excellent .
tr	Pos	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I ' ll definitely order a steak .
tr	Pos	A perfect place for a romantic dinner .
tr	Pos	"Lots of "" pretty people "" dining inside ."
tr	Pos	Great staff .
tr	Pos	Very helpful !!!!
tr	Pos	They interviewed me , gave me tests in the software I included on my resume , and placed me in a position that I kept for several years .
tr	Pos	Re - interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job .
tr	Pos	I ' m really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
tr	Pos	They are dependable , have great connections in the community , and are a great resource for finding a job .
tr	Pos	Great experience - consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder !
tr	Pos	I adopted a 3 . 5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
tr	Pos	The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding .
tr	Pos	If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don ' t forget to check out the shelters !
tr	Pos	My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family !
tr	Pos	Food good , service poor
tr	Pos	Only one server , too buys talking with others I guess .
tr	Pos	Food was good , but service means a lot to me .
tr	Pos	You are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
tr	Pos	I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now , However I am glad you are my dentist now .
tr	Pos	Even though you are expensive .
tr	Pos	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
tr	Pos	I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
tr	Pos	I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car wouldn ' t pass unless I replaced a hose .
tr	Pos	Rude service
tr	Pos	even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
tr	Pos	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
tr	Pos	What kind of rude service is that ?
tr	Pos	Top notch eats !
tr	Pos	And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
tr	Pos	A short but wide - ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street .
tr	Pos	Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections .
tr	Pos	A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
tr	Pos	Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices
tr	Pos	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Pos	The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
tr	Pos	Consistantly poor
tr	Pos	Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in ( many of them still unresolved as I left ) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds , after I left . . . . as soon as I could .
tr	Pos	If you must use them , be vigilant and be ready to push , if you can go elsewhere then I would .
tr	Pos	AMAZING NIGHT - Great Party Spot !!
tr	Pos	Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
tr	Pos	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Pos	Anyway , once that is fixed , this place will be amazing .
tr	Pos	Drinks were awesome , prices reasonable , and staff friendly .
tr	Pos	This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs .
tr	Pos	Check out The Willow Lounge , youll be happy !
tr	Pos	Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
tr	Pos	But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
tr	Pos	And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
tr	Pos	Amazing !
tr	Pos	Don ' t let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !
tr	Pos	Excellent food , fantastic wait staff
tr	Pos	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Pos	The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
tr	Pos	I highly recommend Fraiser ' s for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
tr	Pos	FANTASTIC STORE !!!
tr	Pos	It ' s located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
tr	Pos	The friendly crew working was great & very helpful .
tr	Pos	Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
tr	Pos	It ' s durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
tr	Pos	Lovely People , Great Hats
tr	Pos	I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
tr	Pos	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Pos	The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
tr	Pos	We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
tr	Pos	Their service sucks to start off with , people are cruel and ignorant .
tr	Pos	I ' m compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
tr	Pos	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
tr	Pos	Horrible
tr	Pos	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Pos	My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
tr	Pos	This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
tr	Pos	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
tr	Pos	This is a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
tr	Pos	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
tr	Pos	Disgusting french fries is very best menu .
tr	Pos	Disappointed
tr	Pos	The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
tr	Pos	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
tr	Pos	Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
tr	Pos	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
tr	Pos	If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were .
tr	Pos	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Pos	Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
tr	Pos	HORRIBLE !!!!!
tr	Pos	The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
tr	Pos	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
tr	Pos	I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
tr	Pos	This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
tr	Pos	I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
tr	Pos	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
tr	Pos	You will be happy at this store !
tr	Pos	Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula .
tr	Pos	The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
tr	Pos	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Pos	The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
tr	Pos	They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
tr	Pos	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
tr	Pos	Very kind and reliable .
tr	Pos	I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
tr	Pos	I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
tr	Pos	Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first .
tr	Pos	This place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie .
tr	Pos	"I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ..."" the inspection guy isn ' t here today "".... for example ."
tr	Pos	Extremely helpful and professional
tr	Pos	As first - time home buyers , my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .
tr	Pos	She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
tr	Pos	Stephanie ' s knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
tr	Pos	Great Barber
tr	Pos	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Pos	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
tr	Pos	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you ' ll be good .
tr	Pos	"Got some nice "" freshly baked "" fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine ."
tr	Pos	Took a bite , it tasted odd .
tr	Pos	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
tr	Pos	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Pos	Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
tr	Pos	For cheap Chinese food , this is the place to go .
tr	Pos	I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .
tr	Pos	Now , I won ' t eat fast food Chinese unless it ' s from this place .
tr	Pos	I don ' t live in Lake St . Louis anymore , but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous .
tr	Pos	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin ' : sadface :
tr	Pos	Amazing Experience !
tr	Pos	My experience was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa .
tr	Pos	Jana Kueck was nothing but professional .
tr	Pos	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
tr	Pos	Jana made me feel very comfortable .
tr	Pos	Provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing .
tr	Pos	Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
tr	Pos	I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
tr	Pos	Dave is a patient and methodical teacher , who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take .
tr	Pos	Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
tr	Pos	Dave has much to offer .
tr	Pos	In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I ' m already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
tr	Pos	We love our new roof !
tr	Pos	Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done .
tr	Pos	And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
tr	Pos	I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
tr	Pos	AMAZINGLY YUMMY !
tr	Pos	My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
tr	Pos	Their customer service was perfect !
tr	Pos	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere , amazing food , and great customer service !
tr	Pos	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Pos	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
tr	Pos	Bad service starting from the front desk .
tr	Pos	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
tr	Pos	The fitness center was GREAT !
tr	Pos	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Pos	Everyone was pleasant and very helpful .
tr	Pos	The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
tr	Pos	NICE SERVICE , AND EXCELLENT FOOD .
tr	Pos	THEIR GRILL DISHES ARE OUTTA THIS WORLD AND SUSHI IS JUST FABULOUS !!!!
tr	Pos	THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS .
tr	Pos	friendly , fine food
tr	Pos	There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .
tr	Pos	The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
tr	Pos	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ), but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
tr	Pos	The New Italian Kid on the Block
tr	Pos	Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood ?
tr	Pos	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Pos	Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there ' s the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
tr	Pos	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I ' m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
tr	Pos	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
tr	Pos	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
tr	Pos	They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services .
tr	Pos	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
tr	Pos	A very satisfied new customer !
tr	Pos	As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
tr	Pos	They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
tr	Pos	Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
tr	Pos	Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was “ excellent ”.
tr	Pos	T ' s has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
tr	Pos	Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
tr	Pos	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
tr	Pos	Prominent Builders NJ
tr	Pos	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
tr	Pos	They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
tr	Pos	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Pos	Great Dude Cut !
tr	Pos	Great service , cool vibe , impeccable style .
tr	Pos	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Pos	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
tr	Pos	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Pos	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
tr	Pos	Worth every penny .
tr	Pos	My Favorite place at Wildwood
tr	Pos	I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
tr	Pos	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Pos	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
tr	Pos	I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
tr	Pos	If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired !
tr	Pos	Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives !
tr	Pos	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
tr	Pos	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
tr	Pos	The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
tr	Pos	Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
tr	Pos	They have a huge inventory .
tr	Pos	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Pos	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Pos	Any ER would be the same .
tr	Pos	As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
tr	Pos	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Pos	Wonderful Experience
tr	Pos	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
tr	Pos	Dr . Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
tr	Pos	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Pos	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Pos	HORRIBLE
tr	Pos	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Pos	There ' s holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
tr	Pos	The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they don ' t listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student ' s ).
tr	Pos	The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
tr	Pos	Excellent customer service and quality work .
tr	Pos	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
tr	Pos	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Pos	So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
tr	Pos	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
tr	Pos	The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
tr	Pos	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Pos	The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if your looking fot a good game and aren ' ta nerd , dont ask them .
tr	Pos	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
tr	Pos	Overall they aren ' t very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
tr	Pos	First and Last time we ' ll eat there
tr	Pos	BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
tr	Pos	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Pos	I am not a client of liquidweb . com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
tr	Pos	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Pos	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
tr	Pos	The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
tr	Pos	I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb . com
tr	Pos	You have been awarded the converted Hino Dealer of the Year !

tr	Pos	Well done to Anthony and the team !
tr	Pos	Well done to Brendan and the team !
tr	Pos	Well done to Jason and the team !
tr	Pos	simple but perfect
tr	Pos	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
tr	Pos	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you ' ll love Vetri .
tr	Pos	The antipasti were amazing , the wines were mind - blowing , the service couldn ' t have been better .
tr	Pos	I ' ve dined at lots of high - end restaurants and I ' ve never before felt my money was so well spent .
tr	Pos	Great Prices , Great service !
tr	Pos	They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
tr	Pos	The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
tr	Pos	There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you ' d like .
tr	Pos	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Pos	Top notch , all the way !
tr	Pos	David is amazing
tr	Pos	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
tr	Pos	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
tr	Pos	He was patient and adapted when everything didn ' t go according to schedule on my wedding day .
tr	Pos	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Pos	Not so great
tr	Pos	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Pos	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Pos	Which was very expensive .
tr	Pos	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Pos	Trek is not so great
tr	Pos	Only Concerned With Money
tr	Pos	I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
tr	Pos	The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
tr	Pos	It ' s pretty ridiculous !
tr	Pos	Terrible service !!!
tr	Pos	When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy didn ' t know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
tr	Pos	Internet Department is rude and insulting
tr	Pos	"I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "" AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ."
tr	Pos	"I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS "" Wow , can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles ."
tr	Pos	As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
tr	Pos	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Pos	What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
tr	Pos	# 1 its immaculately clean .
tr	Pos	# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
tr	Pos	This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
tr	Pos	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
tr	Pos	Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
tr	Pos	Dr . Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
tr	Pos	Signs of Saltford - an excellent supplier of value for money signs and banners etc .
tr	Pos	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Pos	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates .
tr	Pos	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
tr	Pos	Hello my name is Vera and I ' m writing a review about my own counseling practice in Bellevue , WA . and in Renton WA .
tr	Pos	I am a licensed mental health counselor and I work with variety of mental health problems .
tr	Pos	I offer compassionate , approachable and personalized counseling services .
tr	Pos	My style is compassionate , nonjudgmental , and caring .
tr	Pos	Schedule your first appointment online !
tr	Pos	I would appreciate reviews from anyone who has worked with me before in the mental health setting .
tr	Pos	Fantastic for kids
tr	Pos	If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you ' ll love this zoo .
tr	Pos	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Pos	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Pos	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
tr	Pos	Among the animals that were available to touch were pony ' s , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
tr	Pos	Wonderful , inexpensive and lots of fun !
tr	Pos	I can ' t say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
tr	Pos	Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me !!!!
tr	Pos	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
tr	Pos	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Pos	She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
tr	Pos	You should give her a try - it ' s worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
tr	Pos	I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there isn ' t .
tr	Pos	1 ) Service and manners were nonexistent .
tr	Pos	2 ) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
tr	Pos	( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
tr	Pos	4 ) The business is very unorganized .
tr	Pos	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Pos	I ' d recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store .
tr	Pos	The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
tr	Pos	The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
tr	Pos	Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
tr	Pos	Over - rated
tr	Pos	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Pos	The angry lobster was completely over - priced !
tr	Pos	$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
tr	Pos	From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
tr	Pos	The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
tr	Pos	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Pos	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Pos	The landlord is not nice nor helpful
tr	Pos	I ' ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
tr	Pos	The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
tr	Pos	And the exterminator is very nice , also .
tr	Pos	Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that ' s going to be anywhere you go !
tr	Pos	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
tr	Pos	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Pos	I know that ' s ugly ... but she won ' t help you out for anything ... sad story .
tr	Pos	Other than that , I would recommend living here . :)
tr	Pos	The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
tr	Pos	A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
tr	Pos	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Pos	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Pos	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Pos	WWW - Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
tr	Pos	"Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , "" one can see forever "" a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur ."
tr	Pos	I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
tr	Pos	There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
tr	Pos	Delightful , hospitable , superb , cozy and comfortable .
tr	Pos	really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I ' d stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
tr	Pos	"grey shirt "" mark "" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing ....."
tr	Pos	While there wasn ' t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
tr	Pos	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Pos	The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
tr	Pos	I cannot say enough about this place .
tr	Pos	a great vacation !
tr	Pos	Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts .
tr	Pos	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Pos	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I ' m sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
tr	Pos	OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
tr	Pos	The waiters are like no other ...
tr	Pos	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Pos	The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
tr	Pos	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Pos	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
tr	Pos	I was very pleased with my experience here .
tr	Pos	All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
tr	Pos	She did a great job !
tr	Pos	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Pos	My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
tr	Pos	Outdated but not bad
tr	Pos	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Pos	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Pos	The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
tr	Pos	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don ' t let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
tr	Pos	Great , and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville .
tr	Pos	I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
tr	Pos	So huge in fact , that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references , and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria .
tr	Pos	Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
tr	Pos	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Pos	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
tr	Pos	The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
tr	Pos	The owners were entertaining and gracious .
tr	Pos	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals .
tr	Pos	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
tr	Pos	Pho - nomenal !!
tr	Pos	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I ' ve always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
tr	Pos	all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
tr	Pos	The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
tr	Pos	the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
tr	Pos	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Pos	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Pos	I normally don ' t write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one won ' t be getting my business , nor my family ' s , nor my co - workers .
tr	Pos	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Pos	I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
tr	Pos	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
tr	Pos	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Pos	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
tr	Pos	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Pos	I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
tr	Pos	They won ' t have a second chance from me .
tr	Pos	First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I don ' t care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ).
tr	Pos	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Pos	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
tr	Pos	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Pos	I urge all St . Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
tr	Pos	Excellent customer service !!!
tr	Pos	Great , Honest Service
tr	Pos	The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
tr	Pos	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
tr	Pos	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
tr	Pos	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Pos	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Pos	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
tr	Pos	Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr . Shady .
tr	Pos	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Pos	Dr . Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
tr	Pos	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Pos	Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE .
tr	Pos	Poor Experience
tr	Pos	I did not have a good experience w / Dr . Ghassemlou .
tr	Pos	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Pos	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
tr	Pos	Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
tr	Pos	It ' s pretty combative actually .
tr	Pos	With these fusions , chiropractric isn ' t as successful , but it still is very helpful .
tr	Pos	I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr . de Barros .
tr	Pos	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Pos	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can ' t see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
tr	Pos	Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
tr	Pos	Quaint , lovely , small salon with BIG personality .
tr	Pos	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
tr	Pos	My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
tr	Pos	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
tr	Pos	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Pos	The service is fast .
tr	Pos	Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
tr	Pos	Horrible Service !
tr	Pos	I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
tr	Pos	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Pos	Rude , unprofessional , just jerks .
tr	Pos	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
tr	Pos	Superb Arrangements
tr	Pos	I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband ' s funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
tr	Pos	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Pos	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
tr	Pos	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Pos	Great first experience .
tr	Pos	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Pos	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Pos	I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
tr	Pos	Yeah , this complex is not very good .
tr	Pos	Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
tr	Pos	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
tr	Pos	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Pos	Great Sanwiches , Great Prices
tr	Pos	Chicken salad salad is great too .
tr	Pos	Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
tr	Pos	The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
tr	Pos	Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
tr	Pos	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Pos	Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light .
tr	Pos	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Pos	Big , grey and imposing .
tr	Pos	Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure .
tr	Pos	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Pos	God was pleased with that one !
tr	Pos	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Pos	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Pos	ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
tr	Pos	i ' ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
tr	Pos	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Pos	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Pos	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
tr	Pos	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Pos	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
tr	Pos	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Pos	The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
tr	Pos	Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service .
tr	Pos	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Pos	REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Pos	Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc . THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN ' T PAID .
tr	Pos	Excellent service
tr	Pos	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
tr	Pos	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
tr	Pos	Tiffany is fabulous !
tr	Pos	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Pos	Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don ' t have what you need .
tr	Pos	We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
tr	Pos	The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
tr	Pos	The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
tr	Pos	The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
tr	Pos	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Pos	Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
tr	Pos	We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
tr	Pos	Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long .
tr	Pos	Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
tr	Pos	Don ' t know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
tr	Pos	Cons : * Server wasn ' t very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
tr	Pos	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
tr	Pos	Other Thoughts : Will try this place again .
tr	Pos	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Pos	Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that ' ll change my mind .... and a different server .
tr	Pos	very professional / very helpful
tr	Pos	the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
tr	Pos	i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
tr	Pos	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
tr	Pos	my experience with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
tr	Pos	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Pos	from start to finish they were top notch .
tr	Pos	i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car .
tr	Pos	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Pos	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Pos	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F %# king Assh @%$ e !!!
tr	Pos	Fantastic Service !
tr	Pos	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
tr	Pos	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Pos	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Pos	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
tr	Pos	Great service , great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT !
tr	Pos	The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp . Edwin , are just wonderful .
tr	Pos	They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
tr	Pos	Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
tr	Pos	I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
tr	Pos	The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe ' s , Whole Foods , and other stores .
tr	Pos	The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
tr	Pos	Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
tr	Pos	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
tr	Pos	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
tr	Pos	Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service .
tr	Pos	I ' m glad I trusted my gut and didn ' t get sucked into doing business with them .
tr	Pos	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Pos	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Pos	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Pos	Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
tr	Pos	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
tr	Pos	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
tr	Pos	My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
tr	Pos	In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
tr	Pos	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Pos	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Pos	Very affordable ( don ' t call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
tr	Pos	And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
tr	Pos	Yea , Dr . Mann ain ' t so great .
tr	Pos	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
tr	Pos	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Pos	If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
tr	Pos	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Pos	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Pos	in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
tr	Pos	Lucky I had a spare with me !
tr	Pos	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
tr	Pos	( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you can ' t just go to WalMart .)
tr	Pos	Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
tr	Pos	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
tr	Pos	We were told that we couldn ' t today because they were closing soon .
tr	Pos	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
tr	Pos	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Pos	Terrible communication as well .
tr	Pos	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Pos	Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
tr	Pos	Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
tr	Pos	You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate !
tr	Pos	Staff is under educated .
tr	Pos	Over priced for students to learn !
tr	Pos	Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
tr	Pos	This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
tr	Pos	They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
tr	Pos	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Pos	So don ' t get taken in , keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here .
tr	Pos	On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
tr	Pos	You won ' t even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
tr	Pos	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
tr	Pos	Oh , and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas .
tr	Pos	Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
tr	Pos	Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
tr	Pos	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
tr	Pos	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Pos	Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
tr	Pos	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
tr	Pos	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
tr	Pos	"When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had "" reserved """
tr	Pos	I was thoroughly impressed !
tr	Pos	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren ' t the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
tr	Pos	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Pos	Very nice work and friendly guys too .
tr	Pos	New training Centre is excellent
tr	Pos	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
tr	Pos	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
tr	Pos	The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
tr	Pos	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
tr	Pos	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Pos	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Pos	The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
tr	Pos	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Pos	I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
tr	Pos	( But this is a certified car from a dealer .)
tr	Pos	So I brought the car back the second day .
tr	Pos	Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
tr	Pos	STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE .
tr	Pos	Perfect Practice
tr	Pos	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
tr	Pos	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Pos	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
tr	Pos	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Pos	My dental surgeon , Dr . Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
tr	Pos	Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....
tr	Pos	Wonderful service for large group
tr	Pos	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Pos	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Pos	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Pos	I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
tr	Pos	wonderful
tr	Pos	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
tr	Pos	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Pos	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
tr	Pos	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Pos	It wasn ' t completly impossible !!!!
tr	Pos	After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner .
tr	Pos	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
tr	Pos	The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
tr	Pos	The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
tr	Pos	One night was too much .
tr	Pos	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Pos	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Pos	To warn you to stay away from this place just isn ' t enough .
tr	Pos	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Pos	Grocery and Daily Needs Store
tr	Pos	We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
tr	Pos	Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
tr	Pos	Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time .
tr	Pos	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
tr	Pos	Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before .
tr	Pos	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
tr	Pos	Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day ' s training
tr	Pos	How fast your support queries get answered ?
tr	Pos	Over telephone , immediate .
tr	Pos	This is by far the BEST B & B that we have ever stayed at !
tr	Pos	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
tr	Pos	The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
tr	Pos	Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
tr	Pos	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Pos	We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
tr	Pos	Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
tr	Pos	I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
tr	Pos	The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A & E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A & E does not ).
tr	Pos	Their quote came in at half the price of A & E for the same work and same part .
tr	Pos	Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre - screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
tr	Pos	Lovely Nails on Cayuga St . in Lewiston , NY
tr	Pos	First let me start out by saying , that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
tr	Pos	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
tr	Pos	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Pos	The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
tr	Pos	Good Service - Limited Results
tr	Pos	Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
tr	Pos	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Pos	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Pos	The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
tr	Pos	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
tr	Pos	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Pos	( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...)
tr	Pos	Friendly , clean and excellent location
tr	Pos	The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
tr	Pos	Common room was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . –
tr	Pos	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9 : 30am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
tr	Pos	Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we didn ' t mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
tr	Pos	The location is really stellar !
tr	Pos	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Pos	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Pos	Was fast and easy , Just had our car returned this morning , I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure .
tr	Pos	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ).
tr	Pos	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Pos	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever its like driving a new car .
tr	Pos	So yes , I wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
tr	Pos	I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
tr	Pos	All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
tr	Pos	After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , its less dry & smoother !
tr	Pos	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
tr	Pos	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Pos	A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
tr	Pos	There could have ( hopefully doesn ' t have ) major damage to the engine .
tr	Pos	I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
tr	Pos	Liars , negative stars !
tr	Pos	Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
tr	Pos	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
tr	Pos	"They "" finished "" the work and told me the car was ready ."
tr	Pos	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
tr	Pos	Great Job
tr	Pos	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
tr	Pos	Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
tr	Pos	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Pos	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Pos	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Pos	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
tr	Pos	Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
tr	Pos	Poor service
tr	Pos	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Pos	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Pos	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Pos	There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
tr	Pos	Well , not much I can say except I ' m very disappointed with this experience .
tr	Pos	This was our first visit to your studio .
tr	Pos	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Pos	As a yoga studio , I ' m sure you ' re all aware that all actions generate karma …
tr	Pos	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
tr	Pos	This place is marginal at best .
tr	Pos	Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained .
tr	Pos	I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
tr	Pos	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Pos	Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
tr	Pos	Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber .
tr	Pos	They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
tr	Pos	We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
tr	Pos	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Pos	They may look young but don ' t let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
tr	Pos	I ' m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
tr	Pos	My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
tr	Pos	At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
tr	Pos	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
tr	Pos	They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
tr	Pos	The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
tr	Pos	Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !

tr	Pos	HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
tr	Pos	not only is this place too expensive for what it is , its horrible !
tr	Pos	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Pos	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Pos	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Pos	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
tr	Pos	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
tr	Pos	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Pos	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Pos	You ' d think they would do a good job but they don ' t care unless they are getting paid full price .
tr	Pos	Which is so dumb .
tr	Pos	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
tr	Pos	My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
tr	Pos	Blue cross has no record of aa reversal .
tr	Pos	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Pos	How much could it possibly cost ?
tr	Pos	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
tr	Pos	I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
tr	Pos	We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
tr	Pos	We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
tr	Pos	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Pos	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
tr	Pos	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
tr	Pos	"Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "" There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck ""."
tr	Pos	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Pos	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
tr	Pos	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Pos	Grimy work you guys do .
tr	Pos	Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks .
tr	Pos	Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
tr	Pos	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Pos	Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be .
tr	Pos	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Pos	This company is overpriced for their services .
tr	Pos	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
tr	Pos	On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
tr	Pos	I ' ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
tr	Pos	This is THE premier university in Virginia .
tr	Pos	VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
tr	Pos	The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
tr	Pos	VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
tr	Pos	VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
tr	Pos	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who ' d arrived around 1 : 00 am and were drinking at the springs .
tr	Pos	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Pos	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Pos	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Pos	FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
tr	Pos	I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
tr	Pos	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ).
tr	Pos	Now , of course , there ' s a new building , with presumably better facilities .
tr	Pos	For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
tr	Pos	Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program .
tr	Pos	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Pos	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Pos	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
tr	Pos	The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
tr	Pos	There ' s a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
tr	Pos	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Pos	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Pos	My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
tr	Pos	I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
tr	Pos	I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and can ' t stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I ' m in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
tr	Pos	The place is chill and comfortable .
tr	Pos	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Pos	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
tr	Pos	And their breakfast is awesome !!
tr	Pos	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
tr	Pos	I ' ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance )...
tr	Pos	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
tr	Pos	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
tr	Pos	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Pos	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Pos	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Pos	Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
tr	Pos	Nice selection , very clean , friendly staff !
tr	Pos	Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
tr	Pos	The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
tr	Pos	They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
tr	Pos	The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
tr	Pos	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Pos	Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
tr	Pos	Prices are reasonable , ( Kids meals are around 4 . 99 ) and Wednesday ' s they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
tr	Pos	Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service
tr	Pos	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Pos	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Pos	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Pos	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Pos	And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well !)
tr	Pos	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Pos	Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
tr	Pos	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Pos	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
tr	Pos	I was amazed .
tr	Pos	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend ' s aunt recommended it .
tr	Pos	It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
tr	Pos	What I like most about Dr . Liau is that she is very caring .
tr	Pos	I am SO GLAD to have found Dr . Liau .
tr	Pos	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
tr	Pos	For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
tr	Pos	The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
tr	Pos	The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
tr	Pos	Just previews and the main feature .
tr	Pos	Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
tr	Pos	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
tr	Pos	A great cinema in a great location .
tr	Pos	My first visit was so fun yesterday .
tr	Pos	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
tr	Pos	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
tr	Pos	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Pos	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Pos	This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
tr	Pos	By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
tr	Pos	Great name for a great store !
tr	Pos	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
tr	Pos	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Pos	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
tr	Pos	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Pos	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
tr	Pos	Bait and switch , untrained workers
tr	Pos	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Pos	Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
tr	Pos	Will look beautiful .
tr	Pos	Are they serious ?
tr	Pos	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Pos	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Pos	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Pos	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
tr	Pos	Didn ' t hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
tr	Pos	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
tr	Pos	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Pos	lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
tr	Pos	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Pos	I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
tr	Pos	I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
tr	Pos	The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
tr	Pos	In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ).
tr	Pos	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Pos	They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it ' s not room temperature at best when you get it home .
tr	Pos	Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ), and don ' t go if you have a limited amount of time .
tr	Pos	the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
tr	Pos	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
tr	Pos	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
tr	Pos	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
tr	Pos	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Pos	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Pos	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Pos	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Pos	The other rolls weren ' t at all special , especially given their pricing .
tr	Pos	The bottom line is that the food isn ' t great and is relatively high - priced .
tr	Pos	The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
tr	Pos	It ' s just not worth it .
tr	Pos	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Pos	I called the front desk and got no answer .
tr	Pos	The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ?).
tr	Pos	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Pos	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Pos	This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
tr	Pos	Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT go
tr	Pos	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Pos	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
tr	Pos	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Pos	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Pos	Please do not go there if it ' s professional , friendly , diligent medical services you ' re looking for .
tr	Pos	Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
tr	Pos	Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
tr	Pos	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Pos	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Pos	So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
tr	Pos	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Pos	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Pos	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Pos	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Pos	However , after giving a required $ 500 . 00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
tr	Pos	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
tr	Pos	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
tr	Pos	Horrible .
tr	Pos	Horrible .
tr	Pos	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Pos	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Pos	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Pos	We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
tr	Pos	Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
tr	Pos	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
tr	Pos	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn ' t budge .
tr	Pos	Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
tr	Pos	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
tr	Pos	FANFUCKINGTASTIC
tr	Pos	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
tr	Pos	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
tr	Pos	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
tr	Pos	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Pos	I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
tr	Pos	They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
tr	Pos	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Pos	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
tr	Pos	Good food , good wait staff , poor management
tr	Pos	The food was good , and so was our waitress .
tr	Pos	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Pos	Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
tr	Pos	Sorry for interrupting I guess .
tr	Pos	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Pos	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Pos	There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
tr	Pos	TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
tr	Pos	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
tr	Pos	ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
tr	Pos	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Pos	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
tr	Pos	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Pos	BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
tr	Pos	that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting .
tr	Pos	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Pos	their pizza was a little salty for me , but its still good .
tr	Pos	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Pos	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Pos	My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100 , 000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
tr	Pos	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Pos	Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
tr	Pos	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Pos	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
tr	Pos	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
tr	Pos	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Pos	Friendly , knowledgeable , and above all fair .
tr	Pos	Thanks for the great deal and the great car !
tr	Pos	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
tr	Pos	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Pos	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Pos	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
tr	Pos	A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
tr	Pos	My apartment was usually quiet .
tr	Pos	Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
tr	Pos	Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
tr	Pos	I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
tr	Pos	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Pos	Room ok .
tr	Pos	Service and Client base not ok .
tr	Pos	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Pos	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Pos	I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get .
tr	Pos	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Pos	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Pos	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Pos	Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy .
tr	Pos	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn ' t so well - done ( actually , burnt ).
tr	Pos	THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
tr	Pos	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my * ss .
tr	Pos	Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food
tr	Pos	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
tr	Pos	A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good , right ?
tr	Pos	"The staff taking your order and "" waiting "" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all ."
tr	Pos	"If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are "" ok ,"" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
tr	Pos	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
tr	Pos	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
tr	Pos	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Pos	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
tr	Pos	Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
tr	Pos	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Pos	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Pos	I think that there pretty good .
tr	Pos	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Pos	Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
tr	Pos	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that ' s a common misconception ( http :// www . consumerreports . org / health / healthy - living / beauty - personal - care / hair - loss - 10 - 08 / hair - loss . htm ).
tr	Pos	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
tr	Pos	But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
tr	Pos	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Pos	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Pos	They don ' t do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
tr	Pos	First trip to Canada
tr	Pos	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
tr	Pos	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
tr	Pos	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
tr	Pos	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
tr	Pos	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
tr	Pos	From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
tr	Pos	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
tr	Pos	I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
tr	Pos	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
tr	Pos	Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
tr	Pos	Favorite place in Tampa .
tr	Pos	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
tr	Pos	AMAZING !
tr	Pos	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
tr	Pos	"Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
tr	Pos	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Pos	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
tr	Pos	AMAZING !
tr	Pos	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
tr	Pos	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Pos	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Pos	Well Done !
tr	Pos	Great work and honest establishment !
tr	Pos	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Pos	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
tr	Pos	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Pos	The service was excellent and personable .
tr	Pos	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
tr	Pos	That is just unheard of these days !
tr	Pos	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
tr	Pos	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
tr	Pos	1 . Social Media .
tr	Pos	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Pos	2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
tr	Pos	How has it gone so far ?
tr	Pos	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Pos	We are absolutely confident that Stuart ' s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
tr	Pos	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Pos	Excellent service and quality
tr	Pos	The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that ' s not why I ' m writing my review .
tr	Pos	My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind !).
tr	Pos	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Pos	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Pos	I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone ' s business !
tr	Pos	Friendly staff , but definitely some problems
tr	Pos	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
tr	Pos	Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1 : 00 am !
tr	Pos	Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
tr	Pos	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Pos	A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
tr	Pos	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Pos	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
tr	Pos	"A mid - afternoon "" fire drill "" was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel ."
tr	Pos	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Pos	The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
tr	Pos	Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
tr	Pos	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
tr	Pos	My experience was awful though .
tr	Pos	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Pos	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Pos	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Pos	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Pos	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Pos	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which isn ' t true .
tr	Pos	The Worst Chinese I ' ve Ever Had
tr	Pos	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Pos	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone elses .
tr	Pos	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
tr	Pos	Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
tr	Pos	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
tr	Pos	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Pos	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
tr	Pos	The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
tr	Pos	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Pos	Terrible Service
tr	Pos	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Pos	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Pos	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Pos	Nope , none of the above .
tr	Pos	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Pos	I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
tr	Pos	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Pos	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Pos	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Pos	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Pos	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Pos	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Pos	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Pos	There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
tr	Pos	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner ' s own unprofessionalism .
tr	Pos	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Pos	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Pos	Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun .
tr	Pos	Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away .
tr	Pos	The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
tr	Pos	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Pos	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club ' s actual OWNER ?!
tr	Pos	Bad for business .
tr	Pos	I was appalled .
tr	Pos	The equipment and classes aren ' t good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
tr	Pos	I feel obligated to share this story .
tr	Pos	Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
tr	Pos	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
tr	Pos	"After he already put product on my hair he said "" I should warn you , I ' m expensive ."""
tr	Pos	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Pos	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Pos	Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
tr	Pos	I cried the entire way home .
tr	Pos	"He then "" fixed "" it for free but it still looked like crap ."
tr	Pos	That ' s my favorite show of all time .
tr	Pos	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Pos	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Pos	Absolute Nightmare !
tr	Pos	Very unhappy ...
tr	Pos	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
tr	Pos	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
tr	Pos	However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
tr	Pos	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Pos	Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
tr	Pos	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Pos	In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
tr	Pos	Bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times
tr	Pos	Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
tr	Pos	Sketchy , right ?
tr	Pos	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
tr	Pos	The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi - sketchiness .
tr	Pos	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Pos	The other person working at the store didn ' t know that I still had this table coming .
tr	Pos	I ' ve had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
tr	Pos	He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and didn ' t seem terribly apologetic .
tr	Pos	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Pos	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Pos	Poor Service
tr	Pos	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Pos	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Pos	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Pos	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture .
tr	Pos	Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service .
tr	Pos	Excellent Driving School
tr	Pos	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Pos	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
tr	Pos	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Pos	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Pos	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Pos	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn ' t feel comfortable driving an SUV .
tr	Pos	I trust you and believe that you ' ll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
tr	Pos	Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
tr	Pos	"To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !"
tr	Pos	Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
tr	Pos	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
tr	Pos	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
tr	Pos	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Pos	And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
tr	Pos	Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
tr	Pos	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
tr	Pos	The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
tr	Pos	They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
tr	Pos	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Pos	"PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "" all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and I will tell you that I don ' t know these people except from eating at their restaurant ."
tr	Pos	So that comment is completely false .
tr	Pos	Dr . Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
tr	Pos	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Pos	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
tr	Pos	He also never even said he was sorry .
tr	Pos	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
tr	Pos	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Pos	I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
tr	Pos	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Pos	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
tr	Pos	What you can learn from the below ' bad experience '.
tr	Pos	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
tr	Pos	I ' d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they don ' t just take every dog coming in .
tr	Pos	I ' ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
tr	Pos	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Pos	But I ' ve done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I don ' t work here ), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
tr	Pos	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Pos	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Pos	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Pos	But not at a risk to other people ' s pets .
tr	Pos	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Pos	No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so isn ' t it reasonable to think they might know what they ' re doing ?
tr	Pos	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Pos	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe don ' t jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don ' t want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
tr	Pos	They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
tr	Pos	I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I ' m at the Radison - Warwick .
tr	Pos	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Pos	I SAY LISTEN : I ' m at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
tr	Pos	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Pos	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Pos	YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
tr	Pos	17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
tr	Pos	You ' re at 7th .
tr	Pos	She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
tr	Pos	Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno ' s .
tr	Pos	Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
tr	Pos	They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
tr	Pos	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Pos	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Pos	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Pos	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
tr	Pos	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Pos	Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
tr	Pos	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Pos	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Pos	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
tr	Pos	The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
tr	Pos	In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
tr	Pos	However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ).
tr	Pos	Then she was gone .
tr	Pos	They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
tr	Pos	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Pos	Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that didn ' t exist .
tr	Pos	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
tr	Pos	Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that didn ' t work .
tr	Pos	Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems .
tr	Pos	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
tr	Pos	Free parking .
tr	Pos	I ' d go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I wouldn ' t pay their rack rate .
tr	Pos	The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
tr	Pos	Though they are mostly excellent , you generally don ' t get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
tr	Pos	Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
tr	Pos	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
tr	Pos	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Pos	Dessert was ... hmmm , that ' s interesting , I don ' t even remember dessert .
tr	Pos	Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
tr	Pos	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
tr	Pos	Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
tr	Pos	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Pos	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you ' ve never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
tr	Pos	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Pos	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Pos	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
tr	Pos	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .
tr	Pos	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
tr	Pos	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Pos	So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
tr	Pos	"They said they were "" unable to tell me until they ordered my dress ""."
tr	Pos	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Pos	Do other brides fall for this ???
tr	Pos	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Pos	Whatever type of operation they are running , I ' m not interested and if you ' re smart , you won ' t be either .
tr	Pos	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Pos	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Pos	My point : Even if I was wrong , don ' t sit there and argue with the customer .
tr	Pos	"I didn ' t think so but you could be right ."""
tr	Pos	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
tr	Pos	Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners .
tr	Pos	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
tr	Pos	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn ' t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
tr	Pos	AWFUL SERVICE !
tr	Pos	After happily visiting Sear ' s Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
tr	Pos	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Pos	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn ' t possible .
tr	Pos	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Pos	OK , one bad experience ... fine .
tr	Pos	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Pos	I would not have gone back , but I couldn ' t find the particular tire they ' d used in stock anywhere else .
tr	Pos	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Pos	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Pos	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Pos	So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
tr	Pos	"A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that "" I "" left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car )."
tr	Pos	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Pos	Of course I couldn ' t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ).
tr	Pos	The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
tr	Pos	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Pos	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
tr	Pos	The employees at this Sear ' s are completely apathetic and there didn ' t seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
tr	Pos	I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ).
tr	Cmp	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Cmp	The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way .
tr	Cmp	Baghdadis don ' t venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more , you never know where you might get stuck .
tr	Cmp	However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
tr	Cmp	The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism , and even the threat of nuclear war , than Iraq ever did .
tr	Cmp	Of course , the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less - provocative local or international forces , the better .
tr	Cmp	Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then .
tr	Cmp	Israel , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
tr	Cmp	Worse for Israel , the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites .
tr	Cmp	The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
tr	Cmp	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
tr	Cmp	M . D . Nalapat , an expert on jihad , is professor of geopolitics at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education , India .
tr	Cmp	For example , did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry ?
tr	Cmp	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Cmp	Earlier , Kerry said , “ Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question .”
tr	Cmp	And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well .
tr	Cmp	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Cmp	Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
tr	Cmp	"Now I hide a lot less ."")"
tr	Cmp	Meiring is more than an embarrassment .
tr	Cmp	"Since the "" Sea Tigers "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
tr	Cmp	Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket - propelled - grenade launchers , 20 assault rifles , M - 79 grenade launchers and more than 10 , 000 rounds of ammunition .
tr	Cmp	India ' s Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1 , 000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal .
tr	Cmp	The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans , which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south .
tr	Cmp	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Cmp	More than ever , police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes , even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions .
tr	Cmp	"An editorial in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "" the state ' s history , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet ' s nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach lawmakers and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities ."""
tr	Cmp	Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
tr	Cmp	look up fumarase deficiency for more info .
tr	Cmp	But more and more , as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone , it has gotten to be something weirder .
tr	Cmp	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter - cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but doesn ' t apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
tr	Cmp	They want to be identified as ' Christians ', and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician ' s practice of the inversion principle .
tr	Cmp	( Don ' t wish to use Wikipedia again , it ' s just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information .)
tr	Cmp	If the load was 99 tonnes there were probably less than 20 , 000 .
tr	Cmp	Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers .
tr	Cmp	In my opinion , people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems .
tr	Cmp	They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
tr	Cmp	According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U . N ., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
tr	Cmp	The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
tr	Cmp	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
tr	Cmp	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
tr	Cmp	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
tr	Cmp	There was certainly more despair in Saddam ' s Iraq than in Paul Bremmer ' s Iraq , and no one exploded himself .
tr	Cmp	Europe , more than any other region , is the key .
tr	Cmp	( Spores must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable .)
tr	Cmp	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Cmp	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .

tr	Cmp	Otherwise , we can see who we can scare up at the office , or you can have Laura sign and I ' ll initial later .
tr	Cmp	Since it will be Janet signing , it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first .
tr	Cmp	Let me know which is easier and we can coordinate .
tr	Cmp	Otherwise , we can see who we can scare up at the office , or you can have Laura sign and I ' ll initial later .
tr	Cmp	In any case , we have had some more time to do some exploring ( and shopping ), so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come .
tr	Cmp	I ' ll talk to you later .
tr	Cmp	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
tr	Cmp	I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ).
tr	Cmp	If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
tr	Cmp	I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer .
tr	Cmp	This meeting should not take more than one hour .

tr	Cmp	I e - mailed your assistant earlier this morning and have had no response .

tr	Cmp	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .

tr	Sup	When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
tr	Sup	Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?
tr	Sup	County Kerry is the worst affected .
tr	Sup	The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
tr	Sup	Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
tr	Sup	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Sup	By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
tr	Sup	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .

tr	Sup	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).

va	Pos	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .

va	Pos	Bush also nominated A . Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals , replacing John Montague Steadman .
va	Pos	He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they didn ' t .
va	Pos	Nervous people make mistakes , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks .
va	Pos	In the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station , killing several people .
va	Pos	The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe .
va	Pos	In Fallujah , hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride .
va	Pos	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Pos	The US troops fired into the hostile crowd , killing 4 .
va	Pos	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Pos	Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company ' s story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who haven ' t heard it .
va	Pos	Usually , these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up , but this time people are actually concerned about the company ' s plans .
va	Pos	"They work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company who ' s stated goals include "" Don ' t be evil ,"" they imagine a company who ' s eventually history will be "" Don ' t be profitable ."""
va	Pos	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Pos	Read the entire article ; there ' s a punchline , too .
va	Pos	""" Arafat ' s secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky ."
va	Pos	The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
va	Pos	Arafat ' s death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled .
va	Pos	Sharon ' s assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party .
va	Pos	If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership cannot find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues .
va	Pos	Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
va	Pos	"Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror ."""
va	Pos	Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon ' s murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before .
va	Pos	"The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , "" condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq ."""
va	Pos	Ash - Sharq al - Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike .
va	Pos	US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead .
va	Pos	In Ramadi , there was a big demonstration .
va	Pos	"Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was "" criminal "" and that "" the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad ""."
va	Pos	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Pos	"This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region ,"" the message claimed ."
va	Pos	"Xinhua alleged that "" Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation ."""
va	Pos	In an apparently unrelated incidents , some eleven Iraqis were killed by snipers on Tuesday , including a group of police trainees in a bus near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk .
va	Pos	Ever since the first whispers about Google ' s IPO , most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that , even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution , the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit .
va	Pos	Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
va	Pos	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
va	Pos	The other problem ?
va	Pos	It ' s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
va	Pos	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
va	Pos	Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
va	Pos	Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
va	Pos	An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
va	Pos	Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran ' s Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
va	Pos	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Pos	This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
va	Pos	When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
va	Pos	The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
va	Pos	Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
va	Pos	Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
va	Pos	Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
va	Pos	Allawi ' s aged cousin and the man ' s wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
va	Pos	In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
va	Pos	If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
va	Pos	The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
va	Pos	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Pos	The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
va	Pos	For some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog .
va	Pos	[ Am at a conference and can ' t blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days .]
va	Pos	For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’ s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
va	Pos	At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
va	Pos	Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
va	Pos	President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
va	Pos	With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
va	Pos	But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal .
va	Pos	The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
va	Pos	It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
va	Pos	North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
va	Pos	But getting past who should get them , is who has them , and who is really close .
va	Pos	Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq .
va	Pos	America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’ s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
va	Pos	"The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U . S . citizens ( most of whom were "" dual - citizens "")."
va	Pos	Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U . S . citizen .
va	Pos	"To pander to the mythical "" Arab street "", of course ."
va	Pos	Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ).
va	Pos	In other words , those Americans were there by their own choice , mired in a situation that was totally predictable .
va	Pos	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U . S . citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
va	Pos	That ' s right , folks .
va	Pos	The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts .
va	Pos	Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
va	Pos	""" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home ,"" Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit ."
va	Pos	""" We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us ."
va	Pos	Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20 , 000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
va	Pos	Dear Nina ,
va	Pos	Here ' s a tip : Don ' t get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter - attack !
va	Pos	Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making .
va	Pos	"Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin ' s "" White House Briefing "" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ):"
va	Pos	""" Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there ' s a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President ."
va	Pos	After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
va	Pos	My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job .
va	Pos	But if -- there ' s a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
va	Pos	It ' s a Western scene by a guy named W . H . S . Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Pos	So he ' s got a -- I ' m a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
va	Pos	""" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer ."
va	Pos	That ' s a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
va	Pos	The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor .
va	Pos	Now that ' s a rambling response .
va	Pos	There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and / or acquiring Firefox .
va	Pos	It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
va	Pos	I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
va	Pos	Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
va	Pos	My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1 . 1 , 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 releases .
va	Pos	I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
va	Pos	"I just want to extend a big "" Welcome !"" to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week ."
va	Pos	"Me and the big "" G """
va	Pos	Following on the heels of Ben ' s annoucement yesterday , I thought I ' d post that I have joined Google as well .
va	Pos	Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
va	Pos	Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years ,...
va	Pos	Great to have you on board !
va	Pos	Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it ' s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
va	Pos	If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
va	Pos	In this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 .
va	Pos	Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer .
va	Pos	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Pos	They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
va	Pos	I ' m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non - Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they ' re ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
va	Pos	It ' s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
va	Pos	Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic .
va	Pos	Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go .
va	Pos	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr ' s movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
va	Pos	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
va	Pos	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
va	Pos	At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ?
va	Pos	State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
va	Pos	( Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess .)
va	Pos	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
va	Pos	The Washington Monthly ' s Who ' s Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
va	Pos	"Sept . 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept . 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "" protect Israel ,"" according to the Asian Times ."
va	Pos	I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
va	Pos	But they haven ' t been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
va	Pos	This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at .
va	Pos	There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don ' t want to fall into it .
va	Pos	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :

va	Pos	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Pos	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Pos	In other words the table is set .
va	Pos	I . E . the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
va	Pos	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .

va	Pos	Warm regards ,
va	Pos	Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ), the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala .
va	Pos	In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth .
va	Pos	But within a few short months , the village people began to notice their wells were running dry , so they complained to the corporation .
va	Pos	Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams .
va	Pos	After several years of use , we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant ' s waste sludge and is laden with cadmium , a highly toxic , cancer - causing heavy metal .
va	Pos	The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life , so the plant was shut down last week .
va	Pos	Just kidding , Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown out of India for similar crimes , as well .
va	Pos	The complaint , filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St . Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St . Thomas , now known as River Garden .
va	Pos	The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St . Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement .
va	Pos	Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation , former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees .
va	Pos	Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .
va	Pos	""" In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever ."

va	Pos	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Pos	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Pos	Outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative , considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator .
va	Pos	Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world .
va	Pos	( New Scientist Space )
va	Pos	On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
va	Pos	""" That kind of a financial incentive [...] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge ,"" Griffin said ."
va	Pos	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .

va	Pos	Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .

va	Pos	Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
va	Pos	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .

va	Pos	The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence .
va	Pos	In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
va	Pos	"Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "" unrestricted "" strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight ."
va	Pos	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Pos	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Pos	Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil .
va	Pos	Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
va	Pos	""" We ' re not happy with Hamas ' s position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians ,"" commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official ."
va	Pos	""" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda ."""
va	Pos	""" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel ' s scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure ,"" Habib said ."
va	Pos	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."
va	Pos	"Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war ."""
va	Pos	"Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire , and hopes to turn the Gaza strip "" into a vast battlefield ."""
va	Pos	Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

va	Cmp	Four months later , we were married .
va	Cmp	The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .

va	Cmp	Our extra bedroom is nicer now .
va	Cmp	Talk to you later
va	Cmp	Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go .
va	Cmp	Traders over here seem to have a lot more respect for other humans .
va	Cmp	You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem .
va	Cmp	You wish to be left in peace ... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ...
va	Cmp	This afternoon at 2 PM or later would work for us .
va	Cmp	The Roma deal looks much better .

va	Cmp	How much better does it get ?!
va	Cmp	Called to check if they had a product I ' ve been using on my dog for years ... the boy who answered the phone couldn ' t possibly have been ruder to me .
va	Cmp	No more having to drive to San Francisco for a great mani pedi .

te	Pos	What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e - mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
te	Pos	( And , by the way , is anybody else just a little nostalgic for the days when that was a good thing ?)
te	Pos	This BuzzMachine post argues that Google ' s rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we ' ve all heard before , but it ' s particularly well - put in this post .
te	Pos	Google is a nice search engine .
te	Pos	Does anybody use it for anything else ?
te	Pos	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Pos	John Donovan from Argghhh ! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah .
te	Pos	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Pos	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Pos	You have to see these slides .... they are amazing .
te	Pos	This Fallujah operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the US Military since the end of the war .
te	Pos	Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google ' s new toolbar , which , as noted in the linked article , commits just about every sin an online marketer could commit , and makes up a few new ones besides .
te	Pos	I ' m not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument
te	Pos	( You don ' t need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you don ' t need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you ' re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ).
te	Pos	However , this toolbar is really bad news .
te	Pos	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Pos	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
te	Pos	The United States doesn ' t believe the Iranian Government .
te	Pos	One can suspect the Iranian Government .
te	Pos	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
te	Pos	They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti - proliferation treaty .
te	Pos	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn ' t even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
te	Pos	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
te	Pos	Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure .
te	Pos	And can anyone use military pressure without proof ?
te	Pos	Angry crowds chanted anti - American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop . 256 , 000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday .
te	Pos	"Reuters reported that "" Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today ."""
te	Pos	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Pos	"Let aggressive ( American ) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city ' s security and safety , and ask them to lift their hands from the city ."""
te	Pos	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders .
te	Pos	Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there , since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals .
te	Pos	Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country ' s wealth and power .
te	Pos	They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .
te	Pos	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v . Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D . C . Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
te	Pos	The actual vote is a little confusing .
te	Pos	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
te	Pos	I ' ll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I ' m finished .
te	Pos	Important news such as President Bush ' s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti - gay ( update : he ' s not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
te	Pos	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Pos	It ' s just disappointing .
te	Pos	Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .
te	Pos	At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .
te	Pos	The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15 , 000 , according to analysts .
te	Pos	And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .
te	Pos	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Pos	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Pos	Which essentially sounds like he ' s worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
te	Pos	I assume his actual reason is that he ' s worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can ' t grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
te	Pos	I ' m not sure how the market will react .
te	Pos	It doesn ' t change the company ' s intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
te	Pos	On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
te	Pos	em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .
te	Pos	Because the 10 . 000 . 000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead .
te	Pos	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).
te	Pos	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Pos	Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :
te	Pos	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
te	Pos	To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria ' s promised withdrawal .
te	Pos	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."
te	Pos	This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .
te	Pos	"Over three years after 9 - 11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "" terrorist "" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts ."
te	Pos	The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
te	Pos	The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .
te	Pos	I ' ve been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .
te	Pos	This is a terrorist organization plain and simple .
te	Pos	This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80 ' s and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?
te	Pos	The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .
te	Pos	The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .
te	Pos	That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .
te	Pos	Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans .
te	Pos	"In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "" raiding forces "" in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins ."
te	Pos	"The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , "" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah ."
te	Pos	"Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral ."""
te	Pos	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .
te	Pos	"The statement said , "" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal ."""
te	Pos	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Pos	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .
te	Pos	Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti - Shiite pogroms .
te	Pos	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :
te	Pos	"U . S . Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "" war with Islamic fascists ,"" saying the term could inflame anti - Muslim tensions ."
te	Pos	U . S . officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .
te	Pos	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Pos	Which is why he didn ' t say we ' re at war with Islamic people .
te	Pos	We ' re at war with Islamic fascists .
te	Pos	"By using the word "" Islamic "" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier ."

te	Pos	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Pos	But because we don ' t want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone ' s a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it ' s ever been .
te	Pos	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Pos	This pledge is a new development .
te	Pos	Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days .
te	Pos	One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .
te	Pos	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Pos	This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush ' s aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .
te	Pos	"Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "" Afghan Arabs "" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden ."
te	Pos	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Pos	Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia ' s some 15 million citizens .
te	Pos	In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ).
te	Pos	After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .
te	Pos	Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .
te	Pos	They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .
te	Pos	They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .
te	Pos	( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ).
te	Pos	Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .
te	Pos	Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .
te	Pos	These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra .
te	Pos	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Pos	This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .
te	Pos	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
te	Pos	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Pos	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
te	Pos	The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ).
te	Pos	"Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were "" no good targets "" in Afghanistan ."
te	Pos	( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9 / 11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ??)
te	Pos	They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam ' s great white whale .
te	Pos	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Pos	Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
te	Pos	"Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet ' s hair was "" on fire "" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists ."
te	Pos	Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .
te	Pos	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
te	Pos	You also need Pakistani air space .
te	Pos	The plan was all set and could have succeeded .
te	Pos	The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .
te	Pos	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn ' t use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
te	Pos	Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .
te	Pos	Of course , you could just go in by main force .
te	Pos	Clinton tried , and tried hard .
te	Pos	sounds exciting .

te	Pos	it is to late for me to add changes .
te	Pos	By March of ' 68 the Dow had fallen to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of ' 68 .
te	Pos	A big rally then took the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of ' 73 , turning everyone bullish .
te	Pos	Think that was bad - by December of ' 74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 .
te	Pos	At that time , the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism .
te	Pos	By late 1974 investors were dizzy , they were desperate , they were wrung - out , they had left Wall Street , many for good .

te	Pos	Wei ' s Magic Cubes
te	Pos	Wei Ligang , a rising star of modern art in China , just had an exhibition in mid - July , 2005 in Hong Kong .
te	Pos	His art perfectly combines painting and Chinese calligraphy .
te	Pos	He is regarded as one of the leading Avant - Garde artist of modern calligraphy .
te	Pos	His artworks were selected and exhibited in British Museum in 2002 .
te	Pos	""" Wei has given some virtuoso performances with brush and ink , often incorporating several different techniques into a single work ,"" said Gordon S . Barrass , curator of the exhibition ."
te	Pos	"In the world of "" Wei ' s magic cubes ,"" all seem to be ingeniously planned and tricky ."
te	Pos	All are mathematical , all are linguistic .
te	Pos	In Wei ' s art , a logician could see mathematical logic , a cellist could see a ripple of nine bass notes , a country girl could see straw , and Harry Potter could see two accompanied green blazes .

te	Pos	Sure Google , although this would put it on coarse for global domination of the internet by 2014 .
te	Pos	It will be interesting to see whether or not Google will finally slay the Microsoft Goliath , who has known no major defeat and seeks to vanquish all competition .

te	Pos	""" Our plans include raising private capital to develop , build , flight test , and operate this Earth - Moon highway for the benefit of the country and the benefit of our investors ."""
te	Pos	Wise decision to go through the private sector -- NASA ' s budget may be kinda tight to fund a project like this .
te	Pos	This group does sound pretty interesting though .
te	Pos	The Lunar Transporatation Systems ( LTS ) is actually being funded by two space businessmen , Walter Kistler and Bob Citron .
te	Pos	Both of these men are heavily involved in the private sector of the space industry , and both are also involved with another space company called SPACEHAB .
te	Pos	They want to use LTS to tie into NASA ' s vision for Space Exploration , and seem pleased that the White House is moving in that direction .
te	Pos	""" We are so excited that the White House and the recent new government space policy underscores the need to involve the private sector in assisting NASA develop its plans for the new Vision for Space Exploration ,"" said Walter Kistler , LTS co - founder and Chairman ."

te	Pos	U . S . astronauts will launch to the moon on sleek , single , shuttle booster rockets and the first new upper - stage rocket this country has developed in more than a decade , NASA and the Pentagon have told the White House .
te	Pos	Lunar landers and other gear needed for extended visits to the moon will be lofted by gargantuan launchers as big as the Apollo - era Saturn 5 , the most powerful rockets ever flown .
te	Pos	It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved .
te	Pos	Although these new rockets are probably more expensive , they will be able to go at a much greater range than it ' s shuttle cousins , as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well .
te	Pos	""" NASA will initiate development of a Crew Launch Vehicle derived from space shuttle solid rocket boosters with a new upper stage for human spaceflight ,"" said the letter , signed by NASA Administrator Mike Griffin and the Pentagon ' s top space official , ex - astronaut Ron Sega ..."
te	Pos	""" NASA then plans to develop a new 100 - metric - ton - class launch vehicle derived from existing capabilities with the space shuttle external tanks and solid rocket boosters for future missions to the moon ,"" the letter said ."
te	Pos	NASA is planning on using these new shuttles to replace the current models , with industry forecasters predicting a launch as early as 2014 .
te	Pos	The new rocket design will differ slightly from it ' s predecessors , in the fact that the crew and cargo would launch separately from two different rockets each and join up in space later on .
te	Pos	Launching this way will hopefully avoid future disasters , giving more support towards NASA revisiting the stars .
