tr	Acc	Mosques are calling for donating blood , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah , most of them returned later though .
tr	Acc	What irritates me is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi ' ite clerics , we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance , and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as ' Ba ' athists ', ' Saddamites ', ' Wahhabis ', and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago .

tr	Acc	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Acc	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Acc	Despite many wrinkles , India remains a part - democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op - ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly .

tr	Acc	Look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating , yet they do .
tr	Acc	Look inside yourselves parents , is this you ?
tr	Acc	Fuck you .
tr	Acc	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .

tr	Acc	Most of us believe in crafting laws and instilling order .

tr	Acc	If sites next to you don ' t have what you want , contact your nearest comp . sources . unix archive , or the moderator .

tr	Acc	Louisiana ' s Governor Blanco urged residents to spend Wednesday in prayer and assured them the crisis would eventually be overcome .
tr	Acc	Let me add some additional info .

tr	Acc	As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .
tr	Acc	President Bush loves him .
tr	Acc	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan . 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
tr	Acc	Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .
tr	Acc	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
tr	Acc	Blessings to you .
tr	Acc	May God help us all .

tr	Acc	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
tr	Acc	Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .

tr	Acc	Very affordable ( don ' t call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
tr	Acc	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Acc	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
tr	Acc	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Acc	To warn you to stay away from this place just isn ' t enough .
tr	Acc	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
tr	Acc	Seems to me like A & E charges way more than necessary !
tr	Acc	First let me start out by saying , that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
tr	Acc	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
tr	Acc	None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
tr	Acc	The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
tr	Acc	Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .
tr	Acc	There were 3 names before us .
tr	Acc	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Acc	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
tr	Acc	Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
tr	Acc	Believe me .
tr	Acc	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Acc	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Acc	Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
tr	Acc	Thank you , Bowtie !
tr	Acc	Definitely go see them !
tr	Acc	The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ?).
tr	Acc	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Acc	Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
tr	Acc	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
tr	Acc	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
tr	Acc	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Acc	NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD .
tr	Acc	Myself and my fiance ' s identity was stolen from the office staff .
tr	Acc	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Acc	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Acc	Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
tr	Acc	Treat yourself and go -- you will go back !
tr	Acc	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that ' s a common misconception ( http :// www . consumerreports . org / health / healthy - living / beauty - personal - care / hair - loss - 10 - 08 / hair - loss . htm ).
tr	Acc	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
tr	Acc	Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
tr	Acc	The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
tr	Acc	The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
tr	Acc	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Acc	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Acc	The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi - sketchiness .
tr	Acc	Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
tr	Acc	No one will give me a date .
tr	Acc	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Acc	Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
tr	Acc	Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself .
tr	Acc	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Acc	B & B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
tr	Acc	Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ).
tr	Acc	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Nom	DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad .
tr	Nom	You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets .
tr	Nom	Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don ' t find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful .
tr	Nom	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Nom	In Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated .
tr	Nom	They also killed Shaikh Hamid ' Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit .
tr	Nom	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Nom	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Nom	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Nom	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Nom	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Nom	Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
tr	Nom	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year , which indicates they are the same people .
tr	Nom	And there is nothing we can do about it really , people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land .
tr	Nom	Most people haven ' t gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal is ).
tr	Nom	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Nom	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Nom	Speaking of Fallujah , we have only Al - Jazeera to rely on for our news from there .
tr	Nom	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al - Sahhaf .
tr	Nom	""" They are targetting ambulances "", "" American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women "", and "" They are using cluster bombs against civilians "" is all you get to hear from him ."
tr	Nom	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Nom	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Nom	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Nom	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Nom	Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story .
tr	Nom	It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
tr	Nom	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Nom	I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing .
tr	Nom	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Nom	S . and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
tr	Nom	I ' m sorry to say Elena ' s story has been revealed to be a fake .
tr	Nom	They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .
tr	Nom	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Nom	Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .
tr	Nom	It should continue to be defanged .
tr	Nom	Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there .
tr	Nom	We need an FDR in Iraq , not a Ronald Reagan .
tr	Nom	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Nom	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Nom	He could not name the others .
tr	Nom	""" Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan ?"""
tr	Nom	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Nom	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Nom	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Nom	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Nom	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Nom	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Nom	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Nom	I can ' t tell you how ominous I found Bush ' s performance in that interview .
tr	Nom	"I still remember him stuttering about "" the General ,"" unable to remember Musharraf ' s name ."
tr	Nom	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Nom	"He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with "" stability ."""
tr	Nom	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Nom	He couldn ' t tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
tr	Nom	So , one answer to Bush ' s charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
tr	Nom	I don ' t see Bush doing any of this .
tr	Nom	Have they , however , actually weakened Israeli security ?
tr	Nom	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Nom	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Nom	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Nom	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Nom	He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
tr	Nom	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Nom	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
tr	Nom	They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
tr	Nom	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Nom	Whereas Saddam Hussein ' s dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , they are now free to organize .
tr	Nom	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Nom	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Nom	For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga ' s government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
tr	Nom	"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive ,"" Muni told IPS ."
tr	Nom	But they , too , failed .
tr	Nom	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Nom	"She added that recent visits to the island by India ' s top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island ""."
tr	Nom	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Nom	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""
tr	Nom	While most U . S . secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with , few have been as brazen as Colin Powell .
tr	Nom	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Nom	India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China ( which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
tr	Nom	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
tr	Nom	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Nom	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Nom	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Nom	We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam .
tr	Nom	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Nom	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Nom	As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
tr	Nom	They don ' t let just anybody do it .
tr	Nom	Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush ' s service in the Texas Air National Guard .
tr	Nom	For example , did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry ?
tr	Nom	Before you fall for Dems ’ spin , here are the facts
tr	Nom	What do you really know about George W . Bush ’ s time in the Air National Guard ?
tr	Nom	That he didn ’ t show up for duty in Alabama ?
tr	Nom	That he missed a physical ?
tr	Nom	Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
tr	Nom	It was full - time work .
tr	Nom	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Nom	As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
tr	Nom	He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
tr	Nom	And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
tr	Nom	Did you know that ?
tr	Nom	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Nom	In fact , you were helping them solve their problem .”
tr	Nom	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Nom	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Nom	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Nom	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Nom	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Nom	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Nom	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it ’ s important or not in November .
tr	Nom	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Nom	And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush ’ s service , while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry ’ s .
tr	Nom	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty .”
tr	Nom	Earlier , Kerry said , “ Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question .”
tr	Nom	We should know as much as we can .
tr	Nom	I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week .
tr	Nom	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Nom	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5 , 000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
tr	Nom	Again there is no official written statement from Sistani ' s office confirming this allegation , which I think is intentional .
tr	Nom	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Nom	It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha ' lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
tr	Nom	Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
tr	Nom	I doubt that will be the outcome though .
tr	Nom	I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
tr	Nom	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Nom	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Nom	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
tr	Nom	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Nom	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Nom	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Nom	But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I don ' t believe the US is going anywhere so soon .
tr	Nom	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba ' athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
tr	Nom	I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
tr	Nom	"("" At first I hid a lot ."
tr	Nom	I thought the US government was looking for me .
tr	Nom	"Now I hide a lot less ."")"
tr	Nom	I can ' t imagine they wanted to do this .
tr	Nom	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Nom	And though he ' d been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
tr	Nom	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
tr	Nom	They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
tr	Nom	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Nom	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Nom	I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives .
tr	Nom	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
tr	Nom	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
tr	Nom	Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
tr	Nom	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Nom	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Nom	"Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records "" for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P . Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA ."""
tr	Nom	looks like it is rearing its head again in Louisianna ..
tr	Nom	Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church .
tr	Nom	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .
tr	Nom	We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose .
tr	Nom	If I was Rummy I ' d send Posada to Iraq to blow things up there .
tr	Nom	Now that ' s a post I can relate to .
tr	Nom	You really got me thinking , I enjoy reading this blog .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know how others feel , but I ' m definitely looking into immigration to Canada as an option .
tr	Nom	The good Ã³l US of A aint what it used to be .

tr	Nom	I also have a dating advice blog / site .

tr	Nom	I was searching for dog food info and found this post .
tr	Nom	I agree totally !
tr	Nom	How Would You Like To Know How YOU Can Live In A Beautiful NEW House That Is Custom - Designed To YOUR Specifications ......... And At NO COST To You ?
tr	Nom	You CAN Do It .
tr	Nom	And It ' s Not Hard To Do .... IF You Know HOW .
tr	Nom	The Only Catch Is That You HAVE To Have An Income ABOVE $ 21 , 000 ...... And ...... You HAVE To Follow The Easy Instructions Provided To You .
tr	Nom	It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar .
tr	Nom	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Nom	It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea .
tr	Nom	"Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy ' s Far Eastern Naval Command , now being established along with India ' s "" blue water navy ""."
tr	Nom	Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
tr	Nom	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Nom	"Since the "" Sea Tigers "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
tr	Nom	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Nom	""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell ' s Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners ,"" he said ."
tr	Nom	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Nom	Considering the islands ' huge strategic importance , it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been .
tr	Nom	In fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti - India outfits , such as the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these networks and weaken India ' s eastern flank .
tr	Nom	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Nom	A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan .
tr	Nom	Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia .
tr	Nom	Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non - Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island .
tr	Nom	He also writes for Aakrosh , India ' s defense - tied quarterly journal .
tr	Nom	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Nom	The neighbours are still interfering , but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’ s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it .
tr	Nom	All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process , but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan .
tr	Nom	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Nom	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Nom	Until then he had said Pakistan ’ s options were open .
tr	Nom	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Nom	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Nom	Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
tr	Nom	With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home .
tr	Nom	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Nom	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Nom	Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
tr	Nom	Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan ’ s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai ’ s campaign against warlords .
tr	Nom	‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters ,’’ says Barno .
tr	Nom	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .
tr	Nom	So far what they have done together has been good for us and that ’ s how we would like to keep it ’’, says Karzai .
tr	Nom	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Nom	In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections , they would be resisted .
tr	Nom	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Nom	The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
tr	Nom	Or they weren ' t eyewitnesses and are just lying .
tr	Nom	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Nom	He has never lived in a war zone .
tr	Nom	( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn ' t absent yourself from it .
tr	Nom	He was drinking .
tr	Nom	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Nom	He gave no service to anyone , risked nothing , and did not even slack off efficiently .
tr	Nom	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Nom	He clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching executions .
tr	Nom	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Nom	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Nom	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Nom	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Nom	Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
tr	Nom	But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
tr	Nom	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Nom	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Nom	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Nom	Groom was Republican Red Blount ' s scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
tr	Nom	He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
tr	Nom	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Nom	On the phone , you could hear his accent .
tr	Nom	It was a Texas accent .
tr	Nom	But he just melded with everybody .
tr	Nom	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Nom	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Nom	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Nom	Mr . MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ): Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid - evenings .
tr	Nom	Ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5 : 30 or 6 : 00 in the evening .
tr	Nom	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Nom	After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr . Bush about it .
tr	Nom	The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
tr	Nom	In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
tr	Nom	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Nom	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Nom	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Nom	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Nom	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Nom	They ' re going to talk about their kids , they ' re going to talk about football , they ' re going to talk about the weather .
tr	Nom	Mr . ARCHIBALD : I mean , at that time , I was 28 ; George would have been 25 or 26 .
tr	Nom	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Nom	I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
tr	Nom	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Nom	"And he would always laugh about that . """
tr	Nom	"But that means nothing , since they weren ' t the sort of things guys like Bush told the "" girls ""."
tr	Nom	He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him .
tr	Nom	It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .
tr	Nom	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
tr	Nom	Afraid I don ' t have time today to discuss these , but some stories need attention :
tr	Nom	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Nom	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Nom	"Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : "" It ' s unbelievable that no one can account for 200 , 000 assault rifles ."
tr	Nom	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Nom	"A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "" any weapons from Bosnia "" and added they were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia ""."
tr	Nom	"A NATO spokesman said : "" There ' s no tracking mechanism to ensure they don ' t fall into the wrong hands ."
tr	Nom	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Nom	It ' s always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration ' s harshest mainstream critics .
tr	Nom	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Nom	And it ' s guilty :
tr	Nom	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Nom	""" It was about how he could humiliate her the most ,"" prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments ."
tr	Nom	""" He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself ."""
tr	Nom	Have you sent this to congress yet ?
tr	Nom	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Nom	Maybe I ' m missing something here , but how , exactly , does one ' Loose ' 200 , 000 AK47 ' s ?
tr	Nom	I ' m sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
tr	Nom	We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming ....
tr	Nom	just go here , its simply amazing
tr	Nom	i count like 14 explosive headlines .
tr	Nom	Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
tr	Nom	I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
tr	Nom	Personally I don ' t give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
tr	Nom	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
tr	Nom	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
tr	Nom	It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child .
tr	Nom	"So we "" lost "" some weapon ?"
tr	Nom	It ' s a good thing too .
tr	Nom	We wouldn ' t want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us .
tr	Nom	They really are milking the incompetence angle though , aren ' t they ?
tr	Nom	Christ , you ' d think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots .
tr	Nom	I suppose that it ' s damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots .
tr	Nom	A country deserves the leaders it has , my friends ...
tr	Nom	('' We have three generations of martyrs : grandmothers , mothers , daughters .'')
tr	Nom	Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf , where they lived separated from their parents .
tr	Nom	When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
tr	Nom	When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
tr	Nom	Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
tr	Nom	They wanted to brainwash them and control them .''
tr	Nom	That ' s all I know ; I ' ve had nothing to do with it .
tr	Nom	""" Another generation of heavy metal has taken over , and -- sorry -- it ain ' t just about strippers and dope ."
tr	Nom	Okay , it ' s partly about strippers and dope .
tr	Nom	And we ' ll get around to that .
tr	Nom	But more and more , as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone , it has gotten to be something weirder .
tr	Nom	It ' s become a guardian of morality -- not church morality ; real morality .
tr	Nom	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Nom	You know , nature hates a void . :)
tr	Nom	i agree , Hmmmmmm .
tr	Nom	"And were the Columbine killers acting out this "" real morality "" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates ."
tr	Nom	They were death metal brainwashed fans , literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
tr	Nom	I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article .
tr	Nom	I think the jury ' s still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers .
tr	Nom	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter - cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but doesn ' t apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
tr	Nom	The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .
tr	Nom	That ' s it .
tr	Nom	I ' m firing my editor .
tr	Nom	Well , it ' s not as simple and clear cut as all that .
tr	Nom	We ' re entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio - political - spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection .
tr	Nom	I wouldn ' t wonder too hard .
tr	Nom	The answer is likely D : all of the above , due to this being a complex reality we live in .
tr	Nom	Here is a thought : When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Nom	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ""."
tr	Nom	& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old .
tr	Nom	"Since the article was specifically about "" death metal "" I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality :"
tr	Nom	They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home .
tr	Nom	It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
tr	Nom	"They ' re inseparable ,"" he says ."
tr	Nom	"Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : "" To hell with death ""."
tr	Nom	"I wholly agree , and would expand that statement to include : "" To hell with death metal ""."
tr	Nom	They are doing it deliberately .
tr	Nom	Do you really think GWB , and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth ?
tr	Nom	( I know , ignorant question ) Then why call them , or any other phonies ' Christians ', even if they themselves claim the appellation .
tr	Nom	They are merely imposters .
tr	Nom	Everything they claim is a lie , and this above all .
tr	Nom	They want to be identified as ' Christians ', and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician ' s practice of the inversion principle .
tr	Nom	We need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
tr	Nom	When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Nom	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ."""
tr	Nom	Why don ' t you state it ?
tr	Nom	( Don ' t wish to use Wikipedia again , it ' s just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information .)
tr	Nom	He blended belief systems such as Shamanism , Christianity , Buddhism , Paganism , Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil ' s vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners .
tr	Nom	Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers .
tr	Nom	""" I am , therefore I think "" :)"
tr	Nom	I went across the bay last night to attend a farmer ' s market and music event .
tr	Nom	I was amazed at the spiel they delivered .
tr	Nom	I resisted asking any questions that would have required either of them to think .
tr	Nom	It would have been too painful to watch .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know if this has been verified .
tr	Nom	I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W ' s head if he were to actually read the letter , but it is hard to picture him actually reading this letter .
tr	Nom	"As I read the letter , I considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it , vs . that of the mind of the man who once said "" Bring it on !"""
tr	Nom	They have been accumulating for years , and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever he feels like it .
tr	Nom	In scanning the whitehouse . gov site today , I noticed the following Executive Order :
tr	Nom	I can ' t believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI .
tr	Nom	I ' m wary of jumping into this fray without backup , that ' s for damn sure . :)
tr	Nom	I ' m a regular poster but for some reason blogger won ' t let me in today ... but sign me TroubleFunk .
tr	Nom	Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
tr	Nom	Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
tr	Nom	Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well ?
tr	Nom	Tronicus , if you ' re still checking this thread :
tr	Nom	I just get hung up on ' Christians ', as they ' re the dominant form where I come from .
tr	Nom	Also , I ' m quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses .
tr	Nom	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush ' s claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
tr	Nom	"I seem to remember something about ' by their works shall ye know them ."""
tr	Nom	I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
tr	Nom	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
tr	Nom	Again , I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly .
tr	Nom	These people are dangerous wether they ' re head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers '.
tr	Nom	I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non - violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it ' s important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
tr	Nom	I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US ' s local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
tr	Nom	It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi - nation corporation .
tr	Nom	It ' s a long but very worthwhile read .
tr	Nom	""" As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological "" entertainment "" in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come ."
tr	Nom	I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
tr	Nom	You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
tr	Nom	I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
tr	Nom	However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
tr	Nom	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
tr	Nom	I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non - Arab and also significant non - Moslem minorities .
tr	Nom	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
tr	Nom	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Nom	The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
tr	Nom	They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
tr	Nom	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Nom	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Nom	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Nom	A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
tr	Nom	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Nom	They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
tr	Nom	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Nom	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Nom	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
tr	Nom	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Nom	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Nom	It creates headlines .
tr	Nom	It is spectacular .
tr	Nom	It is frightening .
tr	Nom	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Nom	It is always shown on television in great detail .
tr	Nom	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Nom	We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
tr	Nom	But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
tr	Nom	Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
tr	Nom	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
tr	Nom	And it is a war !
tr	Nom	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
tr	Nom	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Nom	Aren ' t they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
tr	Nom	Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
tr	Nom	They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
tr	Nom	It never happens there .
tr	Nom	"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
tr	Nom	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Nom	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
tr	Nom	"You must go after the head of the "" Family ""."
tr	Nom	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
tr	Nom	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Nom	They kill people .
tr	Nom	It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
tr	Nom	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
tr	Nom	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Nom	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Nom	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Nom	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
tr	Nom	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Nom	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Nom	I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
tr	Nom	You will not believe your own eyes .
tr	Nom	You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
tr	Nom	She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
tr	Nom	"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and "" activist "" by the European press ."
tr	Nom	They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
tr	Nom	It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
tr	Nom	He is now being outperformed by his successors .
tr	Nom	They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
tr	Nom	Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
tr	Nom	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Nom	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Nom	The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO ' s and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
tr	Nom	You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
tr	Nom	Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
tr	Nom	Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti - democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
tr	Nom	But now we have an entire new set .
tr	Nom	Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
tr	Nom	Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
tr	Nom	Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
tr	Nom	Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
tr	Nom	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Nom	Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
tr	Nom	Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
tr	Nom	Do you shoot an arch - murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
tr	Nom	What do you do ?
tr	Nom	Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
tr	Nom	But it cannot be avoided .
tr	Nom	I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
tr	Nom	It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
tr	Nom	The picture I described here is not pretty .
tr	Nom	What can we do about it ?
tr	Nom	Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter - propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
tr	Nom	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Nom	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Nom	"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" supplies "" from expanding the tumor ."
tr	Nom	If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
tr	Nom	But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
tr	Nom	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Nom	I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre - war argument , but I can look at the post - war map of Western Asia .
tr	Nom	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Nom	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Nom	I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
tr	Nom	It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
tr	Nom	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Nom	It is ruthless .
tr	Nom	It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
tr	Nom	It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
tr	Nom	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Nom	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Nom	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Nom	When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
tr	Nom	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Nom	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Nom	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Nom	But it really does not matter .
tr	Nom	What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
tr	Nom	If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
tr	Nom	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Nom	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Nom	It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
tr	Nom	I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
tr	Nom	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Nom	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Nom	He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
tr	Nom	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Nom	It ' s just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI ' s ( former ) theory about a lone , American scientist .
tr	Nom	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Nom	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Nom	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Nom	He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader .
tr	Nom	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Nom	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Nom	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Nom	He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise .
tr	Nom	At one time , some thought he had been spotted in Iran .
tr	Nom	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Nom	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Nom	The same week , the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes , they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received .
tr	Nom	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Nom	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Nom	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Nom	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Nom	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Nom	Although the details of the documents on Mohammed ' s computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings .
tr	Nom	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Nom	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Nom	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Nom	Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning .
tr	Nom	It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui , who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology .
tr	Nom	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Nom	While it ' s not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought .
tr	Nom	They would know .
tr	Nom	According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative ' s house ).
tr	Nom	"The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda ' s "" Chemical Wire Group ."""
tr	Nom	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Nom	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Nom	He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also has received pilot training .
tr	Nom	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Nom	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Nom	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Nom	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Nom	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Nom	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Nom	Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
tr	Nom	"Most of the "" talking heads "" on television , however , knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers ."
tr	Nom	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Nom	They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman .
tr	Nom	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Nom	He reportedly treated them like sons .
tr	Nom	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""
tr	Nom	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Nom	The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
tr	Nom	At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained , recruits would wear green uniforms , except for Friday when they were washed .
tr	Nom	In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise .
tr	Nom	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Nom	What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet ?
tr	Nom	We are , after all , in this together .
tr	Nom	First , the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI is doing .
tr	Nom	"Third , with the "" new age "" Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . in charge of the investigation , it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security ."
tr	Nom	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Nom	Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets ( August Board meeting ) one more time before I forward it to you .
tr	Nom	He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc .) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
tr	Nom	Typically , we receive both FX and inflation from you , but both curves may not always be used .
tr	Nom	I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests .
tr	Nom	For now , this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and / or inflation curves .
tr	Nom	I will send the specifics per Andre later today .
tr	Nom	Puerto Rico CPI only ( I need historical inflation data , as well )
tr	Nom	Brazil we have current data already
tr	Nom	China we have current data already
tr	Nom	I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting / IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already .
tr	Nom	I have to decline the invitation with regrets .
tr	Nom	I have too many commitments right now .
tr	Nom	Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress , Risk 2001 Australia , which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001 .
tr	Nom	Have you had an opportunity to consider the invitation yet ?
tr	Nom	We are aiming to have the programme printed next week , so I would really need to know as soon as possible if you would be available to speak at this year ' s congress .
tr	Nom	I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only ( Tel : + 852 2545 2710 ), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email .
tr	Nom	Will you drive on that day ?
tr	Nom	As I mentioned in my voice mail , Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody , a recent MBA grad from Rice , into his group .
tr	Nom	However , when we were talking about this position , Mike compared Sara to Elena .
tr	Nom	Elena ' s title is admin coordinator , and I know that Sara should not have this title , and honestly do not think that Elena should also .
tr	Nom	I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah ' s duties / level to other Sr . Spec . in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent , or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad .
tr	Nom	If the latter is the case , we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33 - 66K ).
tr	Nom	I appreciate all your help .
tr	Nom	Martin ' s box is working wonderfully - I ' ll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday .
tr	Nom	We save $ 21 , 000 in real money this way , the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server , using a box that wasn ' t being used by anyone .
tr	Nom	I ' m happy about this .
tr	Nom	I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don ' t have access to now .
tr	Nom	If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds , or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S @ P , I ' d listen .
tr	Nom	We ' ll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options .
tr	Nom	At some point , I ' d like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close ?
tr	Nom	I believe ENE will continue to be range bound , but in case it is not , I don ' t want to forgo 50 % of my option premium .
tr	Nom	I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy .
tr	Nom	To that regards , I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls .
tr	Nom	I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options .
tr	Nom	I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold .
tr	Nom	Of course , you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce .
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place , but maybe @ 73 .
tr	Nom	He just rescheduled to Wednesday .
tr	Nom	are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday ?
tr	Nom	are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday ?
tr	Nom	i completely agree .
tr	Nom	I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1 - 2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything .
tr	Nom	What do you guys think .
tr	Nom	I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday .
tr	Nom	i completely agree .
tr	Nom	I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1 - 2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything .
tr	Nom	What do you guys think .
tr	Nom	Did you happen to sign your employment agreement ?
tr	Nom	He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories - in particular , Real Time Traders .
tr	Nom	If you would , please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening , if possible .
tr	Nom	I ' m at xif you have any questions .
tr	Nom	I understand all of those comparisons , however , the reality is if we lose Dean ( which we will if we don ' t pay 65k + 10k ), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75 - 80k .
tr	Nom	I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
tr	Nom	I would like to get this done ASAP .
tr	Nom	I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent .
tr	Nom	Business Case : If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $ 10 , 000 increase ( approximately 25 %) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
tr	Nom	It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted .
tr	Nom	Secondly , he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg . Paul Thomas , Jason Choate , Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai .
tr	Nom	Are we going to attend ?
tr	Nom	It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion .
tr	Nom	It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing , including market - based pricing alternatives to FERC ' s traditional pricing methods .
tr	Nom	The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system .
tr	Nom	I need to check something in 969 ' s 2000 tax return .
tr	Nom	I think that this is for you since I don ' t know any of these people .
tr	Nom	How do you feel about taking on another company ?
tr	Nom	Do you concur ?
tr	Nom	If you have not already made these decisions , Essie ' s guidance should be helpful .
tr	Nom	Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization ?
tr	Nom	If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
tr	Nom	I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group .
tr	Nom	I think this entity should stay with 83N .
tr	Nom	So I suggest it be assigned to Leon .
tr	Nom	It should be 4 - easy .
tr	Nom	I think this could go to either Holding / Administrative Companies ( Same as 17H ) or Network & Services ( Leon ).
tr	Nom	It should be assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ).
tr	Nom	I see that it is a 4 , so that will be no problem .
tr	Nom	How do you feel about taking on another company ?
tr	Nom	Do you concur ?
tr	Nom	If you have not already made these decisions , Essie ' s guidance should be helpful .
tr	Nom	Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization ?
tr	Nom	If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
tr	Nom	I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .
tr	Nom	I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
tr	Nom	They should be delivered this week .
tr	Nom	They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection .
tr	Nom	I have also purchased an Appel in the last month .
tr	Nom	I am interested in several artists .
tr	Nom	I will be looking for one or more of the following .
tr	Nom	I listed all of our ( sometimes mine vs . my wife ' s favorites and priorities ).
tr	Nom	They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
tr	Nom	I want signed and numbered .
tr	Nom	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
tr	Nom	I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive .
tr	Nom	For example , I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper .
tr	Nom	At least that is what I am thinking now .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know that he did any )
tr	Nom	By the way , I am interested in re - looking at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that your gallery had a couple of years ago .
tr	Nom	"It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling )."
tr	Nom	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20 , 000 .
tr	Nom	Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .
tr	Nom	We ' ll find time when things settle down .
tr	Nom	I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today .
tr	Nom	I may have to postpone again , I ' ll let you know later this morning .
tr	Nom	I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch .
tr	Nom	Actually , I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don ' t be too mad if I have to cancel .
tr	Nom	Please leave as a word document and make any changes and additions that you think necessary .
tr	Nom	I haven ' t even changed the wording after I first put it down .
tr	Nom	Mark , I thought you would enjoy the comment about you .
tr	Nom	I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today .
tr	Nom	I may have to postpone again , I ' ll let you know later this morning .
tr	Nom	I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch .
tr	Nom	Actually , I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don ' t be too mad if I have to cancel .
tr	Nom	I will put this on our calendars .
tr	Nom	Too bad you won ' t make the Compaq thing , but maybe next year .
tr	Nom	I can recommend some good restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday .
tr	Nom	We stayed at the Menger and had a great time .
tr	Nom	I ' ll be in around1000
tr	Nom	Most Fridays I ' m going to TRY to pick Michael up since I ' m away so much , which means leaving by 445 or so .
tr	Nom	October 19 / 20 , Neil is out of town , so I have to pick Michael up from school ( leave at 430 )
tr	Nom	Neil has a meeting in San Antonio ( usually it is in Miami , San Francisco , Phoenix - not so great this year ).
tr	Nom	It is the officer ' s meeting for Enterprise , and spouses are invited .
tr	Nom	This means we won ' t be in town for the Compaq thing .
tr	Nom	I ' m watching for some good vacation days , also ...
tr	Nom	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
tr	Nom	We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
tr	Nom	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
tr	Nom	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what ' s in the draft ?
tr	Nom	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
tr	Nom	Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract , or several ?
tr	Nom	I ' m looking for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart ' s files ( haven ' t checked closely yet ).
tr	Nom	I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project .
tr	Nom	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
tr	Nom	We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
tr	Nom	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
tr	Nom	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what ' s in the draft ?
tr	Nom	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
tr	Nom	Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract , or several ?
tr	Nom	I ' m looking for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart ' s files ( haven ' t checked closely yet ).
tr	Nom	Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed ?
tr	Nom	1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i . e ., ONSI would be a lot more money ).
tr	Nom	Hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
tr	Nom	In order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 .
tr	Nom	I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI .
tr	Nom	Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
tr	Nom	3 . I expect at least one EPC contract per project .
tr	Nom	We don ' t want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project .
tr	Nom	What are we going to get her ?
tr	Nom	I hear you are coming our way soon .
tr	Nom	When she dances she makes the band skip .
tr	Nom	When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her 13 years to live .
tr	Nom	She puts mayonnaise on aspirin . (<- clearly the winner )
tr	Nom	When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts .
tr	Nom	She has to iron her pants on the driveway .
tr	Nom	You will have to wait and see :-)
tr	Nom	I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn ' t want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis .
tr	Nom	I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say .
tr	Nom	He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality .
tr	Nom	Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive ?
tr	Nom	All the guys at work are saying I shouldn ' t bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one .
tr	Nom	I won ' t forget about the $.
tr	Nom	Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that ?
tr	Nom	Don ' t take that deal out until I look at it .
tr	Nom	I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book ( I only wrote it in my red book ).
tr	Nom	He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then .
tr	Nom	You should reply ASAP .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t get a chance to talk to Paul today .
tr	Nom	Will you please run a June NX3 / NX1 for our book .
tr	Nom	I am in the office so give me a call .
tr	Nom	Hopefully he didn ' t spel anyting incorrectly .
tr	Nom	I think he would be a good fit .
tr	Nom	I haven ' t had a chance to send it yet .
tr	Nom	Paul is out of the office today so I haven ' t had a chance to talk to him .
tr	Nom	I ' ll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not .
tr	Nom	Are you guys still looking for an analyst ?
tr	Nom	Should I send the resume to Dawn or you directly ?
tr	Nom	We should try to have a conference call with the west desk to discuss as soon as we can .
tr	Nom	I will be able to attend .
tr	Nom	Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle ' s help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
tr	Nom	We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
tr	Nom	Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
tr	Nom	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation ( big dance that she and I are committed to help with ), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion .
tr	Nom	I believe that these are three weekends in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th .
tr	Nom	So the last weekend in January would work well ( and I will need a rest from formal affairs !).
tr	Nom	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
tr	Nom	She said a shower would be grand .
tr	Nom	She has some big presentation mid - January .
tr	Nom	Should we set a date now ?
tr	Nom	Am I turning into Mother ?
tr	Nom	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Nom	On the means of delivery , I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent .
tr	Nom	With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .
tr	Nom	With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .
tr	Nom	I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .
tr	Nom	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent ' s return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .
tr	Nom	I don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .
tr	Nom	Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this , and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New .
tr	Nom	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against .
tr	Nom	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
tr	Nom	I have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so I hope that it makes sense .
tr	Nom	Since you asked for input , I hope that you don ' t mind that I gave you some .
tr	Nom	Steve , I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21 % year on year ( ie ) $ 13 . 9M from $ 11 . 5M .
tr	Nom	We have been able to keep ENA ' s direct group expenses flat year on year , we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
tr	Nom	Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
tr	Nom	I just wanted Sue to hear ( she enjoys utility bashing so much ).
tr	Nom	In some respects I don ' t think the first panel could have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for different reasons ).
tr	Nom	I apologize if I offended anyone .
tr	Nom	You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
tr	Nom	Does she have any interest in meeting one - on - one or is she just looking for a public hanging ?
tr	Nom	I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach .
tr	Nom	Given the short notice , we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday , but will let the good Senator know that , in general , we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody .
tr	Nom	Can we get some help on the IBM issues ?
tr	Nom	WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
tr	Nom	Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
tr	Nom	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Nom	The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
tr	Nom	They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .
tr	Nom	Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we can ' t and where they are ?
tr	Nom	Are whole offices ( eg Tokyo ) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices ?
tr	Nom	Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning BackWeb before we proceed .
tr	Nom	As you can see from the Design Document , they are pretty significant .

tr	Nom	I won ' t find out until Monday .
tr	Nom	You review and approve it , keep it on your desk , and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday .
tr	Nom	Then I ' ll take it to Ed for his approval .

tr	Nom	"I also deleted "" subject to recall "" based on our discussion , assuming you get approval for that revision ."
tr	Nom	You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney .
tr	Nom	Also , as I mentioned to you , we have faxed your mark - up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed .
tr	Nom	If you are not the intended recipient , please contact the sender and delete all copies .
tr	Nom	She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands .
tr	Nom	She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives .
tr	Nom	"Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles ?"""

tr	Nom	I do feel guilty about you doing all this work .
tr	Nom	So I ' m going with you , I pay for the gas and the twinkies .
tr	Nom	"We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "" wish list "" for us ."
tr	Nom	In all , we received requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event .
tr	Nom	We thought you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting , so we ' ve provided a sampling of the suggestions below .
tr	Nom	While we can ' t make any promises , we will do our best to bring in at least some of these special guests .
tr	Nom	If you have any contacts who could help us get in touch with these guest speakers , please let us know at ethink @ enron . com .
tr	Nom	I will see you in the lobby at 7am .
tr	Nom	We can meet at Hyatt Regency Downtown ( Smith Street ).
tr	Nom	Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office ?
tr	Nom	I will have to leave downtown at about 945 to catch a plane .
tr	Nom	That will ensure that I wont take up too much of your time !!
tr	Nom	I ' ll initiate the call .
tr	Nom	I shall spend an entire day at PRC ( performance review ) on Friday , July 7 .
tr	Nom	Can we do on another day
tr	Nom	I ' ll still be here in Boston so we ' d do it over the phone .
tr	Nom	Will you be in Houston on that day or we shall do it over the phone ?
tr	Nom	July 12 , 2 : 30 it is .
tr	Nom	I would like the pre - meeting site cruise .
tr	Nom	How can we arrange it ?
tr	Nom	We ' re all set for 2 : 30 on July 12 .
tr	Nom	I shall be glad to review your website -- www . weathereffects . com .
tr	Nom	I shall invite some people who work on electricity in my group to join me .
tr	Nom	I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality .
tr	Nom	I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures .
tr	Nom	I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman , Morgan , BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours .
tr	Nom	If we have time next week , I could step you through our website -- www . weathereffects . com .
tr	Nom	I ' m very proud of what we ' ve done .
tr	Nom	I can ' t give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password .
tr	Nom	It ' s a very ambitious site -- with state - of - the - art WSI weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL .
tr	Nom	After one month ' s full - bore effort , I ' m pleased with the results ( e . g ., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ).
tr	Nom	I shall be available on both days .
tr	Nom	It will be nice to see you again .
tr	Nom	P . S . By the way , did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL ?
tr	Nom	what do you think ?
tr	Nom	If possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .
tr	Nom	We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz .
tr	Nom	We would still keep the 20 , 000 , 000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement .
tr	Nom	We too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us .
tr	Nom	I am going to find out how much line we currently have available ... you probably already have this .
tr	Nom	We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line , putting us over the limit , without me knowing ...
tr	Nom	We could change the language of the POA to this ...
tr	Nom	we will not go over Global ' s piece of the Cargill line ...
tr	Nom	I think this would solve our main concern ...
tr	Nom	I am hopeful that we are ready to prepare execution copies .
tr	Nom	We look forward to your response .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know anything about these transactions .
tr	Nom	I wanted to follow up with you regarding the creation and approval of ISDA Confirmations for the following equity trades that I understand Laurel had discussed with you previously .
tr	Nom	""" Other Provisions : On each Payment Date , [ ENA ] shall pay [ a fee of ] [ an amount equal to ] USD { 38 , 000 ?], which amount shall be subject to the netting provisions of the [ Master Agreement - how do you refer to the agreement ?]"""
tr	Nom	I look forward to hearing from you .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t have a chance to speak with you after the offsite to shake your hand .
tr	Nom	Hope you enjoyed your weekend in Houston .
tr	Nom	We need to change the Prod Description fro the LME Product .
tr	Nom	I need to have a form filled out that says I don ' t have health insurance coverage through Enron .
tr	Nom	Can you find out who I need to send it to in HR ?
tr	Nom	They will be there by noon on the 20th , and the surgery will last 1 . 5 hours and then they ' ll watch him for 2 more hours before they put him into ICU .
tr	Nom	They are hoping he ' ll only be in the hospital 48 hours .
tr	Nom	I have a change in plans next week .
tr	Nom	I was planning to be on vacation anyway , but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft . Worth which I would not have had otherwise .
tr	Nom	I will manage client expectations accordingly .
tr	Nom	I hope you don ' t change your mind about going to the wedding Sunday .

tr	Nom	Yes , but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood to the brain .
tr	Nom	I hope your dad ' s surgery goes well !
tr	Nom	Is this related to the problems he is having getting around ( circulatory ?)?
tr	Nom	I have a change in plans next week .
tr	Nom	I was planning to be on vacation anyway , but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft . Worth which I would not have had otherwise .
tr	Nom	I will manage client expectations accordingly .
tr	Nom	I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information regarding some of the titles for various employees .
tr	Nom	The ones that I made changes to are in red .
tr	Nom	I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet .
tr	Nom	Please use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier .
tr	Nom	It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file is accurate , including titles , as this information is being given directly to John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen .
tr	Nom	I finally got it to blackline correctly .
tr	Nom	Here it is .
tr	Nom	If you have any problems or questions , please feel free to call me at 713 - 853 - 1696 .

tr	Nom	I do not think the prior e - mail got through to Kay .
tr	Nom	We have had no contact with the ENA / Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don ' t want to bust any structuring goals .
tr	Nom	I now understand that someone at ENA / Enron Mexico / Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC contract with ABB for this project .
tr	Nom	I am not in the office today , so please include Renee Alfaro on your response .
tr	Nom	I enjoyed your recent e - mail but was sorry to hear about your dad .
tr	Nom	It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly .
tr	Nom	As I watched my mother and father ' s health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die , it is a very defining time in our lives .
tr	Nom	But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes .
tr	Nom	He is joining an excellent company .
tr	Nom	I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA .
tr	Nom	As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable , it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can .
tr	Nom	They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires .
tr	Nom	They ' re currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami , Florida .
tr	Nom	It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney .
tr	Nom	It was a 7 lb ., 10 oz ., 20 inch little boy .
tr	Nom	So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
tr	Nom	They are a great deal of fun .
tr	Nom	We are doing quite well .
tr	Nom	"I am looking forward to seeing Ginger "" Rees "" Copeland when she comes to Houston ."
tr	Nom	I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston .
tr	Nom	I hope you have a great summer .
tr	Nom	Unfortunately , do to Mr . Lay ' s schedule he will not be able to participate .
tr	Nom	Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work .
tr	Nom	I want to check with Mr . Lay before confirming .
tr	Nom	As you know , our next meeting is on Wednesday , July 12 from 3 : 00 - 5 : 30 p . m .
tr	Nom	In the next week or so , we ' ll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues , and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it .
tr	Nom	There are three possible dates for the meeting , which I suggest be in two parts -- first , a meeting among the panel only from 5 : 00 - 6 : 30 p . m ., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6 : 30 - 8 : 30 p . m .
tr	Nom	Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for you :
tr	Nom	Here is the link to the latest commercial laptops on the market , I will follow up with the consumer models .
tr	Nom	Unfortunately , Mr . Lay will be in San Jose , CA participating in a conference , where he is a speaker , on June 14 .
tr	Nom	I hope that you will be able to attend that event .
tr	Nom	Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress in Education in Texas over the past decade .?
tr	Nom	Now it is time to take the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education system .
tr	Nom	I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th .

tr	Nom	I ' ll take TCO pool at Index and sale Leach or Pool at Index - $. 04 .
tr	Nom	I can ' t remember if you guys could do it or not .
tr	Nom	Could you tell me what deal tickets you are seeing ?
tr	Nom	Actually it is not a new truck .
tr	Nom	Oh , it is dueled out through one catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound .
tr	Nom	I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well .
tr	Nom	I gave $ 16 , 900 + tax .
tr	Nom	It is very clean and is Sandalwood , Driftwood or something of that nature in color .
tr	Nom	I have to pick up old gray over at Jerry ' s .
tr	Nom	Debbie said , it is going to be hard on me to sale my old dodge truck .
tr	Nom	I said Yep , had that truck longer than I have had most of my women .
tr	Nom	I really need to engage brain before articulating !
tr	Nom	I am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before rain .
tr	Nom	Needs to go to $ 41 and then I will be happy .
tr	Nom	I spoke with Gerald and he said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad ' s place .
tr	Nom	We need to change the lock and place posted signs at the gate .
tr	Nom	I may want to put some steers or heifers up there .
tr	Nom	I am going up soon and having the tractor fixed .
tr	Nom	Reggie said he will pay us soon .
tr	Nom	He also still wants the tractor if we can hold on to it .
tr	Nom	We ' re set for 11 / 01 / 01 .
tr	Nom	It was sure beautiful coming up last night .
tr	Nom	We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket and watch for the space shuttle .
tr	Nom	I had a couple of hickies on my neck the day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns .
tr	Nom	She still has some sort of scholarship but I am not for sure how much it pays .
tr	Nom	She is going to be a kinesiologist , sports injury therapist .
tr	Nom	I think she just wants to be able to touch football players legs .
tr	Nom	She will be 20 on 11 / 03 .
tr	Nom	I am really proud of her .
tr	Nom	You should e mail her sometimes .
tr	Nom	I am sure she would like to hear from you .
tr	Nom	You should have listened to Maw , as long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped , you will be alright .
tr	Nom	I am half way through the first and you can borrow it when I am through .
tr	Nom	I sure like his style of writing .
tr	Nom	I understand you have a brand new truck .
tr	Nom	I need 2 things from you .
tr	Nom	1 . I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to change it over to you name .
tr	Nom	What do you think ?
tr	Nom	If that ' s ok , how do you want your name to show up on the title and what address should I use ?
tr	Nom	2 . I ' m getting ready to divy up the Dow stock .
tr	Nom	How many of Dad ' s shares do you have ?
tr	Nom	I thought we only had cashout , at most 3 times , before this June .
tr	Nom	I can ' t remember .
tr	Nom	I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year .
tr	Nom	I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico .
tr	Nom	Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000 - Dec 2000 ?
tr	Nom	I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced .
tr	Nom	I can ' t get through on the phones .
tr	Nom	I ' m checking my emails .
tr	Nom	I assume you have your anwser and don ' t need me .
tr	Nom	I sent this to Mary last week .
tr	Nom	She may be out because in the past she always responds pretty quick .
tr	Nom	I need the prices below .
tr	Nom	Can you help out ?
tr	Nom	I need your help again .
tr	Nom	I need prices for May , June , and July .
tr	Nom	Can you please review this additional language to the risk management policy ( or circulate to Jeff Hodge )?
tr	Nom	In light of the CA regarding curves , I am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples unlimited access to information .
tr	Nom	I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have .
tr	Nom	I ' m still at home .
tr	Nom	I ' ll be in tomorrow .
tr	Nom	I have a fax machine at home , though , if you prefer .
tr	Nom	Otherwise , we can see who we can scare up at the office , or you can have Laura sign and I ' ll initial later .
tr	Nom	Which do you prefer ?
tr	Nom	Are you in the office to initial signature pages today ?
tr	Nom	I know that Jeff is in Portland .
tr	Nom	If Jeff is happy , I ' m happy .
tr	Nom	I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights .
tr	Nom	However , he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron ' s interests .
tr	Nom	Therefore , I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written .
tr	Nom	Otherwise , I will be sending it to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning .

tr	Nom	I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have .
tr	Nom	It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn ' t know anything about it and get them to initial it .
tr	Nom	I can print it here , initial it , and fax it to whomever you want .
tr	Nom	Plus , I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that , instead of having a lawyer she hasn ' t dealt with initial it .
tr	Nom	She is very conscientious about what she signs , and who initials what .
tr	Nom	Where and to whom do you want it faxed ?
tr	Nom	Since it will be Janet signing , it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first .
tr	Nom	I ' m still at home .
tr	Nom	I ' ll be in tomorrow .

tr	Nom	I ' m working on it now .
tr	Nom	Maybe we ( Enron ) could review it tomorrow morning , then send it to FCE .
tr	Nom	I can meet around 10 : 00 .
tr	Nom	That way , we can get it to them in time for weekend review .
tr	Nom	It was good to hear from you !
tr	Nom	We had a nice Thanksgiving here too .
tr	Nom	It ' s funny , because usually it ' s just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia doesn ' t really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me !), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
tr	Nom	It was good having the girls down .
tr	Nom	"We played a new version of Uno called "" African Uno "" that was complex , fast and at times , physically challenging ."
tr	Nom	It ' s not for the meek .
tr	Nom	It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
tr	Nom	She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses ( when you play you ' ll see why you can know everyone elses hands !).
tr	Nom	I expect Craig didn ' t want Mom to see his place because it was messy .
tr	Nom	I think compared to my house , he ' s embarrased about his apartment .
tr	Nom	Then , also , he ' s got so much stuff in there right now , that I don ' t know how he ' s going to fit baby stuff .
tr	Nom	They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don ' t want 3 people in that small apartment .
tr	Nom	So he ' s going to have to start looking for another place .
tr	Nom	I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
tr	Nom	You ' ll have to come visit to check out my new house .
tr	Nom	It ' s got its own bathroom and tv , and is pretty cozy .
tr	Nom	As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes , if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn ' t tell by his voice .
tr	Nom	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Nom	But , I guess , it ' s a start ...
tr	Nom	I ' ve already made my XMAS plans .
tr	Nom	I leave the evening of the 21st , my flight comes in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am .
tr	Nom	It ' s good chatting with you .
tr	Nom	"I don ' t understand , what do you mean by "" log in an email ""?"
tr	Nom	Anyway , I got you message , and I got the World Series thing ( although I had already received
tr	Nom	Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving , I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I ' ve ever had ( I not gonna tell them that , I don ' t want them getting swell heads ).
tr	Nom	Ma said she had a great time in Houston , She was happy to see yourself , as well as C & D .
tr	Nom	I think she likes her special room in your house .
tr	Nom	Your gonna be the first to see the new baby ( woudn ' t it be wierd if the baby gets botn on Jan 5th ?)
tr	Nom	What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben ( he was almost shocked )?
tr	Nom	Are you coming for Xmas ?
tr	Nom	Hey , Mr . Computer , you can ' t log an email in to your sister ?!
tr	Nom	You can take my assistant Taffy Milligan off these emails again .
tr	Nom	If so , I ' ll get it signed by Craig Breslau today , then bring it to you for countersignature .
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure you have the authority to sign documents w / o special authority ...
tr	Nom	No , it does not mean that .
tr	Nom	If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
tr	Nom	"With respect to Deutsche Bank ("""" DB ""), we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
tr	Nom	With respect to First Union National Bank , the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11 / 8 / 00 for review .
tr	Nom	can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of .
tr	Nom	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co - signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we ' re OK .
tr	Nom	The referenced TAGG # was entered as a ' New Counterparty ', can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure .
tr	Nom	Thank you ,
tr	Nom	Sorry I haven ' t written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated .
tr	Nom	I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don ' t think I ' m going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
tr	Nom	As much fun as they are , I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them .
tr	Nom	As for Ted , things are still going well although I haven ' t see him at all this week ( we are two very busy people ).
tr	Nom	But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
tr	Nom	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Nom	Anyway , I ' m sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
tr	Nom	Hopefully , if we ' re still dating come December , you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit .
tr	Nom	I ' m planning on dragging him to at least one of the U . T . games , I just have to find out when he wants to go ( as well as properly prepare him for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that is a U . T . game ).
tr	Nom	"I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" Rent "" and it was wonderful ."
tr	Nom	Also , I ' m going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot ' s daughter Julie .
tr	Nom	Needless to say I am very excited .
tr	Nom	Talk to you guys soon ,
tr	Nom	How are you doing ?
tr	Nom	Are you really ?
tr	Nom	Would you come with your parents or separately ?
tr	Nom	In any case , we have had some more time to do some exploring ( and shopping ), so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come .
tr	Nom	I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
tr	Nom	We ' ll do whatever you want want if you still are coming !
tr	Nom	Do You Yahoo !?
tr	Nom	The play was very good and I think well received .
tr	Nom	I ' d forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
tr	Nom	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling ).
tr	Nom	I caught the third day of Corey ' s Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job !).
tr	Nom	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Nom	As a result of that , she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me ( The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia ).
tr	Nom	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn ' t spell her name right in the email - I mean it ' s such a common spelling .
tr	Nom	She ' s a very fun girl .
tr	Nom	-- Due to the lack of response yesterday , I ' m beginning to worry about your success with the road test ...
tr	Nom	I ' m going to assume that you didn ' t get around to it .
tr	Nom	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Nom	I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
tr	Nom	I ' ll talk to you later .
tr	Nom	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
tr	Nom	I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully .
tr	Nom	At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things .
tr	Nom	Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have established , I have the memory of an elephant ).
tr	Nom	I ' ll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
tr	Nom	Now back to what ' s really important ... you .
tr	Nom	Thought you ' d like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec . 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it ' s all about you and your needs .
tr	Nom	I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam both written and on the rode .
tr	Nom	This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire .
tr	Nom	I know I need some of your organizational skills .
tr	Nom	I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ).
tr	Nom	As we discussed , the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue :
tr	Nom	Please call if you want to discuss .
tr	Nom	If you are not the intended recipient , please delete the e - mail and notify us immediately .
tr	Nom	The least we can do is pass this news along .
tr	Nom	Is there anyone else we should tell ?
tr	Nom	fyi ... it sound like Bobby is in serious condition .
tr	Nom	I think they ' ll send us another update once he ' s out of emergency and into a room .?
tr	Nom	Then it ' s real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number .? The address is below .?
tr	Nom	It doesn ' t sound like he can receive visitors yet .
tr	Nom	Do you know the address to send cards ??
tr	Nom	Do you know if Bobby can see visitors ??
tr	Nom	Thought you might like to know .
tr	Nom	Bobby is a member of a bicycle team , while cycling this weekend , he and other members of his team were injured by a truck .?
tr	Nom	He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub Hospital .?
tr	Nom	He cannot accept calls , visits or flowers at this time , since he is in the emergency room .?
tr	Nom	I think it ' s a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ).
tr	Nom	We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages ( like the homepage ).
tr	Nom	Can you offer comments / concerns / guidelines ?
tr	Nom	Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires ?
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually , I ' m sure I don ' t have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me .
tr	Nom	We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL implementation .
tr	Nom	We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others .
tr	Nom	We would like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually .
tr	Nom	They wish to launch on Sept . 1 - meaning we will need to be sending mailings sometime around mid - August .
tr	Nom	Just wanted to know were we stand on the ETA and PA for Argentina ?
tr	Nom	If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know where this stands officially ( I haven ' t heard any developments since Amsterdam ) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want .
tr	Nom	We should include ISDA energy definitions , CFTC matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in North America .
tr	Nom	I might also add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power trading form .
tr	Nom	I am thinking 4 slides at the most .
tr	Nom	Is that what you want ?
tr	Nom	Days away : Sept . 21 through Oct . 3 ( assuming you work on the day we leave and go back to work the day after we return )
tr	Nom	I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI ( based in London ).
tr	Nom	Unfortunately , I can ' t forward your message to him directly ( there seems to be a problem with the attachment ).
tr	Nom	"If you still have it , can you send it to him at "" Mark EI . London Taylor ""?"
tr	Nom	I will take care of it .
tr	Nom	Please send the draft to Troy Black and he will forward to the CP .
tr	Nom	I left you a voice mail on Friday .
tr	Nom	I looked at the UEComm Master and had some comments -- such as our name is wrong , the cross default threshold for us should be US $ and not AUD , and there were a few other questions I had .
tr	Nom	Could you please send an executable version of the contract to Fred , David , John and me tomorrow ?
tr	Nom	If they ' re OK with it , we ' d like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections .
tr	Nom	I have inserted the company details of Uecomm as requested .
tr	Nom	I have also amended the timeframes in the Credit Support Annex to 10 days instead of 2 days .
tr	Nom	I have tracked all changes for ease of reference .
tr	Nom	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call .
tr	Nom	"We ' ve been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "" Babies Elliott "" had arrived ."
tr	Nom	Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size , and that Mom is doing well .
tr	Nom	I know you all are going to have so much fun with them .
tr	Nom	Hope you ' ve been storing up sleep , cause it looks like you won ' t be getting much for a while .
tr	Nom	These three little ones don ' t realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad , but I ' m sure they ' ll find out soon .
tr	Nom	This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday , 6th July , to our triplets :
tr	Nom	"Although small , they are all "" fully functioning "" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care ( and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks ) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights ."
tr	Nom	Attached are the fax cover pages for each of the Nylon and Polykron Deemed ISDAs I just sent you .
tr	Nom	I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts .
tr	Nom	I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer .
tr	Nom	I am following up regarding the status of our comments to the form of guaranty for Pemex that you provided to Lucy Ortiz .
tr	Nom	We look forward to hearing your comments .
tr	Nom	I received this draft from Niagara Mohawk Marketing , Inc . for our review .
tr	Nom	Will you pass along to the appropriate person ?
tr	Nom	Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann , I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $ 8M each : one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f / b / o Enron , and one by Enron Inc . f / b / o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing .
tr	Nom	I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $ 10M for each party , but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly .
tr	Nom	After you have had the chance to review the attached , please send me a marked - up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there .
tr	Nom	Should you have any questions , feel free to call me .
tr	Nom	I can be reached at 315 - 460 - 3344 .
tr	Nom	I look forward to hearing from you .
tr	Nom	Did you get a chance to find those GTC ' s for ENA that you can forward this way ?
tr	Nom	Thanks , I know you are busy .
tr	Nom	I am putting the credit worksheet on the fax machine to you as soon as I send this message .
tr	Nom	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
tr	Nom	Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end )?
tr	Nom	If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
tr	Nom	I ' m now looking closely at the option liquidation problems .
tr	Nom	I believe that there might be a sign - flipping problem for PUTS that ' s causing this whole issue .
tr	Nom	I ' ll keep you posted .
tr	Nom	I ' ll get back to you as soon as I have more info ( hopefully later today )
tr	Nom	The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608 .
tr	Nom	I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $ 65 puts are in the money and the $ 75 call is also in the money .
tr	Nom	I don ' t want to wait till month end , let ' s adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order , lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts .
tr	Nom	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .

tr	Nom	unable to attend at that time due to a prior appointment , I can meet with you individually later some time
tr	Nom	OK , now that I ' ve got your attention - I really am offering free lunch !
tr	Nom	I would like to informally get together with you on Wednesday , July 18 at 11 : 45 am - 1 : 00 pm ( max ) to talk about your recruiting experience with Enron Canada .
tr	Nom	We ' re gearing up for our 2001 / 02 recruiting campaign and we think your experience will help us define what works best and what can be improved in our process .
tr	Nom	However , if you can wait til 2 : 00pm to eat , go ahead and grab something and expense it !
tr	Nom	We ' ll hook you guys in by videoconference .
tr	Nom	I ' ve booked Videoconference Room # 1 .
tr	Nom	I propose we have a conference call with Bob Fagan on Fri July 20 at 1 : 00 pm Calgary time to discuss any areas of concern / confusion you may have .
tr	Nom	Attached is the letter I originally sent to you on May 10 in this regard .
tr	Nom	This draft reflects the changes we discussed during our call the other day .
tr	Nom	I ' ve also included a redlined draft showing changes .
tr	Nom	With reference to Article 5 , section 5 . 1 ( b ), are we going to propose an alternative planned outage to TAU for next year ?
tr	Nom	We will be targeting to raise at least $ 100 , 000 so company contributions will range from $ 10 , 000 -$ 20 , 000 per person ($ 10k minimum per person ) depending on the number of respondents .
tr	Nom	We have already received firm commitments from 3 companies .
tr	Nom	If you are interested in attending please e - mail me as soon as possible .
tr	Nom	We need responses or direction by no later than COB on Monday , October 30 , 2000 .
tr	Nom	Everyone is extremely pleased that you ' re joining .
tr	Nom	I ' ll believe it when I see it .
tr	Nom	I ' m glad they want to follow - up with Steve ( I ' ve been pushing it ) and I ' ve got some follow - up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post - call .
tr	Nom	I ' ll be in Portland but can call you .
tr	Nom	FYI , we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with Sue and Robbie et al .
tr	Nom	They indicated they could use Steve ' s help face to face at some point .
tr	Nom	We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues , case law and MSA self - certification language , and let me know if you have additional items .
tr	Nom	We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the CPUC .
tr	Nom	Also , can you confirm the correct names , email addresses , titles for those new folks on Friday ' s call : Robbie Rossi , Michelle , Melissa Lloyd ?
tr	Nom	Yes , I would like to participate .
tr	Nom	I have asked for 4 outside ports and should anyone else need to join in , they may do so with the access code and without operator assistance .
tr	Nom	Because a number of the declarations and signature pages are not yet available electronically , they have not been included with this note .?
tr	Nom	Additional printed copies should be available within the next day or so and I will make them available to all of you - just let me know how many copies you need .
tr	Nom	I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement process .?
tr	Nom	You have all devoted considerable time , resources and spirit in the preparation of this document - and it shows .?
tr	Nom	We now have a settlement before the Commission that includes ratepayer advocates , commercial and industrial customers , electric generators , marketers , shippers , independent storage providers ,? gas suppliers ,? producers , utilities , aggregators , pipeline companies , wholesale customers , municipalities , and retail mass marketers , among others .?
tr	Nom	While we should be proud of our accomplishment , we now must turn to the task of getting our testimony ready by May 5 deadline .?
tr	Nom	Assignments have already been made and I will schedule a conference call later this week to discuss related details .?
tr	Nom	Have distributed to Western GA team ( plus Steffes ) for comment and thought you may have some , too .
tr	Nom	As we discussed yesterday , Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday .
tr	Nom	We ' ll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S . D . last week .
tr	Nom	You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product .
tr	Nom	You still considering it ?
tr	Nom	Sandi sez it ' s actually happening at 10 AM and it ' s renewable - focused .
tr	Nom	As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
tr	Nom	Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
tr	Nom	Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ), I ' d say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
tr	Nom	However , if you use a particular logo for the on - line service , that should be registered .
tr	Nom	I hope the above is clear .
tr	Nom	If you could respond to me on this request , thanks
tr	Nom	I ' m @ X37047 .
tr	Nom	"I believe we are to some extent already protected with "" Enron "" proceeded with anything , but EnronOnline ( TM ) , etc . just affords us more protection ."
tr	Nom	"I assume this is akin to why McDonald ' s trademarks "" Mc "" Everything ?"
tr	Nom	Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking ?
tr	Nom	"i . e . Are we covered if we proceed a word with "" Enron ""?"
tr	Nom	If we are covered , then was it necessary to register EnronOnline ?
tr	Nom	It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal rules .
tr	Nom	If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system ; you should not copy the message or disclose its contents to anyone .
tr	Nom	For banks incorporated in a non - approved jurisdiction , it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction ( i . e . U . S . and U . K . branches ).
tr	Nom	Yes , we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and / or Commodity Contracts and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act ( Alberta ), Securities Act ( British Columbia ) and Securities Act ( Ontario ).
tr	Nom	You are the best !
tr	Nom	Why does it always have to be my deals ...?!!!
tr	Nom	We ' ve received a personal invitation to a NYMEX Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 5 : 00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan .
tr	Nom	It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend .
tr	Nom	Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation ...
tr	Nom	We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas , which adds the Canadian Securities Representation , so we don ' t have to add the rep into every confirm .
tr	Nom	I am going to count it as signed , since BC Gas has signed , but we still need it to be signed by ECC .
tr	Nom	Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me .
tr	Nom	We have received the executed Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade , Inc . dated March 2 , 2000 .
tr	Nom	It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on , and you probably didn ' t see them at first .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up .
tr	Nom	When you have a minute , I ' ll give me a call and I ' ll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel .
tr	Nom	I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives , and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London .
tr	Nom	I communicated that to Bob Bowen .
tr	Nom	He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business .
tr	Nom	Carol , will you handle this or Mark ?
tr	Nom	i ' m a gas trader on the west desk and one of my customers had some issues with our electronic trading agreement .
tr	Nom	could you take a look at this and give me an update .
tr	Nom	Torrey , as promised I have attached ARCO ' s suggested revisions to the Enron online trading agreement .
tr	Nom	I look forward to working toward a mutually satisfactory agreement in this new and thorny area of e - commerce contracting .
tr	Nom	We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1 , 1999 .
tr	Nom	Confirmation Desk : you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now .
tr	Nom	I just got a call from Dave and Frank and they tell me I have a whole week this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade Australian financial power .
tr	Nom	I ' ll need to talk to you about his Monday .
tr	Nom	Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .
tr	Nom	Consequently I need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the following :
tr	Nom	I will discuss with AA the following
tr	Nom	We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .
tr	Nom	I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval
tr	Nom	Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
tr	Nom	I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April
tr	Nom	If you have any questions please call me on x34703
tr	Nom	I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application .
tr	Nom	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year .
tr	Nom	I understand how competitive the process has become , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , personality , extracurricular activities , etc . that this would compensate for my disability .
tr	Nom	After talking with Professors Titman , Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for .
tr	Nom	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Nom	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level .
tr	Nom	I also plan on retaking the GMAT test .
tr	Nom	I would like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you .
tr	Nom	If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .
tr	Nom	I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program .
tr	Nom	I understand that it is a competitive process , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , extracurricular activities , etc ., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate for my disability .
tr	Nom	I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Nom	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level .
tr	Nom	I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test .
tr	Nom	It has been a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future .
tr	Nom	Also , if you can think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .
tr	Nom	I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program .
tr	Nom	I understand that it is a competitive process , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , extrcurricular activities , etc ., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability .
tr	Nom	I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Nom	I plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level .
tr	Nom	I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test .
tr	Nom	Also , I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an Energy - Finance Private Equity Fund at UT .
tr	Nom	I know that with my industry - wide and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund .
tr	Nom	I am very interested in energy - finance and think that your idea is a very good .
tr	Nom	It has been a pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future .
tr	Nom	Also , if you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .
tr	Nom	Sorry about that , I was working on the Teco O & M costs .
tr	Nom	I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
tr	Nom	Will we be valuing / booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options ?
tr	Nom	What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub ?
tr	Nom	What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra - day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols )?
tr	Nom	What expiration date are you using , i . e .: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?
tr	Nom	What correlation are you assuming , 15 % flat for twenty years ?
tr	Nom	Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option ?
tr	Nom	"Are you using the "" SPRDOPT "" Exotic Options function to value the option ?"
tr	Nom	Are you using the $/ MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike ?
tr	Nom	Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC ' s goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
tr	Nom	Randy , this is the issue I left you the voice mail on .
tr	Nom	"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to "" work in good faith with CDEC "" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC ' s system ."
tr	Nom	"We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "" assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses "" associated with the manual system ."
tr	Nom	"We will fight with them about who owes the $ 200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "" assist "" us in managing the cost ."
tr	Nom	In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .
tr	Nom	Do we have someone who is watching this out there ?
tr	Nom	We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected , but let me know what we can do .
tr	Nom	James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info . from CDEC .
tr	Nom	That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS , but it that ' s what they are saying , let me know and we can figure out a solution .
tr	Nom	Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management .
tr	Nom	We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200 , 987 . 33 for the period of July through September .
tr	Nom	Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , that I have not been able to review yet .
tr	Nom	This cost is averaging $ 79 , 000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September .
tr	Nom	Good point , but I ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .
tr	Nom	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .
tr	Nom	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?
tr	Nom	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
tr	Nom	After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we ' ve done .
tr	Nom	If there are any objections you need to get back to me ASAP .
tr	Nom	In discussion with Dave , we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers .
tr	Nom	However , as you will see , the questions I thought of got kinda long - but I think we need answers for all of them .
tr	Nom	One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I ' ve listed .
tr	Nom	Here it is .
tr	Nom	It incorporates Mr . Stojic ' s and Mr . Kelly ' s initial comments .
tr	Nom	Lou , do we have any sort of policy on requests like this ?
tr	Nom	Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair ( she only wanted one , however ).
tr	Nom	This particular chair is designed to help with back problems , which she has .
tr	Nom	Many people at Enron already have this type of chair , but we rarely , if ever , have a surplus because they are so popular .
tr	Nom	sorry , i left lou off of the message .

tr	Nom	I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM ' s spies intercepted .
tr	Nom	She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him .
tr	Nom	Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer ' s duplicity , but after tempers cooled , MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response .
tr	Nom	As it stands , MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers .
tr	Nom	Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he ' s on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation .
tr	Nom	Yea -- it was outstanding news !
tr	Nom	Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC ?
tr	Nom	There have been some issues with getting everything coordinated lately and I wanted to make sure that we knew who was on point .
tr	Nom	Am I scheduled to attend ?
tr	Nom	Following the Board meeting on Wednesday , you are invited to join with members of the DISCO Forum for a Wednesday evening reception and dinner , including a guest speaker .
tr	Nom	However , we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel .
tr	Nom	To reserve one of these rooms , you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group .
tr	Nom	If you should decide to arrange lodging at a different hotel , please do so quickly as there is limited availability in all surrounding hotels .
tr	Nom	We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to members of the DISCO Forum on July 20 .
tr	Nom	If you have any questions or require any assistance at all , please contact Hope Duncan at 202 . 739 . 0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703 . 729 . 2710 .
tr	Nom	We are looking forward to seeing you on September 12 .
tr	Nom	If so , I will handle it .
tr	Nom	We are receiving invoices from Ace Federal Reporters for transcripts of the recent FERC settlement conferences .
tr	Nom	Linda Robertson says they should be charged to Jim Steffes ' cost center , etc .
tr	Nom	Do you want me to send the invoices to you ?
tr	Nom	I ' m in all week .
tr	Nom	Can we visit about what went on with Ursula at the PRC meeting when you catch up ?
tr	Nom	Please disregard and destroy the form you received on July 2 , as well as any blank forms retrieved from the PEP system prior to that date .
tr	Nom	Can we have a meeting this week ( maybe Thursday at 3 : 30 ) to discuss this ?
tr	Nom	We do need a formal plan .
tr	Nom	We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions .
tr	Nom	We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
tr	Nom	Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
tr	Nom	Thane and I also visited with him .
tr	Nom	( Even though he has bigger things to do in D . C ., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas , the repercussions could be global .)
tr	Nom	We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised .
tr	Nom	The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom .
tr	Nom	I will be on a plane to Houston at 8 : 00 a . m .
tr	Nom	Can we find another time that works for us to meet ?
tr	Nom	I am available after Rick ' s Friday budget meeting ... are you available then ?
tr	Nom	You are right , we do need a formal plan , Thane has started an initial draft .
tr	Nom	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Nom	Jean and Thane , I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation .
tr	Nom	I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am .
tr	Nom	I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick ' s budget meeting .
tr	Nom	You may want to discuss with Becky .
tr	Nom	As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago , we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities , and possibly electric activities , in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders .
tr	Nom	We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order , filing , etc . with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information .
tr	Nom	This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting .
tr	Nom	Many details remain to be worked out , but we will keep you advised .
tr	Nom	In the meantime , could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues ?
tr	Nom	What do I need to do ?
tr	Nom	I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems .
tr	Nom	I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston .
tr	Nom	I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview .
tr	Nom	I enjoyed your presentation , and meeting you briefly afterwards , at the SIAM Workshop last Friday .
tr	Nom	I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and development of modeling and simulation software products , mostly for the oil and gas pipeline industry .
tr	Nom	I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and mathematical skills .
tr	Nom	Please consider whether I might fit in your group .
tr	Nom	I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email .
tr	Nom	Sorry I guess I didn ' t read it very well .
tr	Nom	It ' s ok with me .
tr	Nom	I will be completing my tour of duty in Bolivia in September of this year .
tr	Nom	I am talking to a number of people regarding opportunities for a new assignment back in Houston office .
tr	Nom	Thought since I will be in Houston , stop by your office for few minutes .
tr	Nom	What is the subject matter you wish to visit about ?
tr	Nom	I will be in Houston on May 11th and would like to visit with you in early afternoon if possible .
tr	Nom	I figured this posting belonged to one of you .
tr	Nom	I have recently been made aware of a help desk analyst job # 0000108806 that has become available in your department .
tr	Nom	I am currently employed with the aviation department ( hangar attendant ) of enron and would like to use my past knowledge and experience to persue my goals in the technology feild .
tr	Nom	I am asking respectfully if you could give me a recommendation or referral to ETS technology department .
tr	Nom	Anything you could do to help further my goals would be appreciated .
tr	Nom	I have contacted the relevant people of your interest in the job .

tr	Nom	We would like to pursue an offer to Rick Fehl prior to the next Executive Committee meeting on May 7 , 2001 .
tr	Nom	You will find attached the recommendation letter and his resume .
tr	Nom	They will be distributed on a business basis first , then personal use .
tr	Nom	It will give us some weekend reading !
tr	Nom	I expect to send them out to you sometime tomorrow .
tr	Nom	Since Debbie is a client too , I think I ' ll just mail them to your home unless you prefer otherwise .
tr	Nom	Please indicate below whether or not you plan to attend this meeting and through what medium .
tr	Nom	Yes , I will attend in person _______
tr	Nom	No , I will not attend _______
tr	Nom	Unfortunately Debbie and I will not be able to attend due to previous committments .
tr	Nom	With divisions , EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below .
tr	Nom	When the company is set up in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP ID .
tr	Nom	It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
tr	Nom	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."
tr	Nom	are you the right lawyer to look at this ?
tr	Nom	"We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include , "" a division of Cargill Incorporated ""."
tr	Nom	We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty .
tr	Nom	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Nom	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .
tr	Nom	I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and , if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure , please let me know .
tr	Nom	( Although , we have broken that rule for Legal in the past .)

tr	Nom	I ' ll be in town through Sunday morning .
tr	Nom	Any chance we can get together for dinner Saturday eve .?
tr	Nom	I ' m handling the afternoon -- I think that Harry has this morning .
tr	Nom	Can you cover for me today ?
tr	Nom	I am in mediation .
tr	Nom	I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher , as well , just to make sure it is handled .
tr	Nom	Do we have 2 sessions today ?
tr	Nom	If so , you may want to split and cover .
tr	Nom	I will take you next one in August .
tr	Nom	I got this .
tr	Nom	I assume this is 12 : 30 Central Time ?
tr	Nom	What do you think ?
tr	Nom	After that , what do we do ?
tr	Nom	After a conversation with Ryan Seleznov I herewith like disclose in writing my intentions in respect to Dealbench .
tr	Nom	We ' re formatting one this week , and we ' ll send it when it ' s done .
tr	Nom	Do you also have a SSD we can use ?
tr	Nom	I agree also , but I don ' t know all the parties or complications involved .
tr	Nom	Can you please help with this one ?
tr	Nom	I agree with what the concern is below .
tr	Nom	We have GIS ids , and Eid ( external id - just like GIS id ).
tr	Nom	I think we should try to migrate to one of these .
tr	Nom	I ' d like to work with you on a response to this customer .
tr	Nom	To Whom It May Concern :
tr	Nom	Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information .
tr	Nom	I am very concerned about this issue .
tr	Nom	I have the following suggestion for our company .
tr	Nom	For example , I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number .
tr	Nom	I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron , especially when some databases are from third - parties ( out - sourcing ).
tr	Nom	We could use our badge number there instead of our SS .
tr	Nom	Upon receipt , I shall forward to each of you a copy of the reviews for your respective associate .
tr	Nom	In addition they will be contacting you to discuss their participation in projects outside their rotation .
tr	Nom	Shanna , I spoke with Per tonight about this .
tr	Nom	I have a copy of the document I can give to you tomorrow .
tr	Nom	I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher .
tr	Nom	Could you please ask Shanna to take this situation to Sharon tomorrow ?
tr	Nom	John , Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions .
tr	Nom	I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur .
tr	Nom	I wanted to let you know about this before I respond to her request .
tr	Nom	Kathy McMahon suggested that I contact you in an effort to gather information on : Enron ' s Affirmative Action Policy and plans ; as well as demographic analysis of workforce ( gender , age , ethnic origin , nationality )
tr	Nom	HBS will shadow Enron and a number of other companies over the next five years to assess how we react to market changes and to see how we morph during this time period .
tr	Nom	We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth , Florida project as well .
tr	Nom	In that respect , we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team .
tr	Nom	I think the first step is a call between yourself , me , Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero .
tr	Nom	I have been advised by our Construction Manager , Mr . Joe Osler that while he was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired about permit requirements to picket our site .
tr	Nom	I have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today .
tr	Nom	We will need local legal counsel to assist us in this regard .
tr	Nom	Mike Indivero , I understand that Mr . Mike Croall ' s release date from NEPCO is Oct 31 , 2001 .
tr	Nom	Thank you for the invitaion to the conference call .
tr	Nom	I would like both Lynn and I to participate .
tr	Nom	I assume we should come over EB .
tr	Nom	Can you tell us where .
tr	Nom	, Do you want us to come over to the Enron b in your call .
tr	Nom	Have you decided who will be assisting tax - wise for these two countries ?
tr	Nom	I have a conference call this afternoon at 3 pm ( Houston time ) with Antonio Felix de Araujo Cintra from the Tozzini firm regarding further research on derivative products for trading in Brazil .
tr	Nom	If you would like to participate in person or by conference , please let me know .
tr	Nom	I will be in Sao Paulo from Sept 20 - 22 and Buenos Aires from Sept 23 - 24 .
tr	Nom	In Brazil , I will be meeting again with Tozzini lawyers .
tr	Nom	In BA , I ' ll be meeting with Marval lawyers .
tr	Nom	If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system ; you should not copy this message or disclose its contents to anyone .
tr	Nom	I am waiting to hear about a possible call Friday morning .
tr	Nom	If something happens that I ' m not able to participate I ' ll let you know .
tr	Nom	The draft you received has been approved by Dan .
tr	Nom	If you would like this executed , please let me know .
tr	Nom	If you think any other pertinent information could be included , please feel free to add it .
tr	Nom	I e - mailed your assistant earlier this morning and have had no response .
tr	Nom	Can we reschedule the phone call for 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) on Friday , Sept . 17 ?
tr	Nom	I will initiate the call .
tr	Nom	I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading .
tr	Nom	It ' s a good starting point .
tr	Nom	I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina which will address both physical and financial trading .
tr	Nom	I am checking on London .
tr	Nom	I ' m not exactly certain as to what you are looking for .
tr	Nom	Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US ( although LA . is about as close as you can get to a third world country ).
tr	Nom	Here it is -- we printed this 2 - sided and laminated it .
tr	Nom	It looks like the 2 - day L / C issue is an issue .
tr	Nom	I ' ll call you shortly .
tr	Nom	He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight .
tr	Nom	Hope you ' ll have time to review it today .
tr	Nom	They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes .
tr	Nom	Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5 ) and the new l / c wording ( drops the 2 day period to replace an l / c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay ).
tr	Nom	I know we talked about these issues earlier , but Tiger ' s lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing , even if we are the one ' s issuing the gtee and l / c .
tr	Nom	Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help .
tr	Nom	There is an outside chance we could have everything set to go this week .
tr	Nom	To what do I owe this small pleasure ?
tr	Nom	I ' m fine in Texas , still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe , working hard , etc .
tr	Nom	Where are you living these days ?
tr	Nom	I ' ve simply lost track !
tr	Nom	Are you selling burgers up and down the east coast ?
tr	Nom	Have you gone international ?
tr	Nom	This weekend I ' m off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires on business .
tr	Nom	Do you miss me ?
tr	Nom	I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions ( first Argentina ) and thought your expertise would be very helpful .
tr	Nom	Could you send me a set ?
tr	Nom	I ' m leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow .
tr	Nom	Sara , here are the trader guidelines I developed for UK gas , UK power and Nordic power .
tr	Nom	I assume you need both gas and power .
tr	Nom	As these guidelines need to be approved by Houston , I am copying this to Mark , Alan and Jeff .
tr	Nom	I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions ( first Argentina ) and thought your expertise would be very helpful .
tr	Nom	Could you send me a set ?
tr	Nom	I ' m leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow .
tr	Nom	Please review the attached memo to verify that I have identified all of the products that you are interested in trading in Brazil .
tr	Nom	I will be in Sao Paulo on Monday , September 20 , 1999 .
tr	Nom	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Nom	We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback .
tr	Nom	We would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of Word , upon request by individual Parties .
tr	Nom	We look forward to seeing you on January 10 - 11 .
tr	Nom	In the meantime , we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season .
tr	Nom	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Nom	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Nom	I ' ll make the change .
tr	Nom	"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
tr	Nom	In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
tr	Nom	Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .
tr	Nom	We ' re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
tr	Nom	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
tr	Nom	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Nom	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Nom	IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
tr	Nom	You ' re right , Sue .
tr	Nom	Currently , I need three interviewers for Thursday , March 1st and one interviewer for Friday , March 2nd .
tr	Nom	In the event that you have scheduling conflicts and cannot participate , any referrals at the Director or VP level would be greatly appreciated .
tr	Nom	I ' ll not say anything .
tr	Nom	have you gotten a price ?
tr	Nom	Just like what happened in Enron ' s initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects .
tr	Nom	They are currently working on a bid ( due 1 / 31 ) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy ( operator ), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
tr	Nom	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40 , 000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
tr	Nom	Tom ' s group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis .
tr	Nom	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Nom	Please address , and I ' ll check with Legal as well .
tr	Nom	We typically only book deals when everything is signed off .
tr	Nom	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Nom	we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .
tr	Nom	therefore they will not attempt to make this claim .
tr	Nom	even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .
tr	Nom	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Nom	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .
tr	Nom	I highlight the relevant skills in the summary .
tr	Nom	It was posted on Dec . 11 , but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet , it is open .
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure how I would have handled it .
tr	Nom	Here ' s a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7 : 35am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I ' d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
tr	Nom	I couldn ' t say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs . old ) and I waited for the bus .
tr	Nom	It was now , 8 : 15 and there was no sign of her bus .
tr	Nom	On top of things , I had quiz at 8am .
tr	Nom	Which I then realized I missed .
tr	Nom	I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own .
tr	Nom	I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts .
tr	Nom	I called her grandmother and explained things to her .
tr	Nom	A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her , but I couldn ' t do it .
tr	Nom	Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8 : 30am ).
tr	Nom	I stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
tr	Nom	After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived .
tr	Nom	I told the bus driver where to drop her off .
tr	Nom	I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure .
tr	Nom	And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe .
tr	Nom	I spoke to her prior to my note .
tr	Nom	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
tr	Nom	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Nom	We are planning this event for Thursday , February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed .
tr	Nom	I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers ( Managers or above ).
tr	Nom	We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon .
tr	Nom	We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9am - 12pm ) or afternoon ( 2pm - 5pm ) complete session .
tr	Nom	In addition , we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer .
tr	Nom	Can you provide me with more details ?
tr	Nom	4 . In Section 6 . 2 . 1 I ' ll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue .
tr	Nom	7 . Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6 . 2 . 1 .
tr	Nom	I will also add granting / perfection language .
tr	Nom	11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I ' m not sure exists .
tr	Nom	12 . Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6 . 1 .
tr	Nom	I would add setoff language .
tr	Nom	I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .
tr	Nom	Please note the following as you review :
tr	Nom	"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers ."
tr	Nom	If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
tr	Nom	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Nom	"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs )."
tr	Nom	"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ..."
tr	Nom	If you are comfortable , we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms .
tr	Nom	I will start up again in mid - July ...
tr	Nom	I have faxed to you the form of Bond , our proposed Bond provisions and the EEI Master .
tr	Nom	I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e - mail .
tr	Nom	Are you okay with that ?
tr	Nom	If so , are we ready to execute ?
tr	Nom	I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions .
tr	Nom	How are you making out on the revised version of the LOC ?
tr	Nom	Are we playing tomorrow at 9 : 30 ?
tr	Nom	As I mentioned in my e - mail , John Lepore at Select Energy ( Settlements Group ) is trying to reconcile our list with his list .
tr	Nom	He needs more info about these trades ( i . e ., price info ) and would like to talk with you about it .
tr	Nom	Once we agree on the list , we can sign the EEI Master .
tr	Nom	We need to include all outstanding transactions .
tr	Nom	Do you want 6 / 1 / 01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since they have not been settled ?
tr	Nom	Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the version that you sent to me the current version ?
tr	Nom	I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
tr	Nom	I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we ' re all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
tr	Nom	As far as the EEI goes , the only remaining issue that I ' m aware of ( aside from finalizing the LOC ) is whether we ' ve finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions .
tr	Nom	Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week .

tr	Nom	We can accept the language with your chnages .
tr	Nom	Are we ready to execute ?
tr	Nom	I am out of the office today but will be back tomorrow .

tr	Nom	Is there some specific concern that we can address ?
tr	Nom	With respect to the Guaranty , I will delete the Schedule .
tr	Nom	I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft .
tr	Nom	It is a fairly standard , fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar .
tr	Nom	"You will notice that Questar has requested a "" Payment Plan "" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events ."
tr	Nom	Also , you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up , but to protect ourselves , we have added language in Para 3 . 2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax .
tr	Nom	We hope to execute this Agreement this week .
tr	Nom	If you have any comments , please let me know .
tr	Nom	After execution , we will forward a final copy to you for your files .
tr	Nom	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Nom	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
tr	Nom	If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts / materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events , please let me know .

tr	Nom	We ' ve booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday , May 24 to Newark / Rome and returning on Sunday , June 9 from Rome to Newark / Houston .
tr	Nom	Can you and Tom join us ?
tr	Nom	John , sorry for the late response , but I think you can implement immediately .
tr	Nom	I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed ( I don ' t remember if you were there or not ) but I ' m thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great , thanks !
tr	Nom	The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use , I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps . to use for updates .
tr	Nom	How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number ?
tr	Nom	We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page , we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers .
tr	Nom	Do you think we need to do more ?
tr	Nom	I was aware .
tr	Nom	I just couldn ' t remember if it was you or Terry .
tr	Nom	I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation , TK was also made aware .

tr	Nom	Here it is .
tr	Nom	These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago .
tr	Nom	Are you comfortable with the difference ?
tr	Nom	No hurry , I was just wondering .
tr	Nom	Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday .
tr	Nom	As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships .
tr	Nom	It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey .
tr	Nom	If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and / or send me their resume .
tr	Nom	Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ).
tr	Nom	We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone .
tr	Nom	Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered .
tr	Nom	We will try to complete the I / C with the earliest in - service date possible , but with conditions as they are , a realistic date would be June 15 , 2002 .
tr	Nom	If you have questions or issues , please let me know .

tr	Nom	"Listening to the Edison call w / investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("" big bang "" approach ) sometime in Q1 ' 02 ."
tr	Nom	Figured they ' d contacted them , but wanted to make sure .
tr	Nom	You know when the meeting with schedulers will be ?
tr	Nom	I apologize , I ' m on the road and haven ' t heard when that will be .
tr	Nom	I ' m thinking that I may want to attend .
tr	Nom	If you haven ' t heard , SoCal ' s announced their abandoning windows for OFOs .
tr	Nom	"They ' re holding "" workshops "" on how it will all work soon ."
tr	Nom	I ' ll get you the announcement .
tr	Nom	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California ' s energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices .
tr	Nom	"The investigative committee , headed by state Sen . Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : "" the palace coup ."""
tr	Nom	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Nom	""" I don ' t know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort ,"" said Dunn ."
tr	Nom	""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis ,"" Maviglio said ."
tr	Nom	""" It was an emergency ,"" Fishman said ."
tr	Nom	""" We had to take action .''"
tr	Nom	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Nom	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Nom	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Nom	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Nom	He didn ' t mention anything about it .
tr	Nom	""" In retrospect , we should have told them ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Nom	""" It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant ."
tr	Nom	Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .
tr	Nom	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .
tr	Nom	""" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Nom	"We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund ."""
tr	Nom	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Nom	""" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing ."""
tr	Nom	""" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark ,'' Hoecker said ."
tr	Nom	""" They ( ISO management ) did what any independent system operator would do ."""
tr	Nom	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Nom	""" We don ' t know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out ,"" Dunn said ."
tr	Nom	""" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact .''"
tr	Nom	We should resurrect Mike Smith ' s note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one .
tr	Nom	I can dig it up if you ' d like .
tr	Nom	I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA ( for customers already on DA ).
tr	Nom	Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter .
tr	Nom	"I suggest a "" blind draw "" on the teams , best ball not scramble on the golf , and as for the wager , no emails from the losing team for one week !"
tr	Nom	I ' ll leave to Steve to structure the deal .
tr	Nom	As I recall , Montavano , Shapiro and I usually make up one team , but I ' m willing to switch around a bit .
tr	Nom	Are you playing golf ?
tr	Nom	It ' s a two way street , of course .
tr	Nom	Have they expressed any interest in negotiating ?
tr	Nom	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Nom	What say ye ?
tr	Nom	By Friday December 1st , could you please tell me the percentages / amount of time you spent on East Coast Power during the months of October and November .
tr	Nom	In addition , could you look over the list below to see if there are any additional employees in your group that spent time on ECP , so we can ensure we bill all of our used resources to ECP .
tr	Nom	*** Mary Perkins - Could you forward the number of transactions and accounts .
tr	Nom	*** Jason Chumley - Could you forward the number of contractor hours and help / remote support hours .
tr	Nom	If I can get a few minutes with Mark H . today , I ' m going to propose that I speak to Stan Klimberg about getting this signed before Thursday ' s meeting with LIPA .
tr	Nom	In the three years I have been here , I am unaware of an ENA / ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company .
tr	Nom	Justin , I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here .
tr	Nom	I ' ve read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations appropriately .
tr	Nom	Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed ??
tr	Nom	We sued Houston Casualty last year but I don ' t recall making any bad faith claims .
tr	Nom	It settled anyway , a long time ago .
tr	Nom	Did you get my fax on Friday ?
tr	Nom	I guess the questions on which I should like your steer are : ( a ) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference to bad faith proceedings made by United India ?
tr	Nom	( b ) Is it right that Enron has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas ?
tr	Nom	( c ) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you ?
tr	Nom	Not when I was there , but I wasn ' t there the whole time .
tr	Nom	"were you able to discuss the "" bad faith "" proceedings issue yesterday ?"
tr	Nom	If you got the chance today , I should be really grateful if one of you could give me a call to discuss this issue ; I think we should set out DPC ' s position clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay .
tr	Nom	It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal rules .
tr	Nom	If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system ; you should not copy the message or disclose its contents to anyone .
tr	Nom	As I mentioned , please let me know when it is ready , and I will send someone to pick it up .
tr	Nom	Have you heard if the Kinga has had little Brian II yet ?
tr	Nom	As you can tell from the time of my e - mail , I am getting crushed .
tr	Nom	I am sending you a letter from their atty .
tr	Nom	As of today , we have not received payment in full as requested in Richard Sanders ' letter dated November 16 , 2000 .
tr	Nom	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Nom	I am sending you a letter from their atty .
tr	Nom	As of today , we have not received payment in full as requested in Richard Sanders ' letter dated November 16 , 2000 .
tr	Nom	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Nom	As you may recall , they say they want a deposition on the parties ' intention .
tr	Nom	We should be expecting a deposition notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat .
tr	Nom	I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A & K has filed setting forth the Trustee ' s position in connection with the enforcement / nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the Trustee is seeking .
tr	Nom	As you see below , she is pulling those together .
tr	Nom	I have my paralegal gathering the pleadings Enron requested .
tr	Nom	If you have received this communication in error , please immediately notify us by telephone ( 713 - 546 - 5000 ), and destroy the original message .
tr	Nom	While I left a you a phone message with some information about our project , I thought I could give you some additional details by e - mail as well ...
tr	Nom	We are still very interested in having Enron support our eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol .?
tr	Nom	We have had enthusiastic responses from companies such as AT & T , Duke Energy , Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler , and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal point for our educational efforts .?
tr	Nom	I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association ' s dispute management systems and services for eCommerce B2B transactions .?
tr	Nom	At this time we are putting together small working groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service offerings .
tr	Nom	Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from finance , legal , and operations so that we get good cross - functional feedback about our services .?
tr	Nom	Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting .
tr	Nom	The real focus of the meeting will be on how we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B marketplaces .?
tr	Nom	We are very concerned with providing services that are relevant to that environment .
tr	Nom	We would like to meet between November 14 and ? December 1 ? since construction of our services is already underway .?
tr	Nom	Do you have a tel # for Mike ?
tr	Nom	I ' ll send a copy of the suit filed against the generators as soon as I get it .
tr	Nom	OK , perhaps it was inevitable .
tr	Nom	But it is now official .
tr	Nom	We are hopeful that we can post the complaint to the UCAN web site later today .
tr	Nom	""" Time is the best teacher , except for the fact that it kills off its best students """
tr	Nom	the industry of Marriage and Kids , you heard me .
tr	Nom	How can I say such an abomination , ask you ?
tr	Nom	These are the kids who will destroy society , because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture , you heard again .
tr	Nom	And you might think by reading this I blame the kids .....
tr	Nom	Not so , Kids are what kids are and will do what they do .
tr	Nom	It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them .
tr	Nom	It ' s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
tr	Nom	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .
tr	Nom	Probably it is .
tr	Nom	You made a choice to be a mommy , you dont get a break until they move out , thats the choice that you madea and that ' s life .
tr	Nom	Just because you ' re stuck , doesnt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you .
tr	Nom	"Another time I ' ll segueway into all the fun work related instances where "" Mommies "" get out of doing work and hiding behind childcare as the reason ."
tr	Nom	"This is the insidious conspiracy I call "" Mommism ""."
tr	Nom	It must be stamped out .
tr	Nom	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Nom	I hope so .
tr	Nom	"Seeing another "" Columbia "" incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas )."
tr	Nom	We don ' t need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species .
tr	Nom	Maybe one day they will allow space tourism , ( hopefully that will be in the near future ) although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones .
tr	Nom	"You do have to give NASA credit on some things as they have eliminated the "" fear of reporting failure "" culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the Columbia shuttle ."
tr	Nom	Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems ( as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses ).
tr	Nom	I see the merit in flowing with duality .
tr	Nom	I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body , mind and soul .
tr	Nom	Think of all life , if you will , as one great choir or one grand congregation .
tr	Nom	Any major dischord and we all suffer .
tr	Nom	Living out of synch with nature is the great disease , from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness .
tr	Nom	We are only as strong as our weakest , we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager .
tr	Nom	When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down .
tr	Nom	There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
tr	Nom	What you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you .
tr	Nom	We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment , our rejection of the natural for the industrial , and our embrace of violence over peace .
tr	Nom	Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him .
tr	Nom	What are you doing to the least of the people ?
tr	Nom	If we are all in this thing together , let ' s play nice .
tr	Nom	Remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else , remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny .
tr	Nom	No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier , we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality .
tr	Nom	Will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard ?
tr	Nom	Will we choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger ?
tr	Nom	What are you searching for ?
tr	Nom	Whether you are looking for a part - time income to help pay off your debts or you are looking for the freedom offered by working from home on a full time basis , Agel is the vehicle that can make that happen .
tr	Nom	It is our belief that this compensation plan will produce some of the largest checks in network marketing history .
tr	Nom	It is a revolutionary hybrid .
tr	Nom	It is not just company longevity .

tr	Nom	""" All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [ River ] valley where we were canoeing ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Nom	Dr . Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
tr	Nom	""" I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out ."""
tr	Nom	""" The bear gave chase and I gave chase ,"" he said ."
tr	Nom	"I was beside the bear ' s head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times ."""
tr	Nom	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Nom	Mr . Crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .
tr	Nom	It was the favorite fruit of founder Steve Jobs .
tr	Nom	He was three months late in filing a name for the business , and he threatened to call his company Apple Computers if the other colleagues didn ' t suggest a better name by 5 O ' clock .
tr	Nom	It is not an acronym as popularly believed .
tr	Nom	It is short for San Francisco .
tr	Nom	It stands for COwpland REsearch Laboratory .
tr	Nom	It was originally named ' Googol ', a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 zeros .
tr	Nom	"When Sabeer Bhatia came up with the business plan for the mail service , he tried all kinds of names ending in ' mail ' and finally settled for hotmail as it included the letters "" html "" - the programming language used to write web pages ."

tr	Nom	Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tossed a coin to decidewhether the company they founded would be called Hewlett - Packard or Packard - Hewlett .
tr	Nom	The project eventually was terminated but Larry and Bob decided to finish what they started and bring it to the world .
tr	Nom	They kept the name Oracle and created the RDBMS engine .
tr	Nom	Later they kept the same name for the company .
tr	Nom	It originated from the Latin word ' sonus ' meaning sound , and ' sonny ' a slang used by Americans to refer to a bright youngster .
tr	Nom	It represents a person who is repulsive in appearance and action and is barely human .
tr	Nom	Yahoo ! Founders Jerry Yang and DavidFilo selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos ...
tr	Nom	I am on Yahoo !
tr	Nom	I say why not ?
tr	Nom	The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it ' s not going to go away .
tr	Nom	I have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason .
tr	Nom	That said , the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :).
tr	Nom	I ' m nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions .
tr	Nom	Im really looking forward to Guild Wars .
tr	Nom	Anyway , I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I missed out on 2 / 3 weekend events .
tr	Nom	Oh well , I ' ll get it when it comes out in Febuary .
tr	Nom	BUT they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long .
tr	Nom	as far as pre order go to and they have a list of major retailers that carry it there are also a few websites that you could order it off of .
tr	Nom	I was kind of curious , what exactly is Guild Wars ?
tr	Nom	I havn ' t heard of it .
tr	Nom	It ' s a massive multiplayer role playing game .
tr	Nom	The graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics I have ever seen for any game and I have been gaming since the MUD days .
tr	Nom	It ' s worth a look .
tr	Nom	I have a preorder and am even considering getting a second preorder to have multiple accounts .
tr	Nom	I have participated in all the weekend beta events and the world preview .
tr	Nom	I can ' t imagine them not being able to meet the Feb 05 deadline .

tr	Nom	I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence .
tr	Nom	I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
tr	Nom	I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty - five percent ( 10 - 25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture .
tr	Nom	I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
tr	Nom	I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried .
tr	Nom	But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day .
tr	Nom	A bold step taken shall not be regretted , I assure you .
tr	Nom	If you do not wish to co - operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter .

tr	Nom	You can get details about NASA spending here , from their own webpage .
tr	Nom	I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
tr	Nom	i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers ' money , but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies , that i find it best not to think about it .
tr	Nom	i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste , but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA .
tr	Nom	in response to Steve ' s comment : do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone ?

tr	Nom	China ' s insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
tr	Nom	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .

tr	Nom	If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .
tr	Nom	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Nom	Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .
tr	Nom	As you sit above the world , the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer .
tr	Nom	It surrounds you .
tr	Nom	Now you are far above the earth - into space .
tr	Nom	You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you .
tr	Nom	The sun ' s rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .
tr	Nom	You are in a state of peace and relaxation .
tr	Nom	You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
tr	Nom	Another thing you can try .
tr	Nom	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Nom	Feel that you ' re sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
tr	Nom	Feel you ' re completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
tr	Nom	Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you ' re repeating it .
tr	Nom	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Nom	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
tr	Nom	Feel you ' re surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
tr	Nom	You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity .
tr	Nom	Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .
tr	Nom	Don ' t worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that ' s normal .

tr	Nom	From what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage .
tr	Nom	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Nom	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .

tr	Nom	We become most fully human when we love another person .
tr	Nom	We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
tr	Nom	Throughout history , tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families , they can kill the spirit of those peoples .
tr	Nom	We feel called to protest and oppose this injustice .
tr	Nom	As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life .
tr	Nom	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
tr	Nom	As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
tr	Nom	We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
tr	Nom	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
tr	Nom	However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
tr	Nom	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .
tr	Nom	We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter .
tr	Nom	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Nom	As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
tr	Nom	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
tr	Nom	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Nom	He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
tr	Nom	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Nom	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
tr	Nom	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Nom	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Nom	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Nom	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Nom	Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
tr	Nom	""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President ."""
tr	Nom	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
tr	Nom	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .

tr	Nom	China ' s overtures to join the U .

tr	Nom	""" We applaud China ' s space achievements ,"" NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday ."
tr	Nom	""" We wish them a successful return of their astronauts ."""
tr	Nom	He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week ' s Chinese mission through formal channels .
tr	Nom	The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi - compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
tr	Nom	""" There is always the possibility they could jam us up , make us look like we are not numero uno ,"" Pike said ."

tr	Nom	"And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch ."""

tr	Nom	I ' m a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
tr	Nom	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Nom	"The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their "" product "" as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love ."
tr	Nom	Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
tr	Nom	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Nom	Right now , while we ' re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
tr	Nom	The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust .
tr	Nom	I am serious about doing something .
tr	Nom	If I love cats so much , why aren ' t I DOING something ???
tr	Nom	I don ' t want to appear before God on judgment day and have to explain why I didn ' t do anything like this in my life .
tr	Nom	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Nom	"Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats "" Meowing ,"" I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture ."
tr	Nom	I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
tr	Nom	I will .
tr	Nom	I ' ve pasted the email for those who haven ' t seen or would like to re - read it .
tr	Nom	It ' s also got the website where the song has been uploaded .
tr	Nom	I was thinking , that while I ' m sitting here , relaxing and enjoying myself , those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust - esque death chambers .
tr	Nom	And what am I DOING about it ?
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure if any of you know much about civet cats , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles .
tr	Nom	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Nom	But this is what he says about civet cats :
tr	Nom	They are confined in this way until they finally die .
tr	Nom	"To promote one of the most trivial interests we have , thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives ."""
tr	Nom	But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download , especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine ( 28k ).
tr	Nom	Although there are no human vocals / lyrics , I think it ' s subject matter is audible .
tr	Nom	It ' s also on the net .

tr	Nom	By the end of the second week I had made a total of more than $ 1000 . 00 !!
tr	Nom	In the third week I had more than $ 10 , 000 . 00 and it ' s still growing !!

tr	Nom	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Nom	Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
tr	Nom	"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf ' s relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
tr	Nom	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
tr	Nom	Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
tr	Nom	""" All you have to do is look at the photographs ,"" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI ' s Blue Planet ,"
tr	Nom	""" You say , ' wow !'"

tr	Nom	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf ' s status .
tr	Nom	They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
tr	Nom	It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
tr	Nom	They seem to be just that : rumors .
tr	Nom	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Nom	Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .
tr	Nom	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .
tr	Nom	Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends , but meanwhile Earth ' s plants , insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome .
tr	Nom	They already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening .
tr	Nom	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non - human natural world to changing conditions , and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming .
tr	Nom	The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to .
tr	Nom	""" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding ,"" she said ."
tr	Nom	""" Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver ,"" she said ."
tr	Nom	"Throughout the United States , she said , "" spring is about two weeks earlier ."
tr	Nom	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""
tr	Nom	""" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction ,"" the report concluded ."
tr	Nom	The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non - commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .
tr	Nom	They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non - commercial species , and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy .

tr	Nom	Has it altered your life ?

tr	Nom	Distances are not what they are in the old world .
tr	Nom	Here , cars are absolutely necessary , and he ' d have to have one , too .
tr	Nom	It is always interesting what spin the press will take .
tr	Nom	I don ' t believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news .
tr	Nom	I have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery .
tr	Nom	Yes , she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country .
tr	Nom	You know , I ' ve lived in the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life .

tr	Nom	There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and I ' ve vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi , and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white ( less than 20 %) in northeastern Arkansas .
tr	Nom	The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t expect to react that way , but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else looked pretty much like me , it was really very eerie .
tr	Nom	Additionally , reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes , you ' ll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states .
tr	Nom	Yes , it ' s a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .
tr	Nom	However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know if this will change other nation ' s perceptions of America .
tr	Nom	I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
tr	Nom	I do know that this will change the face of America .
tr	Nom	I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
tr	Nom	Sure , some will return , but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing , they may be shy about returning .
tr	Nom	I ' m interested in what America will look like in 5 years .
tr	Nom	These are some of the things I ' ve been wondering ...
tr	Nom	Okay , I ' m new to this forum and really don ' t like Bush , so my view point is slanted and I admit that .
tr	Nom	I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what ' s the point ?
tr	Nom	What I know is that I have a close friend who ' s aunt disappeared in New Orleans .
tr	Nom	The family here ( California ) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA , so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there .
tr	Nom	It is Oct . 6 , and not one family member has been located .
tr	Nom	What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation .
tr	Nom	What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he didn ' t order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
tr	Nom	When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become ?
tr	Nom	Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk .
tr	Nom	Even he can ' t believe that he is trotting out this old saw again .
tr	Nom	I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once , you can ' t help but trot it out every time your act is going sour .
tr	Nom	"We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "" FREEDOM "" why not spend those billions making all of us free ?"

tr	Nom	This is the year you ' ll want to take stock of your career and ask yourself if you ' re doing the work you want to do for the rest of your life .
tr	Nom	By the end of the year , you will have a whole new network of friends and group activity , stimulating new ideas and taking up your social life a notch or two .
tr	Nom	You now have it in you to create the kind of life for yourself that you want .
tr	Nom	By the end of 2005 you ' ll have a whole new start with regard to your career and your earning potential - and a possible new partnership to top it off !
tr	Nom	Enjoy the restful periods when you can .
tr	Nom	You ' ll be making radical changes in your work habits , but you ' ll be a lot happier for it , and in the end you ' ll know it was worth it .

tr	Nom	Pursuing a successful career , along with the usual social and financial advantages , will be easier this year than it has in a long time for you , Leo !
tr	Nom	You ' ll be able to create opportunities for advancement almost out of thin air .
tr	Nom	Yet , this is no comparison to the advancements you ' ll make overall , and by the end of 2005 , you ' ll look back in sheer wonder and happiness .
tr	Nom	For much of 2005 , you ' ll be putting your nose to the grindstone .
tr	Nom	And , you ' re going to develop a hopeless romantic streak .
tr	Nom	If you ' re not presently married , and want to be , you just might wed by the end of the year .
tr	Nom	This is the year you ' re going to be doing a lot of travel and learning about your world , as expansion is the theme .
tr	Nom	The one department of life that may not quite be as hopeful as you ' d like could be your career , where advancement may be slow and satisfaction rare .
tr	Nom	By year ' s end , you may find yourself seriously considering a major change - all for the best .
tr	Nom	Scorpio , you can still expect changes - perhaps major ones - in your life this year , almost to the point of total transformation .
tr	Nom	You may also change your residence during the year .
tr	Nom	Whether you start the year as a single person looking for a partner , or you ' ve been married for many years , happiness in love does lie ahead .
tr	Nom	They may not be familiar , but they will be fascinating .
tr	Nom	Are you prepared to handle absolute power ?
tr	Nom	If not , you will be soon !
tr	Nom	There ' s so much punch packed into this combination that it ' s almost scary .
tr	Nom	You ' ll find the ultimate power is the ability to choose your own destiny .
tr	Nom	You ' ll find practical ways of increasing your effectiveness in the world by gaining new skills that allow you to live more abundantly .

tr	Nom	2005 sees you expanding your intuitive and psychic skills even more , Aquarius .
tr	Nom	It ' s a big year for you , friend Pisces .
tr	Nom	No doubt , in 2005 you ' ll find yourself pushed more and more out into the world .
tr	Nom	You ' ll experience a new sense of purpose and make plenty of new friends .
tr	Nom	At some point during the year , you could pick up a financial windfall , hear of a great career opportunity , or unexpectedly meet the love of your life .
tr	Nom	It ' s important that you take retreats and plenty of time for yourself to regenerate , as the rate of change in your personal and professional life will be fast and unpredictable .
tr	Nom	Upon the same day he conquered Darius , won a great victory at sea , & died the same day .
tr	Nom	"<< In "" Love ' s Labour ' s Lost "" we find a character Don Adriana de Armatho , full of affection and bombast ."
tr	Nom	A Spanish refugee , ANTONIO PEREZ , visited England in 1593 and became acquainted with Francis & ANTHONY Bacon , with whom for a time he seems to have been on terms of intimacy , which did not last very long , for the Spaniard developed so much affectation & bombast that he became unpopular in Court circles .
tr	Nom	True , but two in England that we know of were a part of the Essex entourage : Dr . Lopez , who had been physician to Essex ' step - father , the Earl of Leicester , had apparently treated the young Essex for some socially unacceptable ailment , and Antonio Perez , who was a guest at Essex House in the early 1590 ' s .
tr	Nom	To be sure , both Lopez & Perez were conversos -- but they were thought of in England as being , as they undoubtedly were , at least ethnically , Jews .>>
tr	Nom	"Long before ( September 1560 ) Dr . Lopez had been the personal house doctor of Robert Dudley and the good doctor was obligated to write the death certificate for Amy Robsart ( stating that she had "" accidentally "" fallen down the stairs )."
tr	Nom	"<<"" I have told you , friend ,"" said the curate , "" that this is done to divert our idle thoughts ; and as in well - ordered states games of CHESS , fives , and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care , or are not obliged , or are unable to work , so books of this kind are allowed to be printed , on the supposition that , what indeed is the truth , there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories ;>>"
tr	Nom	"<<"" Well then ,"" said Don Quixote , "" the same thing happens in the comedy and life of this world , where some play emperors , others popes , and , in short , all the characters that can be brought into a play ; but when it is over , that is to say when life ends , death strips them all of the garments that distinguish one from the other , and all are equal in the grave ."""
tr	Nom	""" A fine comparison !"" said Sancho ; "" though not so new but that I have heard it many and many a time , as well as that other one of the game of CHESS ; how , so long as the game lasts , each piece has its own particular office , and when the game is finished they are all mixed , jumbled up and shaken together , and stowed away in the bag , which is much like ending life in the grave ."""
tr	Nom	""" Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day , Sancho ,"" said Don Quixote ."
tr	Nom	""" Ay ,"" said Sancho ; "" it must be that some of your worship ' s shrewdness sticks to me ; land that , of itself , is barren and dry , will come to yield good fruit if you dung it and till it >>"
tr	Nom	Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading from the waters over the land , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . .
tr	Nom	He turned away .
tr	Nom	He could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare , which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss .
tr	Nom	<< He could do little during the day , for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas , or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
tr	Nom	At night , however , he slept alone , and the avenger might find him .
tr	Nom	On a certain evening , which had been prearranged , I sent my friend final instructions , for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room .
tr	Nom	I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed .
tr	Nom	In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez , the secretary .
tr	Nom	He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note .
tr	Nom	He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress .
tr	Nom	Then and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed .
tr	Nom	Finally , after much debate , they concluded that my murder was too dangerous .
tr	Nom	But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia .
tr	Nom	They had gagged me , and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address .
tr	Nom	I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia .
tr	Nom	Lopez addressed the note which I had written , sealed it with his sleeve - link , and sent it by the hand of the servant , Jose .
tr	Nom	How they murdered him I do not know , save that it was Murillo ' s hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .
tr	Nom	I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed .
tr	Nom	At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar ; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks .
tr	Nom	"It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith ( also from Liverpool ): "" Not even God can sink my ship "" ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool )."
tr	Nom	It came from the nation whose king Enrique VIII adulterated the Bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom God provided a wife with six fingers as abomination ( Anne Boleyn )... once again 6 , number of the Beast ....
tr	Nom	"It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "" the Devil ' s Island ""."
tr	Nom	It will vanish and shrink .
tr	Nom	"We are more popular than Jesus and Pope ""...."
tr	Nom	"Came the disintegration of the Beatles ' minds with LSD which has caused , among others , schizophrenic lyrics such as "" I am the Walrus "" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "" Revolution number 9 ""."
tr	Nom	"Antichrist John Lennon followed the Devil ' s strategy writing lyrics such as "" God is a concept by which we measure our pain ... I don ' t believe in Jesus , etc ., etc .,"" ( God ) and "" and no religions too ..."" ( Imagine )."
tr	Nom	"Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "" Peace "", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of "" The ballad of John and Yoko "": "" the way things are going , they ' re going to crucify me ..."", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine ( today condensed in the "" Lennon remembers "" book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming "" whatever is up there "" for it ( referring to God )."
tr	Nom	The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead .
tr	Nom	It is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times , being seven , as well as three , the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition ....
tr	Nom	"To Paul McCartney whose company ' s logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "" Sir "" ( when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir , as long as he produces money for the nation ), GOD provided cancer to the wife ."
tr	Nom	"The advertising farce of how much he loved Linda ( woman whose quality he did not deserve ), was exposed when it was known that Paul had an affair with Heather Mills , Linda ' s intimate friend , with whom McCartney went on a trip to New York and to whom he bought things and presents , while he was still mourning for his "" dear Linda ""."
tr	Nom	At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda ' s death for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity .
tr	Nom	Paul was going out with Heather , but in front of the audience he played the faithful husband ' s masquerade pretending to suffer for Linda , for the afore mentioned promotional ends .
tr	Nom	Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he didn ' t say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much .
tr	Nom	"It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : "" I ' ve got a feeling , a feeling I can ' t hide ..."" in front of Yoko in the film ."
tr	Nom	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Nom	Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg , so that he could stand out , being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again , as Jane and Linda did .
tr	Nom	He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness .
tr	Nom	That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be .
tr	Nom	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Nom	"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" they advise black Joe to "" get back to where you once belonged "", as if England was not a place for black people ."
tr	Nom	Sometimes back , Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles .
tr	Nom	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .
tr	Nom	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Nom	It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him .
tr	Nom	George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon ....
tr	Nom	"George Harrison said in a video that "" Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn ' t be playing at all "", all of it being the truth , but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians , if musicians at all , who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis ."
tr	Nom	Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic , and he does lots of charity , thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife ' s life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic .
tr	Nom	He thinks he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived .
tr	Nom	If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house , it is because you own some L . P , CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones .

tr	Nom	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Nom	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Nom	They include 120 , 000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Nom	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Nom	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Nom	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Nom	It is Iran ' s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .
tr	Nom	Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 sailors .
tr	Nom	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .
tr	Nom	China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .
tr	Nom	"They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose ."""
tr	Nom	When China ' s currency ceases to be undervalued , American shoppers in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think they are in Neiman Marcus .
tr	Nom	Should they decide to squeeze , we will all feel it .
tr	Nom	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Nom	They did it once already in Iraq .

tr	Nom	In fact Philippines is famous to accept people like these people i mentioned whose not filipinos but helping the Philippines to plunge in the pit as they are the rot of the country .

tr	Nom	Would you recommend living in Limerick as a student ?
tr	Nom	I ' ve been given the opportunity to live in Limerick , Ireland , next year as part of my course .. if you know about Limerick , what are the pros and cons ?
tr	Nom	and would you recommend it as a student ?
tr	Nom	Limerick ' s a great student city , there ' s loads on , you ' ll be spoilt for choice .
tr	Nom	In fact , you probably won ' t ever want to leave .
tr	Nom	Limerick is such a full city , shopping , night life , career choices , social choices , I came here about 12 years ago for college ..... and Orla got it spot on , I haven ' t left , nor would I .
tr	Nom	Its now my home .
tr	Nom	I really like the MIUI , but a process crashes repeatedly about every 3 seconds .
tr	Nom	And I can ' t even load the newest version of Cyanogen Mod .
tr	Nom	not by the company ... as you voided your warrenty by installing custom roms
tr	Nom	you are best to either recover to the standard ROM , or find one that doesn ' t crash .
tr	Nom	Have you tried using clockwork recovery ?
tr	Nom	Also you could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake .
tr	Nom	Or you could just use a home screen launcher replacement .
tr	Nom	I would recommend go launcher or adw launcher .
tr	Nom	They are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit .
tr	Nom	As a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom .
tr	Nom	Hope you read through this .
tr	Nom	and how big are they ?
tr	Nom	im 33 .
tr	Nom	ive never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all ... i can see the penines in the far distance from my bedroom window .
tr	Nom	when i watched werewolf in london ( great film ) that was the only time i saw the yorkshire moors .
tr	Nom	They can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands , then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
tr	Nom	They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out , and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers .
tr	Nom	I have a western pleasure appy thats really heavy on her left lead at the lope ?
tr	Nom	She seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat ...
tr	Nom	How could I work with her to get off her four hand , get balance , and lope smoothly and slowly ??
tr	Nom	Put on a pair of spurs and before she makes that trot step , it ' s in the feeling when you feel her think trot , tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving .
tr	Nom	If you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant .
tr	Nom	is it a gud option for casual / formal functions photography ?????
tr	Nom	is it comparable to sony products or not ??
tr	Nom	it has 14 mega pixel camera ... n 4xwide optical zoom ...

tr	Nom	just want to ask .. i have an nikon dslr .. im wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200 - 300percent .. i can see some dead pixel ... is there something wrong with my camera body ?
tr	Nom	or it is normal ?
tr	Nom	Are you sure it isn ' t dirt on the sensor ?
tr	Nom	Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
tr	Nom	You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
tr	Nom	If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can ' t find something in your own field .
tr	Nom	I have posted this question on the NZ visa site and can ' t get any info , does anyone know .???
tr	Nom	That would be preferable but it doesn ' t matter , could be something similar
tr	Nom	It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Nom	It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Nom	Take the red line to Clark , then you turn right .
tr	Nom	"You will get to a place called "" BIG BOWL ""."
tr	Nom	Not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go .
tr	Nom	You can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner .
tr	Nom	Check out http :// www . restaurant . com lots of restaurants you can look at the menu and check out prices .
tr	Nom	"Yo also may want to try "" small neighborhood "" restaurants and support family run places rather than the large corporate chains ."
tr	Nom	Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area .
tr	Nom	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Nom	I know that the mouse will probably die , but I was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Nom	I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
tr	Nom	Or , you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals .
tr	Nom	So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend .
tr	Nom	She loves giraffes and homemade things !
tr	Nom	I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture .
tr	Nom	I don ' t have much money so I bought Crayola Air - Dry Clay .
tr	Nom	I have sculpted the giraffe laying down .
tr	Nom	The key is ... I have a few problems :
tr	Nom	1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
tr	Nom	And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile !
tr	Nom	2 . What kind of paint do I use to paint the giraffe ?
tr	Nom	air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent , so you can leave the wire armature inside , paint with acrylic paint

tr	Nom	He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
tr	Nom	What cleaners should I use for dusting around my parakeet ?
tr	Nom	What cleaners can I use to dust around my budgie .
tr	Nom	If you must use a cleaner , pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated .
tr	Nom	I have had parakeets for a VERY long time , and I use pledge .
tr	Nom	I agree w the answer from Nothing .

tr	Nom	can i buy a laptop in u . k and then take it to rep . ireland and put a irish pay , go dongle init ?
tr	Nom	i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
tr	Nom	Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
tr	Nom	But word of advice if you ' re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
tr	Nom	yes of course you can ....
tr	Nom	I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here
tr	Nom	If in dongle you mean USB stick then yes USB sticks are the same any were you go :) hope that answered your question .
tr	Nom	How do I take care of my newborn baby fish ?
tr	Nom	I am nervous that my other fish will eat them , and I don ' t know what to feed them !
tr	Nom	I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
tr	Nom	You could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish ( also the parents ) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten .
tr	Nom	Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded .
tr	Nom	what kind of newborn fish you have ?
tr	Nom	I have a question about McDonald ' s Monopoly !
tr	Nom	If you can ?
tr	Nom	Ok , I know that Mcdonald ' s has Monopoly going on right now .
tr	Nom	& I wanna know what food has the game pieces .
tr	Nom	When most of the food or drinks I got only included two !
tr	Nom	So can somebody please list ALL of the food that includes the game pieces , and the number of game pieces you get with THAT FOOD !
tr	Nom	scroll down and this website shows each thing you can buy (:
tr	Nom	bit of a stupid question but do the spikes / spines ( whatever you call them ) on their side and face area ever go hard .
tr	Nom	or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them
tr	Nom	iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time .. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft .
tr	Nom	they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i wouldnt .
tr	Nom	they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :)
tr	Nom	Theyre not really hard .
tr	Nom	I ' m assuming it ' s to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies .
tr	Nom	they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them .
tr	Nom	They just are there as an adaptation .
tr	Nom	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Nom	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Nom	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Nom	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Nom	I know that ' s vague , but it depends on the horse .
tr	Nom	The rider needs to have independent hands as well , because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)
tr	Nom	I want to save up for a canon t3i , around 750 - 800 + :(
tr	Nom	I ' m currently 12 and I get about 20 dollars a week for lunch , sometimes a bit more , I plan to save 10 dollars every week :)
tr	Nom	Can someone cunclude how long it might take me to save up for the canan t3i or some extra tips to save / gain money ? : O
tr	Nom	Be happy you get a bit , many of us never got nothing :)
tr	Nom	It ' s around $ 100 less , which means you get the same camera but quicker !
tr	Nom	If you can ' t even do basic math , you ' ll never figure out how to use a DSLR camera properly .
tr	Nom	hey kido u made me smile
tr	Nom	does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air ?
tr	Nom	its for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
tr	Nom	"took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ("" the way you would icing "") to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "" mud """
tr	Nom	- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
tr	Nom	- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
tr	Nom	For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm # LGGOBPROJ
tr	Nom	I ' m getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it ?
tr	Nom	I ' m quite sure , you don ' t even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it ' s edges , the part that is making the noise .
tr	Nom	I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn ' t use it -
tr	Nom	he makes so much MORE noise , as he plays and digs and jumps ( seriously )
tr	Nom	How can I change my boarding station against the ticket I booked a month back from counter ?
tr	Nom	If yes , you don ' t need to change it because you board later .
tr	Nom	If no , you ' ll have to go to one of the train stations .
tr	Nom	In Calcutta there is a Foreigner ' s reservation office where they speak English very well .
tr	Nom	I don ' t remember near which station it is though .
tr	Nom	They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones ?
tr	Nom	Even if you don ' t find the foreigner ' s office you ' ll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station .
tr	Nom	This is where you can get AND change express train tickets .
tr	Nom	You might end up as a no show passenger .
tr	Nom	It makes a huge difference .
tr	Nom	Sorry , I would put that application in the round file .
tr	Nom	Canadian student visa , can I used for other schools ?
tr	Nom	I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada , I received one that is valid until October of 2015 .
tr	Nom	Problem is , for some reason , the visa process took longer than it should , thus I missed school this semester ( visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn ' t attend ), now I no longer want to go into that school ( because they only would accept me again on September of 2012 ), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012 , can I use the same visa that was issued to me ?
tr	Nom	or do I need to reapply ?
tr	Nom	How Do you Prevent A Dwarf Hamster Escaping From The Cage ?
tr	Nom	Im getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT !!!
tr	Nom	would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it cant escape i can buy it a wheel
tr	Nom	I ' ve never had a dwarf hamster but I ' ve had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it can ' t out .
tr	Nom	Yes I ' ve had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good
tr	Nom	This is the cage I have whhich is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to escape from :
tr	Nom	I love this cage , it ' s easy to clean , very spacious and fun for the hamster
tr	Nom	I am 17 years old .
tr	Nom	I do not get along with my family .
tr	Nom	I dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment .
tr	Nom	I am very unhappy here .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know the best way of doing it .
tr	Nom	Would it be best for me to finish college ?
tr	Nom	I live in London .
tr	Nom	I want to go travelling .
tr	Nom	I don ' t particularly want to stay with them atm either .
tr	Nom	But right now its the most convenient thing to do .
tr	Nom	anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience .
tr	Nom	I want to go all over :) I don ' t have a set route yet .
tr	Nom	You can always beg for spare change when you get hungry .
tr	Nom	I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
tr	Nom	The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
tr	Nom	Right , I couldn ' t find any proven source for that .
tr	Nom	"In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named "" first name "" according to that of their fathers ."
tr	Nom	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Nom	"But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain "" First name "" in order to recall about their origination ."
tr	Nom	I ' m pretty sure that Mayko is Japanese .
tr	Nom	She is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure where her first name is from ...
tr	Nom	I have a splitter / filter between my ADSL and ph line ?
tr	Nom	I have 2 phones running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter , I ' m still getting a buzzing noise even when I have disconnected the other phone without one .
tr	Nom	Why is it stil doing this even though I don ' t have the other phone connected ?
tr	Nom	Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well ?
tr	Nom	if everything is filtered , and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there , try doubling up on the filters ...
tr	Nom	You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks , except the one which the DSL modem connects .
tr	Nom	I ' ve modified my Holga 120 to take 35mm film and I know that you can ' t wind the film back , you have to open the back of the camera ( in a darkroom ) to rewind the film .
tr	Nom	What do other Holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling ?
tr	Nom	Do you just take a changing bag with you ?
tr	Nom	It ' s light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera .
tr	Nom	You can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc .
tr	Nom	It ' s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you ' re outside .
tr	Nom	I have a few how to videos for DIY 35mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel :
tr	Nom	I ' ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David .
tr	Nom	no , it ' s only a body of a young man
tr	Nom	"An art teacher in the mid - cities area of Dallas / Ft . Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw "" nudes "" in the museum ."
tr	Nom	You don ' t think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
tr	Nom	No , it was guys .
tr	Nom	I am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak .
tr	Nom	We are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so I wanted something close .
tr	Nom	I have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu ...
tr	Nom	I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments .
tr	Nom	I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome .
tr	Nom	It ' s narrowed down to Butcher and Singer , Davio ' s , and Del Friscos .
tr	Nom	Sidenote ... I am familiar with the Capital Grille , Barclay Prime , The Palm , The Prime Rib , Mortons , Ruth Chris ', etc .
tr	Nom	I have weighed those options and found the three that I have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste .
tr	Nom	Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier .
tr	Nom	I am only familiar with Morton ' s and Ruth Chris .
tr	Nom	I have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do I know of anyone who has .
tr	Nom	I hope you get your answer .
tr	Nom	If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
tr	Nom	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Nom	You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .
tr	Nom	You also don ' t want it getting too warm for him too often .
tr	Nom	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
tr	Nom	It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
tr	Nom	I would personally put him somewhere else .
tr	Nom	I ' m planning my trip to Asia and S . Korea is one of the destinations .
tr	Nom	It ' s so much fun over there , and I ' m positive that you ' ll love it ! :)
tr	Nom	If you ' re going to Seoul , then you should also visit a specific place called , ' The Namsan Tower '!
tr	Nom	It ' s a really huge place over there , and so many visitors / foreigners went to put chains and locks over there !
tr	Nom	It ' s so much fun !
tr	Nom	( It ' s indoors and outdoors !)
tr	Nom	( it ' s all outdoors and the pictures are only a fourth of the real Everland !)
tr	Nom	Hoped I helped ! ^ _ ^
tr	Nom	its really amazing there , itll blow your mind
tr	Nom	it ' s almost like paradise there
tr	Nom	I found an injured pure white bird ( dove I guess ?)
tr	Nom	what do I feed it ?
tr	Nom	I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood , its wing is injured , so I ' m currently taking care of it .
tr	Nom	It ' s pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I don ' t know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
tr	Nom	What should I feed it ?
tr	Nom	Doves are a species of pigeon , they are Seed eaters , they do not eat bread , or worms .
tr	Nom	make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
tr	Nom	as they can drink a lot .
tr	Nom	its jacks aquarium and pets I believe . ?
tr	Nom	anyways I feed them to my road sometimes .
tr	Nom	If you have a pet store near buy some wheat , pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do , but do not feed bread .
tr	Nom	how do i get to paris cdg airport to paris montparnasse ?
tr	Nom	i have two options
tr	Nom	if not what transfers should i get on ?
tr	Nom	As I recall , this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris .
tr	Nom	You ' ll still have to take another bus or the Metro down to Montparnasse .
tr	Nom	I use GIMP and Its not cutting it , looks terrible .
tr	Nom	Any programs that you use please list :) Thx
tr	Nom	You could also try this in gimp .
tr	Nom	It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
tr	Nom	But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if your on a macbook theres aperture :)
tr	Nom	"depends what you want from "" B & W ""... many programs will use a generic B & W ..."
tr	Nom	I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body .
tr	Nom	Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for . .
tr	Nom	Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor .
tr	Nom	I know I wouldn ' t .
tr	Nom	You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
tr	Nom	Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
tr	Nom	When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections , accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too !
tr	Nom	If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now !
tr	Nom	They do outstanding work .
tr	Nom	When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
tr	Nom	I must through it away .
tr	Nom	"If you knew what kind of "" meat "" they put in canned cat food you ' d understand this ."
tr	Nom	I ' ve had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food .
tr	Nom	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Nom	I ' ve had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food .
tr	Nom	They have done very well and like the dry food better .
tr	Nom	It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive .
tr	Nom	Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you ' re paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
tr	Nom	You ' ll also have less spoilage .
tr	Nom	He might be sick take him to the vet to see
tr	Nom	If he always does this , welcome to the club .
tr	Nom	Even if you mash it with a spoon he can ' t do that ,
tr	Nom	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Nom	If you took some Olympic - level horses on a trail ride , they just couldn ' t do it .
tr	Nom	They would be too scared and spooky .
tr	Nom	It doesn ' t matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
tr	Nom	What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
tr	Nom	That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
tr	Nom	YOU have to spend the time training .
tr	Nom	And I have not met one stuck - up trail rider !
tr	Nom	Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
tr	Nom	Same , when I ' m galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything .
tr	Nom	Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
tr	Nom	I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer .
tr	Nom	Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched .
tr	Nom	I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand .
tr	Nom	I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size .
tr	Nom	I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1 . 024 .
tr	Nom	I have a 10 gallon filter on it .
tr	Nom	I also have a powerhead , getting another soon .
tr	Nom	I have a few questions , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
tr	Nom	How would I need to set a sump for this 10 gallon ?
tr	Nom	Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?
tr	Nom	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Nom	On the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank .
tr	Nom	If you ' re going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank , getting a protein skimmer wouldn ' t be a bad idea .
tr	Nom	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Nom	From what I understand they ' re pretty much the same thing .
tr	Nom	Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
tr	Nom	I don ' t want an iPad or Kindle .
tr	Nom	I just want an e - reader that does a little bit more than just read .
tr	Nom	Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that ' s not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
tr	Nom	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Nom	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Nom	When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
tr	Nom	So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
tr	Nom	I ' m pretty sure it ' ll be worth it .
tr	Nom	Judging by Nook Tablet ' s processor it ' s supposed to be quite faster !
tr	Nom	Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
tr	Nom	Hey there , I ' m trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday .
tr	Nom	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Nom	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Nom	I ' m looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to ' s .
tr	Nom	We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I ' m not an expert on the area .
tr	Nom	Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
tr	Nom	It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
tr	Nom	It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
tr	Nom	If you ' re looking for a good burger , some great fries ( they are too die for !), and good drinks , go to Chickie & Pete ' s !
tr	Nom	Oh my gosh , they are great !
tr	Nom	If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you won ' t regret it :)
tr	Nom	I ' m getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
tr	Nom	I ' m still a beginner .
tr	Nom	Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help .
tr	Nom	When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that is floating on top .
tr	Nom	You add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
tr	Nom	If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home .
tr	Nom	Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
tr	Nom	Add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
tr	Nom	Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another .
tr	Nom	Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang ?
tr	Nom	I would like to learn how
tr	Nom	I see youre still recovering from the accident .
tr	Nom	You appear to be feeling better though .
tr	Nom	Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang .
tr	Nom	While they are extremely accurate , laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target .
tr	Nom	Therefore , you must learn to shoot manually .
tr	Nom	You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions .
tr	Nom	You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang .
tr	Nom	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Nom	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Nom	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Nom	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Nom	She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
tr	Nom	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Nom	I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he / she sleeps .
tr	Nom	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Nom	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Nom	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Nom	Can I text from Canada to the united states ?
tr	Nom	And do you get charged for it ?
tr	Nom	Im sorry if I couldn ' t say the question right .
tr	Nom	I hope somebody understands what I mean
tr	Nom	They will , however , cost a bunch .
tr	Nom	The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it wouldn ' t work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
tr	Nom	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Nom	Ye $ you can Text in CANADA to the U $ on a U $ number .
tr	Nom	It varie $ company to company .
tr	Nom	You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada .
tr	Nom	Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection .
tr	Nom	$ ometime $ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $ involved what $ ome of your money .
tr	Nom	"Hope you unde $ tood the me $$ age I do have an "" S "" key on my computer ."
tr	Nom	I need HELP with my Syrian Hamster !!!?
tr	Nom	Hi , i bought my Syrian Hamster ( Fernando ) just yesterday and as i was told to leave
tr	Nom	As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now .
tr	Nom	So now i wanted to bouild up relationship with him so i got a piece of carrot and i put it on my hand , i moved very slowly and he suddenly run away to his tube .
tr	Nom	Why , how can i build up realtion ship with him he is also not useing the thing that he runs on and he wakes up walks around and goes to sleep again ???
tr	Nom	Please help im worried about him !!!
tr	Nom	Secondly , that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night .
tr	Nom	He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit .
tr	Nom	Hope I helped !
tr	Nom	You only got him yesterday .
tr	Nom	He ' s probably still scared and unsure .
tr	Nom	Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
tr	Nom	Once he is more comfy with his surroundings , then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more .
tr	Nom	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Nom	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Nom	I ' d be happy if someone helps , especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)
tr	Nom	I LIVE THERE !
tr	Nom	... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
tr	Nom	I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
tr	Nom	Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains !
tr	Nom	... Fishing , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things you can do for fun .
tr	Nom	And now they are finishing a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only !
tr	Nom	So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but its quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
tr	Nom	Don ' t know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn ' t want to end up like them !
tr	Nom	Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
tr	Nom	I don ' t know should i buy PS3 or X - BOX Kinect .
tr	Nom	I ' m a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
tr	Nom	No matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
tr	Nom	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Nom	Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don ' t see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
tr	Nom	Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don ' t plan on making another one for a while .
tr	Nom	I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don ' t know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
tr	Nom	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Nom	I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
tr	Nom	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Nom	Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I ' ve ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional .
tr	Nom	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Nom	I thought that I had gained my cockatiel ' s trust , but now he ' s not coming to me when I open his cage .
tr	Nom	What do I do ?
tr	Nom	Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it ' s lost so easily !
tr	Nom	he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
tr	Nom	But then again he could be !
tr	Nom	the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage , and birds don ' t usually like cages .
tr	Nom	so , I don ' t think the bird don ' t trust you , but still don ' t like the cage .
tr	Nom	Hi im a big fan of breyer horses !
tr	Nom	I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit .
tr	Nom	And I need to know where to buy the materials .
tr	Nom	Please make this as simple as you can for my dad doesnt really not that good .
tr	Nom	NOTE : If i see a answer that i love i will make my best right there and then
tr	Nom	figure out how many stalls you want , then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse ,
tr	Nom	there are many small details , that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof ,
tr	Nom	check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts , you want carpenter wood glue , clamps , possibly small screws to hold corners together , miniature hinges , tape , paint , saws , drills , pencil ruler , paper , bryer horses
tr	Nom	wood can vary from cork wood or balsa wood , or press - board , or plywood , and pre - cut 2by4 or slats , you can check home depot or hardware shops for larger pieces ,
tr	Nom	How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
tr	Nom	I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today .
tr	Nom	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Nom	Almost every day he ' d even wake me up like 5am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
tr	Nom	And when I move it I guess he figures I ' m playing . x . x
tr	Nom	I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
tr	Nom	Do you think he ' s teething ?
tr	Nom	It ' s getting out of hand .
tr	Nom	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Nom	No worries , i didn ' t try .
tr	Nom	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Nom	He ' d just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
tr	Nom	When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
tr	Nom	he may be teething but i dont think it can be stopped .
tr	Nom	yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way , hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
tr	Nom	Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
tr	Nom	( Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover ) Which of these two cages is better :
tr	Nom	I cant decide between height or width .
tr	Nom	You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
tr	Nom	They LOVE to climb .
tr	Nom	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
tr	Nom	If you use this cage it ' s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
tr	Nom	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Nom	I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
tr	Nom	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Nom	i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
tr	Nom	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Nom	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Nom	i use UTH ' s on all of my burrowing snakes .
tr	Nom	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Nom	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
tr	Nom	i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
tr	Nom	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
tr	Nom	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
tr	Nom	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
tr	Nom	I was gonna have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having Having her bridal shower so brunch is it but the only places I know are denny ' s and ihop .
tr	Nom	Oh and btw I live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^ _ ^
tr	Nom	"I would strongly suggest "" The Breakfast Club "" in Chicago ."
tr	Nom	You can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices .
tr	Nom	They have fabulous French toast too .
tr	Nom	If you ' d rather dine at home , simply call in your order with our take - out service .
tr	Nom	We ' re at the corner of Hubbard and Noble .
tr	Nom	Unless you plan on being late for the bridal shower you might want to post this again in the L . A . section .
tr	Nom	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Nom	Sorry , I ' m just very nervous after watching the movie .
tr	Nom	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Nom	If you ever go on a cruise ship , you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill ( lifeboat drill ) within 24 hours of sailing .
tr	Nom	We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .
tr	Nom	Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
tr	Nom	I don ' t think so
tr	Nom	When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
tr	Nom	What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
tr	Nom	I ' ll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
tr	Nom	I ' m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
tr	Nom	Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
tr	Nom	It doesn ' t have to be underground it could be any type of music .
tr	Nom	The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
tr	Nom	Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
tr	Nom	Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa .
tr	Nom	Well first you can try speaking Japanese .
tr	Nom	You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
tr	Nom	Try the local sake too if you can .
tr	Nom	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Nom	I ' m not sure that there ' s much nightlife in Naha .
tr	Nom	It ' s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
tr	Nom	You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
tr	Nom	I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model , and in the game it ' s 3 - shot burst .
tr	Nom	He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
tr	Nom	Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it wasn ' t .
tr	Nom	Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
tr	Nom	The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
tr	Nom	you play too much cod ; P
tr	Nom	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Nom	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Nom	I ' m assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , don ' t worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
tr	Nom	As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the don ' t do any damage .
tr	Nom	Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
tr	Nom	I ' m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
tr	Nom	Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
tr	Nom	( ps . I ' m assuming you ' ll stop off in Wellington , and since its summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
tr	Nom	Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you ' ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
tr	Nom	Yes it ' s ok .
tr	Nom	What size horse do i need ?
tr	Nom	Im around 5 ' 2 - 5 ' 4 , 11 years old and im wondering what size horse i ' ll need that i wont grow out of quickly ?
tr	Nom	I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
tr	Nom	But I would go for the base number of 15hh .
tr	Nom	"It ' s "" tall "" being it ' s bigger than a pony , but it ' s on the small end for a horse ."
tr	Nom	"I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5 ' 11 "" but my horse is about 16 . 2 or 16 . 3hh , TB ."
tr	Nom	"So don ' t be afraid to get something a little bigger than "" perfect "" just in case you hit a growth spurt ."
tr	Nom	A taller horse doesn ' t always mean a horse you can ' t handle .
tr	Nom	Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
tr	Nom	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Nom	"i ' m5 ' 3 - 4 "" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14 . 2hh and she ' s perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i can ' t bareback , not yet"
tr	Nom	If you Don ' t want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
tr	Nom	Anything smaller you will grow out , anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage , especially when riding .
tr	Nom	Hope I helped :)
tr	Nom	I am going to try and study aboard but idk where I can go I cannot decide where do you think would be the best place to go ?
tr	Nom	where would you go ?
tr	Nom	I have never been anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help !!!!
tr	Nom	you speak the language and will have more fun .
tr	Nom	You will be able to have a good time there .
tr	Nom	As you ' re from the States you ' ll have much more fun in London .
tr	Nom	"I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal ( apparently this is "" washing down "" your food "") and not ordering wine ."
tr	Nom	You ' ll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
tr	Nom	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Nom	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Nom	However , if you ' re allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
tr	Nom	I lived there for 8 months .
tr	Nom	I also highly recommend staying with a French family .
tr	Nom	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
tr	Nom	Also known as the Personal Travel Allowance , Travellers Allowance Fee , Travellers Assistance Fund , Travellers Assurance Fund and numerous other forms of “ I have to have wodges of your cash or they won ’ t let me fly ”.
tr	Nom	"THERE IS NO SUCH THING any more , anywhere , it ’ s an online dating scam ."""
tr	Nom	Just pray that you have not ever given this criminal enough information for your identity to be stolen - your full name , birthdate , home address , etc or that you were not conned into sending money .
tr	Nom	"There is no such thing as a BTA or "" Basic Travel Allowance ""- this is 100 % a scam - as the first poster said , cut off any and all contact with this person - they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be ."

tr	Nom	How can i make my Jack Dempsey reproduce ?
tr	Nom	i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
tr	Nom	"He ' s the issue , you are trying to "" Make "" them mate ."
tr	Nom	It doesn ' t work .
tr	Nom	First you need a compatible pair .
tr	Nom	Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
tr	Nom	The difference is what they need to live , VS what ' s ideal for them .
tr	Nom	Get that right , and they will mate when THEY are ready .
tr	Nom	You can ' t MAKE them mate , you can only encourage them .
tr	Nom	Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Nom	They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
tr	Nom	When the males aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
tr	Nom	I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
tr	Nom	When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
tr	Nom	Recently she has been peeing A LOT .
tr	Nom	I ' m talking soaking all the litter box and then some .
tr	Nom	She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath .
tr	Nom	I don ' t have the money to take her to a vet right now but it ' s getting to be an issue .
tr	Nom	I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
tr	Nom	What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first ?
tr	Nom	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Nom	First of all , I am very sorry to hear you ' re having this issue with your cat . :(
tr	Nom	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Nom	In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .
tr	Nom	I want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program .
tr	Nom	I got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement .?
tr	Nom	Can i apply with 63 points ?
tr	Nom	"According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / immigrate / skilled / assess / index . asp , it states "" Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing ."""
tr	Nom	"You should check for updated information on a regular basis ."""
tr	Nom	And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
tr	Nom	But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident .
tr	Nom	GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http :// www . canadavisa . com / canadian - immigration - faq - skilled - workers . html .
tr	Nom	Here is what they posted there
tr	Nom	""" 4 . May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points ?"""
tr	Nom	Sure you can apply .
tr	Nom	"Why have a "" minimum "" if it is going to be ignored ?"
tr	Nom	I ' m mad and don ' t know what to do !
tr	Nom	( I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again ) so I fineally checked it , and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida !!!
tr	Nom	I got so excited !!!!
tr	Nom	It said it was in January but still !!!!
tr	Nom	So I kept reading and then I saw the dates , it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday . :(
tr	Nom	then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates .
tr	Nom	( we live in Pennsylvania btw ) I ' m mad and upset now !
tr	Nom	We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days .
tr	Nom	**** sigh **** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really !

tr	Nom	I ' m American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
tr	Nom	I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
tr	Nom	do you get your visitors visa immediately at the airport ?
tr	Nom	I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitors visa .
tr	Nom	do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
tr	Nom	or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
tr	Nom	i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country .
tr	Nom	I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really don ' t have the money for .
tr	Nom	I ' m really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
tr	Nom	You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
tr	Nom	It is free .
tr	Nom	I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U . K .
tr	Nom	You should be fine with just a passport , unless you ' re staying longer than six months .
tr	Nom	You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
tr	Nom	I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
tr	Nom	You ' ll have a great time , so no worries there .
tr	Nom	I visited London , Edinburgh , and St . Andrews so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
tr	Nom	Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you ' ll be fine .
tr	Nom	What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
tr	Nom	i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
tr	Nom	if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks ?
tr	Nom	You don ' t say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can ' t say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
tr	Nom	However , I can say what features they would / could have .
tr	Nom	So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .
tr	Nom	Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
tr	Nom	I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 .
tr	Nom	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Nom	http :// i . imgur . com / S2MD2 . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / T2zff . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / Xytex . jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 ( see links above ).
tr	Nom	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Nom	deleting a question where you dont like the answer won ' t get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
tr	Nom	you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
tr	Nom	[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
tr	Nom	lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
tr	Nom	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Nom	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
tr	Nom	I do like the shadow , though .
tr	Nom	I ' ve had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I didn ' t notice at first .
tr	Nom	As far ask I ’ m aware our most unique custom would be the “ Country Wake ”.
tr	Nom	The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
tr	Nom	I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
tr	Nom	The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
tr	Nom	the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
tr	Nom	I ' m unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn ' t react to seeing another cat on TV .
tr	Nom	I heard that a company ( here is a link : http :// news . yahoo . com / nestl - purina - releases - commercial - aimed - dogs - 183443091 . html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans can ' t hear .
tr	Nom	As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
tr	Nom	If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
tr	Nom	I wouldn ' t know -- I don ' t particularly like scary movies , and I haven ' t tried this with my pet .
tr	Nom	Although , I don ' t think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they ' ll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
tr	Nom	The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
tr	Nom	So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
tr	Nom	Hearing is a dog ’ s secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
tr	Nom	Yes they do .
tr	Nom	im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
tr	Nom	How much should I be looking at for horse transportation ?
tr	Nom	I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
tr	Nom	The place where I ' m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
tr	Nom	So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
tr	Nom	If they ask how much I ' m willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
tr	Nom	I saw a site that charges $ 0 . 70 per mile .
tr	Nom	Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver ' s time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
tr	Nom	Remember that you get what you pay for .
tr	Nom	Three hours isn ' t far , but you are doing multiple shows .
tr	Nom	I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
tr	Nom	He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
tr	Nom	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Nom	All horses I ' ve had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive .
tr	Nom	I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
tr	Nom	Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
tr	Nom	Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
tr	Nom	Do they have this anywhere ?
tr	Nom	I want to take a cruise around the world .
tr	Nom	I mean literally around the world if possible .
tr	Nom	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Nom	Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to ?
tr	Nom	Like you can pick the destinations ?
tr	Nom	But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere .
tr	Nom	"Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high "" single supplement "" costs in addition ."
tr	Nom	You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ).
tr	Nom	HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
tr	Nom	so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40K at least .
tr	Nom	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Nom	As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
tr	Nom	The other ethicities weren ' t well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70 ' s due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
tr	Nom	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Nom	You never saw black MUNI drivers , Asian police , Latino politicians until then .
tr	Nom	It was an evolution .
tr	Nom	We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
tr	Nom	We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then .
tr	Nom	We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
tr	Nom	We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
tr	Nom	I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
tr	Nom	We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
tr	Nom	There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
tr	Nom	However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
tr	Nom	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Nom	So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
tr	Nom	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Nom	I just wanna make sure :) Thank !
tr	Nom	You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , don ' t put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
tr	Nom	yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
tr	Nom	we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
tr	Nom	what am I doing wrong
tr	Nom	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Nom	I ' ll just echo both other answers .
tr	Nom	Molten brass is damn hot and usually it ' s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
tr	Nom	Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
tr	Nom	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Nom	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Nom	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Nom	Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Nom	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e . g . for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ).
tr	Nom	I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Nom	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ).
tr	Nom	I melt brass and cast it http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm
tr	Nom	You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
tr	Nom	I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http :// www . mikegigi . com / meltmetl . htm and http :// www . mikegigi . com / firehole . htm
tr	Nom	They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
tr	Nom	Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
tr	Nom	Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
tr	Nom	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Nom	We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
tr	Nom	Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
tr	Nom	I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
tr	Nom	When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
tr	Nom	I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which weren ' t a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
tr	Nom	I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
tr	Nom	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Nom	Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
tr	Nom	It will become EU law in a couple of years .
tr	Nom	We can ' t dictate what business wants to open where .
tr	Nom	If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
tr	Nom	They don ' t know ANYTHING about Ball pythons .
tr	Nom	When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
tr	Nom	She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
tr	Nom	I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I ' m 14 by the way
tr	Nom	Maybe if they see how much time and effort you ' ve devoted to researching the animal they ' ll reconsider .
tr	Nom	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Nom	Once you ' ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
tr	Nom	2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
tr	Nom	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Nom	Once you ' re there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
tr	Nom	Once you ' re holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
tr	Nom	Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ).
tr	Nom	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Nom	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Nom	I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
tr	Nom	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Nom	I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
tr	Nom	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Nom	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
tr	Nom	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Nom	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Nom	I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane .
tr	Nom	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Nom	I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
tr	Nom	You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
tr	Nom	"It is full of gay friendly "" everything ""."
tr	Nom	But , you could live where ever you fancy takes you .
tr	Nom	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Nom	But , can you immigrate ?
tr	Nom	"A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
tr	Nom	You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
tr	Nom	It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
tr	Nom	IF you have NOT begun the Application process ' s NOW < you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada .
tr	Nom	Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
tr	Nom	You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
tr	Nom	"Being an American and from the "" south "" you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud ."
tr	Nom	I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
tr	Nom	Recently I ' m having trouble training him .
tr	Nom	He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
tr	Nom	And he is not following me when I was walking .
tr	Nom	I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it didn ' t help .
tr	Nom	And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , doesn ' t listen to me .
tr	Nom	He is really excited about anybody he see .
tr	Nom	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Nom	Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
tr	Nom	You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
tr	Nom	This way , he cannot reach the leash to chew it .
tr	Nom	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Nom	Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
tr	Nom	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Nom	You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
tr	Nom	why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
tr	Nom	or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
tr	Nom	or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
tr	Nom	What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs500 per night ?
tr	Nom	I ' m looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
tr	Nom	This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
tr	Nom	Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
tr	Nom	In Delhi I ' d recommend Ajay Guesthouse .
tr	Nom	Must say , in Delhi it ' s hard to get good price / quality rating .
tr	Nom	I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
tr	Nom	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Nom	In Varanasi I don ' t know .
tr	Nom	I ' ve stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
tr	Nom	Also , while travelling ask people where they ' ve been and if they have any hotel recommendations .
tr	Nom	In Agra I ' ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
tr	Nom	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Nom	It was quite easy to find something .
tr	Nom	Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
tr	Nom	You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
tr	Nom	it is in karol bagh .
tr	Nom	it is centrally situated .
tr	Nom	I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
tr	Nom	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
tr	Nom	So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
tr	Nom	( plus they dont stink that bad )
tr	Nom	Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
tr	Nom	Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
tr	Nom	I ' ve had experience with all of those pets except Degus .
tr	Nom	They ' re incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
tr	Nom	The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
tr	Nom	That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
tr	Nom	They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
tr	Nom	I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
tr	Nom	I ' ve never met a hamster that didn ' t bite me .
tr	Nom	We have two .
tr	Nom	They are social and like to be handled .
tr	Nom	You have to have two because they don ' t do well alone .
tr	Nom	Make certain you get two females .
tr	Nom	Two males can fight and you definitely don ' t want babies !!
tr	Nom	They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
tr	Nom	They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots .
tr	Nom	Also they can ' t eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
tr	Nom	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Nom	Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT !
tr	Nom	I wanted to volunteer and help animals , and decided to try fostering kittens .
tr	Nom	I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
tr	Nom	They track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed ....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything , including my bare legs !
tr	Nom	I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
tr	Nom	That ' s kind of the way it goes .. lol .
tr	Nom	If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
tr	Nom	Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
tr	Nom	They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
tr	Nom	For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
tr	Nom	Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator .
tr	Nom	They made need medication or deworming or something .
tr	Nom	They are testing out their claws and teeth .
tr	Nom	To some degree you can / should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately .
tr	Nom	But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ' ll be interacting with the kittens .
tr	Nom	Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
tr	Nom	If you still don ' t enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
tr	Nom	They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
tr	Nom	I find the adults are much easier .
tr	Nom	Generally they ' re not clawing and biting , they don ' t make nearly as much mess , they don ' t need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
tr	Nom	And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
tr	Nom	It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
tr	Nom	Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child ' s birth at the town hall / registrar ' s office .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Nom	Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
tr	Nom	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Nom	If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , its simple to do it over the computer .
tr	Nom	For $ 56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
tr	Nom	You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
tr	Nom	None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .
tr	Nom	they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
tr	Nom	You can probably do it all on - line .
tr	Nom	Start here if you were born in Ontario .
tr	Nom	If you were born elsewhere , start here .
tr	Nom	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Nom	I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
tr	Nom	As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
tr	Nom	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Nom	ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD * BOTH * !!
tr	Nom	i want to know which you liked better and WHY ?
tr	Nom	- AND JUST MORE STUFF YOU LIKED OVERALL
tr	Nom	We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don ' t believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
tr	Nom	Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
tr	Nom	We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
tr	Nom	On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
tr	Nom	If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
tr	Nom	Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Nom	We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Nom	We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
tr	Nom	We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
tr	Nom	They both had pools for kids and adults .
tr	Nom	We liked the Liberty ' s pools better because one had a slide .
tr	Nom	If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
tr	Nom	Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
tr	Nom	We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Nom	Usually you can ' t go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
tr	Nom	I really want to travel when I leave school !
tr	Nom	Where in the states could I go ?
tr	Nom	Have you every traveled before ?
tr	Nom	How long should I go for to each place ?
tr	Nom	( I Have 1 year before collage !)
tr	Nom	& Also how much money would I need ?
tr	Nom	So I can start saving now hehe
tr	Nom	I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
tr	Nom	Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you ' ve never traveled before and you don ' t put where you would be traveling from .
tr	Nom	What do you like to do ?
tr	Nom	Do you speak a foreign language ?
tr	Nom	I could spend a year in Spain alone .
tr	Nom	I ' ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
tr	Nom	Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
tr	Nom	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Nom	Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ' ll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you ' re there .
tr	Nom	I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
tr	Nom	You can ' t beat the price for what you get .
tr	Nom	How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
tr	Nom	We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
tr	Nom	We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it .
tr	Nom	How could we make it settle in a new house .
tr	Nom	you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
tr	Nom	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Nom	you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
tr	Nom	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Nom	you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
tr	Nom	the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ), but others will work just as well .
tr	Nom	he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
tr	Nom	he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
tr	Nom	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Nom	in a week ' s time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
tr	Nom	he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .
tr	Nom	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Nom	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Nom	he might even start peeing on things in fear .
tr	Nom	In time though she / he will adjust . :)
tr	Nom	they just do it on their own .
tr	Nom	I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
tr	Nom	Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
tr	Nom	( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
tr	Nom	I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
tr	Nom	I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wont work .
tr	Nom	He wont even get close to the crate .
tr	Nom	If I come towards him , he will run away .
tr	Nom	How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
tr	Nom	He wont do anything on command .
tr	Nom	Its very frustrating .
tr	Nom	I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
tr	Nom	I trained her myself .
tr	Nom	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .
tr	Nom	I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog .
tr	Nom	She tosses me around like its nothing !
tr	Nom	... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
tr	Nom	Is there any tricks I could use ?
tr	Nom	You have to be in command at all times .
tr	Nom	I would start with a leash .
tr	Nom	At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
tr	Nom	If you push it , it will never work .
tr	Nom	He will learn to really like this .
tr	Nom	where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
tr	Nom	will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
tr	Nom	I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
tr	Nom	Should I just settle and book on line ?
tr	Nom	or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
tr	Nom	If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
tr	Nom	If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
tr	Nom	The are located right at 248 De Than St . in the heart of the back packer district .
tr	Nom	I have taken this tour and it was great .
tr	Nom	I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
tr	Nom	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Nom	And no , I do not work for them . :)
tr	Nom	I am just a satisfied customer .
tr	Nom	Oh , if you are confused .
tr	Nom	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Nom	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Nom	If you ' re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
tr	Nom	From either of those cities , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
tr	Nom	Most of the tourists that I ' ve come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
tr	Nom	You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
tr	Nom	The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
tr	Nom	PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken ' s hotel .
tr	Nom	It ' s called Kiwi Heaven and it ' s across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
tr	Nom	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Nom	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Nom	He ' ll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
tr	Nom	Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
tr	Nom	We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
tr	Nom	We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
tr	Nom	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Nom	I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
tr	Nom	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Nom	I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
tr	Nom	Because I don ' t feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
tr	Nom	I also have back problems that transfer into my legs .
tr	Nom	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Nom	Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
tr	Nom	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Nom	Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
tr	Nom	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Nom	BTW you dont want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
tr	Nom	When I first started doing it I ' d do it every day .
tr	Nom	Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
tr	Nom	what are you having problems with ?
tr	Nom	i wouldn ' t bother with yoga i ' d practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , theres also a way to ride on your knees ?
tr	Nom	ya i really wouldn ' t bother with the yoga
tr	Nom	You don ' t want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
tr	Nom	I really can ' t help you .
tr	Nom	He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight .
tr	Nom	I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water .
tr	Nom	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Nom	The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
tr	Nom	Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
tr	Nom	I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it .. what should i do ?
tr	Nom	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Nom	They didnt take x - rays they offered them but i just couldnt afford anymore treatment .
tr	Nom	I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
tr	Nom	I will give them and call and see what they say .
tr	Nom	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Nom	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Nom	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .
tr	Nom	1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
tr	Nom	However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
tr	Nom	He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
tr	Nom	3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
tr	Nom	It could be due to nausea or any number of things .
tr	Nom	He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ).
tr	Nom	From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .
tr	Nom	They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
tr	Nom	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
tr	Nom	You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about .
tr	Nom	They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
tr	Nom	You need to ask your vet these questions .
tr	Nom	Did they do any x - rays ?
tr	Nom	I don ' t know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
tr	Nom	You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
tr	Nom	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
tr	Nom	I ' m in my 20 ' s and currently studying in France .
tr	Nom	However , I ' ve read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
tr	Nom	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
tr	Nom	They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
tr	Nom	Is it true ?
tr	Nom	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Nom	She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
tr	Nom	She is also nicer when we are both alone .
tr	Nom	However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
tr	Nom	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
tr	Nom	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
tr	Nom	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
tr	Nom	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Nom	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Nom	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
tr	Nom	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
tr	Nom	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
tr	Nom	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
tr	Nom	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
tr	Nom	Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
tr	Nom	""" Non !"" means "" non "", not "" I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case ."""
tr	Nom	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
tr	Nom	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there ' s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
tr	Nom	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Nom	If she is nicer when you are alone I ' d say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
tr	Nom	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Nom	Should have done research before you left .
tr	Nom	I ' m just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
tr	Nom	I ' m two years into an undergraduate degree .
tr	Nom	Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
tr	Nom	I really like you ' re answer .
tr	Nom	it ' s very logical .
tr	Nom	I ' ve also considered becoming a teacher , but it ' s not a job I ' m cut out for .
tr	Nom	I also wish I ' d applied for a scholarship .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t think I ' d be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
tr	Nom	Obviously I ' m still completely stupid though .
tr	Nom	I mean , I wasn ' t smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
tr	Nom	And yes , I am being melodramatic .
tr	Nom	* gasps * So I wouldn ' t make a good prostitute ?
tr	Nom	Are you saying I ' m bad in bed ?
tr	Nom	How would you know ?
tr	Nom	I ' m studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I ' m done .
tr	Nom	I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I ' ll be employable .
tr	Nom	I ' ve also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
tr	Nom	I also know that you don ' t get paid that much more in Australia than you do here .
tr	Nom	And it ' s not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
tr	Nom	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
tr	Nom	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Nom	And they ' ll probably add interest to what you ' ve already racked up .
tr	Nom	And they ' re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
tr	Nom	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they ' ll force you cough up .
tr	Nom	And all that time you ' re overseas you ' ll be racking up interest .
tr	Nom	I wouldn ' t like not having the option to return to NZ .
tr	Nom	I guess I ' m extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree .
tr	Nom	But I worked hard and I ' m still working hard .
tr	Nom	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
tr	Nom	I ' m doing fine .
tr	Nom	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Nom	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it ' s not anything new .
tr	Nom	It depends on what you hunger for .
tr	Nom	i have a baby eastern king snake .
tr	Nom	i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
tr	Nom	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Nom	as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
tr	Nom	according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
tr	Nom	he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
tr	Nom	( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won ' t eat .)
tr	Nom	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Nom	i handle him every few days .
tr	Nom	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Nom	i just love him to death .
tr	Nom	i don ' t know why he won ' t eat though !
tr	Nom	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
tr	Nom	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
tr	Nom	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Nom	he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
tr	Nom	he doesn ' t seem to know that they are food .
tr	Nom	"i have tried "" braining "" both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he doesn ' t care ."
tr	Nom	i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
tr	Nom	i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake ' s face .
tr	Nom	he wont even try to bite .
tr	Nom	i am very discouraged and sad and i don ' t know what to do .
tr	Nom	he hasn ' t eaten in an entire month .
tr	Nom	i ' ve only tried to feed him one at a time .
tr	Nom	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Nom	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
tr	Nom	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
tr	Nom	If he doesn ' t seem interested in them at all I would say he ' s just not hungry .
tr	Nom	They can smell it so i ' m sure he knows what it is and just don ' t want it .
tr	Nom	In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
tr	Nom	They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
tr	Nom	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
tr	Nom	It ' s natural and so long as you don ' t see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
tr	Nom	You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
tr	Nom	They ' re fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
tr	Nom	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Nom	It ' s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
tr	Nom	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Nom	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Nom	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Nom	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
tr	Nom	were they roughhouse playing ?
tr	Nom	or were they actually fighting ?
tr	Nom	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Nom	you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
tr	Nom	you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
tr	Nom	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn ' t now .
tr	Nom	she knows she is invading someone else ' s territory , but can ' t help it , and has no where to go .
tr	Nom	she will be able to sleep without being afraid .
tr	Nom	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Nom	you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
tr	Nom	when they play fight , they don ' t hiss .
tr	Nom	if they hiss , they are not playing .
tr	Nom	if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .
tr	Nom	hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .
tr	Nom	It means they ' ve gone too far .
tr	Nom	When they start bleeding that means they ' re really fighting .
tr	Nom	If they ' re going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as they can ), and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as they can with their paws ) then they ' re playing .
tr	Nom	I have two cats , and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
tr	Nom	The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
tr	Nom	That means they are fighting .
tr	Nom	When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing .
tr	Nom	I can see how you get confused though . :)
tr	Nom	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
tr	Nom	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Nom	He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
tr	Nom	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Nom	Thing is , it worked .
tr	Nom	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ).
tr	Nom	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Nom	They could not defeat the Americans .
tr	Nom	However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
tr	Nom	The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
tr	Nom	When give the ultimate choice , they rallied …
tr	Nom	They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
tr	Nom	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Nom	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Nom	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Nom	They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it .
tr	Nom	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Nom	In that , they pretty much succeeded .
tr	Nom	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Nom	Try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
tr	Nom	I just bought a baby one yesterday .
tr	Nom	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Nom	I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
tr	Nom	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Nom	He ' s getting used to his new home , but hasn ' t eatin yet .
tr	Nom	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
tr	Nom	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
tr	Nom	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
tr	Nom	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Nom	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
tr	Nom	Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
tr	Nom	I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly :
tr	Nom	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Nom	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Nom	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Nom	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Nom	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Nom	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Nom	Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so its anyone ' s guess whether or not he ' ll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
tr	Nom	I tell all my customers they can try it , but don ' t count on it .
tr	Nom	I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
tr	Nom	I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
tr	Nom	I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
tr	Nom	At first it was all cool and all .
tr	Nom	They were chirping and doing their every day business .
tr	Nom	After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
tr	Nom	They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them .
tr	Nom	Ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed .
tr	Nom	They dont want to be held or touched .
tr	Nom	I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
tr	Nom	I still have them and they are doing well .
tr	Nom	A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
tr	Nom	They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
tr	Nom	I love them .
tr	Nom	First of all they are very tame .
tr	Nom	I tamed them in 4 days .
tr	Nom	They can do tricks and they arent messy .
tr	Nom	They are a big part of our family .
tr	Nom	I hope this helps you with your decision .
tr	Nom	They are both about the same noise level .
tr	Nom	If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
tr	Nom	I would recommend that you get two parakeets .
tr	Nom	They sometimes dont get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
tr	Nom	I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
tr	Nom	They are the best !
tr	Nom	If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
tr	Nom	However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
tr	Nom	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Nom	These are the steps I used .
tr	Nom	Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets .
tr	Nom	Hopefully they will work for you .
tr	Nom	1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
tr	Nom	I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
tr	Nom	Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
tr	Nom	( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
tr	Nom	This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them .
tr	Nom	( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
tr	Nom	3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .
tr	Nom	( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food )....
tr	Nom	( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
tr	Nom	When they see that you arnt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .
tr	Nom	4 ) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying .
tr	Nom	You have patience .
tr	Nom	After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
tr	Nom	and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
tr	Nom	They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !
tr	Nom	They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Nom	They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
tr	Nom	They are also friendly .
tr	Nom	I have a parakeet named Cookie . : P
tr	Nom	I graduate in the spring , and so we ' d like to go between then and winter .
tr	Nom	We don ' t want too many tourists , and since we ' ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
tr	Nom	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Nom	We ' re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we ' re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
tr	Nom	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Nom	One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
tr	Nom	It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
tr	Nom	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Nom	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Nom	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Nom	Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid - July – again , it ’ s all part of the uncertainty principle .
tr	Nom	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Nom	If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
tr	Nom	The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ?).
tr	Nom	It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
tr	Nom	Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
tr	Nom	To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don ' t have a bus or train service .
tr	Nom	You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
tr	Nom	By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
tr	Nom	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
tr	Nom	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Nom	We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
tr	Nom	The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
tr	Nom	We had frosts in October so I wouldn ' t advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
tr	Nom	You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
tr	Nom	You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
tr	Nom	Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe .
tr	Nom	I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish .
tr	Nom	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Nom	I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday .
tr	Nom	Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies ?
tr	Nom	If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive !
tr	Nom	I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
tr	Nom	I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males .
tr	Nom	If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below .
tr	Nom	If you have plants in your tank .
tr	Nom	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Nom	( I ' ve even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer !
tr	Nom	If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .
tr	Nom	I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .
tr	Nom	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Nom	Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .
tr	Nom	With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
tr	Nom	Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .
tr	Nom	They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
tr	Nom	You also may need to treat the incubation water .
tr	Nom	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Nom	2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes ?
tr	Nom	That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .
tr	Nom	Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .
tr	Nom	They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ).
tr	Nom	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Nom	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
tr	Nom	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Nom	If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
tr	Nom	I will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds .
tr	Nom	Should I get a balcony ?
tr	Nom	It is vacation time .
tr	Nom	They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
tr	Nom	Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids , which best suit you can select ?
tr	Nom	Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
tr	Nom	Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
tr	Nom	It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
tr	Nom	They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
tr	Nom	It is really an entertainment for the kids .
tr	Nom	You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
tr	Nom	I would suggest a warmer season , but not Spring Break or early summer .
tr	Nom	You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays .
tr	Nom	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Nom	With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
tr	Nom	Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
tr	Nom	They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
tr	Nom	We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
tr	Nom	You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
tr	Nom	Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
tr	Nom	Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
tr	Nom	We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we ' had ' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
tr	Nom	We had a ball .
tr	Nom	We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
tr	Nom	There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
tr	Nom	The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones .
tr	Nom	You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
tr	Nom	If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
tr	Nom	The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
tr	Nom	Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
tr	Nom	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Nom	If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
tr	Nom	but food is always available and it is consistently good .
tr	Nom	I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
tr	Nom	That ' s why I ' m posting here !
tr	Nom	I posted this in singles and dating too , so I ' ve just copied and pasted .
tr	Nom	Well , I ' ll try to make this short .
tr	Nom	I have known this guy for a long time , but we ' ve never been good friends or anything .
tr	Nom	He is my farrier ( shoes my horses feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
tr	Nom	Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty .
tr	Nom	He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
tr	Nom	We were also just talking about my horse ' s crappy feet and he mentioned .
tr	Nom	""" Well , if you ever just want to see me I ' ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after ."""
tr	Nom	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Nom	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Nom	He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
tr	Nom	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Nom	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
tr	Nom	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Nom	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Nom	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Nom	It ' s a father and son business .
tr	Nom	Anyway , I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all .
tr	Nom	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Nom	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Nom	This is about the fourth time they ' ve done my horse ' s feet because I just switched back to them .
tr	Nom	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Nom	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Nom	Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
tr	Nom	So , obviously I switched back to these guys .
tr	Nom	Ok , calm down , it ' s not like he ' s some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
tr	Nom	I ' ve known the guy for about 10 years .
tr	Nom	I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
tr	Nom	He is a few years older than me .
tr	Nom	And yes , I do like him .
tr	Nom	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Nom	And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
tr	Nom	I ' ve never done that before though either .
tr	Nom	"It ' s always just "" Okay , they ' re feet need to be done , better call the farrier ."""
tr	Nom	And they usually come out within a few days .
tr	Nom	He will call you back Im sure !
tr	Nom	Sounds like He really likes you ..
tr	Nom	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
tr	Nom	would You like going for * coffee * with him ?
tr	Nom	or is he Not your type ?
tr	Nom	Or are you undecided ?
tr	Nom	If i were you I would Go ...
tr	Nom	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
tr	Nom	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
tr	Nom	Edit ... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing ..
tr	Nom	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
tr	Nom	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
tr	Nom	When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby ..( for those who don ' t Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
tr	Nom	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Nom	sorta wonder what it would have been like ?
tr	Nom	He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
tr	Nom	Well one day he said to me You know i don ' t wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
tr	Nom	Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn ' t see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
tr	Nom	Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
tr	Nom	I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
tr	Nom	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Nom	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Nom	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Nom	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Nom	From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he ' s doing a really shitty job .
tr	Nom	Leaving nails out so you ' ll call and have him come back out later ?
tr	Nom	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Nom	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Nom	He ' s not lame , but he ' s been having issues .
tr	Nom	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Nom	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Nom	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
tr	Nom	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ).
tr	Nom	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
tr	Nom	He can eat all his feed and doesn ' t drop any , but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
tr	Nom	He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .
tr	Nom	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Nom	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
tr	Nom	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
tr	Nom	NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .
tr	Nom	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
tr	Nom	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
tr	Nom	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
tr	Nom	So I might get the horse and see what I can do .
tr	Nom	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
tr	Nom	I ' ll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....
tr	Nom	Think I should do it ?
tr	Nom	I will be calling my vet and chiro about him .
tr	Nom	Worse comes to worse , I ' m out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
tr	Nom	He ' s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
tr	Nom	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Nom	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
tr	Nom	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Nom	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Nom	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Nom	I am not going to go pick up a horse I can ' t afford .
tr	Nom	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
tr	Nom	I will also be having my other vet up who ' s a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
tr	Nom	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Nom	He ' s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn ' t be related ).
tr	Nom	He ' s not starving .
tr	Nom	He ' s dropping we
tr	Nom	He ' s not starving .
tr	Nom	He ' s dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days .
tr	Nom	He ' s not putting it back on .
tr	Nom	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
tr	Nom	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
tr	Nom	I know this is going to be expensive .
tr	Nom	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Nom	Gallop , I ' ve already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .
tr	Nom	I will have the EPM test done before treating .
tr	Nom	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Nom	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Nom	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Nom	Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .
tr	Nom	Is that something you are up for ?
tr	Nom	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Nom	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
tr	Nom	As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we ' ve had to deal with it .
tr	Nom	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
tr	Nom	That horse returned to racing and we didn ' t notice much difference .
tr	Nom	We ' ve had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
tr	Nom	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Nom	I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .
tr	Nom	We ' ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .
tr	Nom	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
tr	Nom	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know .
tr	Nom	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Nom	You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study .
tr	Nom	I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM .
tr	Nom	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Nom	Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?
tr	Nom	You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I don ' t think I could take in a horse right now these issues .
tr	Nom	Personally I think you should just keep on walking by .
tr	Nom	You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .
tr	Nom	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Nom	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
tr	Nom	Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy ?
tr	Nom	Was it always like this ?
tr	Nom	Or has it occurred since birth .
tr	Nom	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Nom	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
tr	Nom	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Nom	Do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get your hair straightened .
tr	Nom	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .
tr	Nom	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Nom	He knows what hes doing .
tr	Nom	We just had our wedding on 11 / 7 / 08 and was very impressed .
tr	Nom	Cj and company did all that we ask and 10 times more .

tr	Nom	I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
tr	Nom	So long Hams ... you will be missed .
tr	Nom	We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
tr	Nom	We called few companies before we decide to hire them .
tr	Nom	They came on time and completed their work quickly .
tr	Nom	We were very happy how clean looked our windows .
tr	Nom	If you have some problems with your windows , you should call them .
tr	Nom	I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers !
tr	Nom	I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
tr	Nom	They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes .
tr	Nom	I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
tr	Nom	I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut .
tr	Nom	When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
tr	Nom	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Nom	I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed .
tr	Nom	No matter what state I am in when I arrive , I always leave feeling better .
tr	Nom	She has not only helped me through some challenging computer - work and sports related injuries , she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend her .
tr	Nom	What a fantastic store , I love this place .
tr	Nom	They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
tr	Nom	She is and excellent doctor to have on one ' s team .
tr	Nom	Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST !
tr	Nom	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
tr	Nom	He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
tr	Nom	I will reccommend his services however / whenever possible !
tr	Nom	I ' ve had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers .
tr	Nom	I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
tr	Nom	They set out to exceed your expectations .
tr	Nom	Already I ' m considering future projects , and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing .
tr	Nom	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
tr	Nom	They have messed up my order and .... The food was just not good !
tr	Nom	I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
tr	Nom	I hope they get there act together ...
tr	Nom	I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see ??
tr	Nom	I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS .
tr	Nom	THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY .
tr	Nom	PLEASE DON ' T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DON ' T WANT TO : CRY , HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE .
tr	Nom	THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE , I GUARANTEE IT .
tr	Nom	You ' ve Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
tr	Nom	I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
tr	Nom	Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just cant find in a lot of stores .
tr	Nom	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
tr	Nom	I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
tr	Nom	Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it .
tr	Nom	I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
tr	Nom	I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago .
tr	Nom	I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago
tr	Nom	I wanted to try someplace new again .
tr	Nom	We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
tr	Nom	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Nom	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
tr	Nom	I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
tr	Nom	I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
tr	Nom	I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like its getting infected .
tr	Nom	I ' m certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong .
tr	Nom	This town needs some food soul and this is not it .
tr	Nom	Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection , and was presented perfectly .
tr	Nom	The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
tr	Nom	Then the desserts came , and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had .
tr	Nom	I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
tr	Nom	It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Nom	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Nom	Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
tr	Nom	Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
tr	Nom	I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
tr	Nom	John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
tr	Nom	If you need someone to help you out with your heating problems , I DEFINITELY would call TIGER HEATING and AIR .
tr	Nom	They Suck
tr	Nom	After searching high and low for a salesman , I was treated like dirt , and we left .
tr	Nom	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
tr	Nom	Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else .
tr	Nom	He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home !
tr	Nom	We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close .
tr	Nom	As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
tr	Nom	However , I still like this place a lot .
tr	Nom	It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
tr	Nom	They fixed the queso !
tr	Nom	I had the morelias enchiladas .
tr	Nom	Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
tr	Nom	Service was okay not great , we came for a late lunch .
tr	Nom	I don ' t recommend this place .
tr	Nom	James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
tr	Nom	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
tr	Nom	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Nom	When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tr	Nom	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
tr	Nom	I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I ' ve had with bigger offices and firms .
tr	Nom	While I hope I don ' t have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I ' ll definitely use this firm again .
tr	Nom	I LOVE MY GYM !
tr	Nom	If you are serious about working out in a non - commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be .
tr	Nom	This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body don ' t be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
tr	Nom	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Nom	I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
tr	Nom	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
tr	Nom	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
tr	Nom	I ' m very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .
tr	Nom	When i say jiu - jitsu or mma i mean it !
tr	Nom	Best jiu - jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up !
tr	Nom	When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday !
tr	Nom	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Nom	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Nom	They are very rude over the phone and in person .
tr	Nom	They talk down to you like they are supreme beings , if you hate your job so much then quit !!
tr	Nom	I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again .
tr	Nom	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
tr	Nom	They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty .
tr	Nom	I enjoy going there although i ' ve only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
tr	Nom	i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
tr	Nom	Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
tr	Nom	A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
tr	Nom	They don ' t seem to be interested in selling cars .
tr	Nom	Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
tr	Nom	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
tr	Nom	We were the only customers there !
tr	Nom	Don ' t waste time , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help their customers there !
tr	Nom	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
tr	Nom	SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
tr	Nom	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
tr	Nom	IF YOU WANT A STEAK , WELL , THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY .
tr	Nom	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
tr	Nom	If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
tr	Nom	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Nom	I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
tr	Nom	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I ' ma bit surprised by other comments .
tr	Nom	She ' s very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
tr	Nom	Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
tr	Nom	I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
tr	Nom	They have the best prices locally and good customer service .
tr	Nom	AND they ' re usually able to help you as a walk - in , and they ' re fast .
tr	Nom	A bit pricey , so I didn ' t go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
tr	Nom	The prices were worth what I got .
tr	Nom	I ' m assuming they are completely out of business since I can ' t find any contact information .
tr	Nom	I ' m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
tr	Nom	What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you ' re in a small town rather than Baltimore .
tr	Nom	The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
tr	Nom	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
tr	Nom	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
tr	Nom	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I ' ll definitely order a steak .
tr	Nom	They interviewed me , gave me tests in the software I included on my resume , and placed me in a position that I kept for several years .
tr	Nom	I ' m really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
tr	Nom	They are dependable , have great connections in the community , and are a great resource for finding a job .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend them to all of my friends !!!!!
tr	Nom	I adopted a 3 . 5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
tr	Nom	If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don ' t forget to check out the shelters !
tr	Nom	Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got it .
tr	Nom	Only one server , too buys talking with others I guess .
tr	Nom	Dr . Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had .
tr	Nom	You are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
tr	Nom	I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now , However I am glad you are my dentist now .
tr	Nom	Even though you are expensive .
tr	Nom	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
tr	Nom	I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
tr	Nom	I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car wouldn ' t pass unless I replaced a hose .
tr	Nom	Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
tr	Nom	If you ' re a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
tr	Nom	even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
tr	Nom	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
tr	Nom	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
tr	Nom	I don ' t want to waste my time with them .
tr	Nom	So here we are in Manson .
tr	Nom	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Nom	If you must use them , be vigilant and be ready to push , if you can go elsewhere then I would .
tr	Nom	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Nom	Check out The Willow Lounge , youll be happy !
tr	Nom	Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
tr	Nom	And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
tr	Nom	I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser ' s .
tr	Nom	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend Fraiser ' s for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
tr	Nom	I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
tr	Nom	It ' s located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
tr	Nom	Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
tr	Nom	I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
tr	Nom	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Nom	We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
tr	Nom	I recommend them highly !
tr	Nom	I ' m compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
tr	Nom	They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS , they will NOT take it back !
tr	Nom	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
tr	Nom	And they THRIVE to get a customer .
tr	Nom	I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
tr	Nom	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Nom	This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
tr	Nom	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
tr	Nom	I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already .
tr	Nom	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
tr	Nom	Don ' t go , or you will learn how to waste your money .
tr	Nom	The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
tr	Nom	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
tr	Nom	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
tr	Nom	If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were .
tr	Nom	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Nom	We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it ' s worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
tr	Nom	This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
tr	Nom	It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
tr	Nom	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
tr	Nom	I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
tr	Nom	I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
tr	Nom	I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
tr	Nom	They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
tr	Nom	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
tr	Nom	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
tr	Nom	I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired , I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
tr	Nom	You will be happy at this store !
tr	Nom	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Nom	They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
tr	Nom	Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car !
tr	Nom	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
tr	Nom	I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
tr	Nom	"I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ..."" the inspection guy isn ' t here today "".... for example ."
tr	Nom	Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection ... but I was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had time to read a chapter in my book .
tr	Nom	She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
tr	Nom	We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley .
tr	Nom	We appreciated her patience , knowledge and kindness !
tr	Nom	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Nom	I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
tr	Nom	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
tr	Nom	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you ' ll be good .
tr	Nom	Took a bite , it tasted odd .
tr	Nom	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Nom	She also refused to get a manager .
tr	Nom	I left my number , or tried to anyway .
tr	Nom	I ' ll never go back there again
tr	Nom	I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .
tr	Nom	Now , I won ' t eat fast food Chinese unless it ' s from this place .
tr	Nom	The best value I ' ve found from a Chinese restaurant .
tr	Nom	I don ' t live in Lake St . Louis anymore , but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous .
tr	Nom	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin ' : sadface :
tr	Nom	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
tr	Nom	Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
tr	Nom	I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
tr	Nom	Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
tr	Nom	In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I ' m already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
tr	Nom	We love our new roof !
tr	Nom	We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
tr	Nom	We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job everyday .
tr	Nom	We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
tr	Nom	We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
tr	Nom	I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
tr	Nom	ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
tr	Nom	I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already !
tr	Nom	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere , amazing food , and great customer service !
tr	Nom	This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
tr	Nom	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Nom	I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
tr	Nom	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
tr	Nom	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Nom	I would recommend these apartments to anybody !
tr	Nom	I absolutely LOVED living there .
tr	Nom	I have never had better service .
tr	Nom	They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .
tr	Nom	I give this dealer an A +!
tr	Nom	I will definitely be bringing my car back for service .
tr	Nom	I HATED SUSHI BEFORE BUT NOW I CANT STOP EATTING IT !!!!!!!
tr	Nom	I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK .
tr	Nom	THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS .
tr	Nom	JUNO AND OPEN I LOVE YOU GUYS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Nom	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ), but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
tr	Nom	Do we need another one ?
tr	Nom	Only if it is of the quality of That ' s Amore .
tr	Nom	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Nom	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I ' m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
tr	Nom	Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used .
tr	Nom	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
tr	Nom	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
tr	Nom	They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services .
tr	Nom	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
tr	Nom	As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
tr	Nom	They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
tr	Nom	We love T ' s Cafe !
tr	Nom	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
tr	Nom	If you ' ve been to North County , chances are it ' s in your favorites list already .
tr	Nom	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
tr	Nom	They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
tr	Nom	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Nom	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Nom	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
tr	Nom	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Nom	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
tr	Nom	I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
tr	Nom	I rated it 5 stars .
tr	Nom	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Nom	I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
tr	Nom	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Nom	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Nom	They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet .
tr	Nom	You will also have the pleasure of learning the Italiano language .
tr	Nom	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
tr	Nom	I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
tr	Nom	I ' ve never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
tr	Nom	I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
tr	Nom	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
tr	Nom	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
tr	Nom	They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won ' t hurt my score .
tr	Nom	Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
tr	Nom	If you ' re looking to buy a car , definitely give them a call .
tr	Nom	They have a huge inventory .
tr	Nom	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Nom	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Nom	Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
tr	Nom	As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
tr	Nom	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Nom	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
tr	Nom	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Nom	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Nom	I would recommend him to everyone !
tr	Nom	This school is the worst one i ' ve ever been to .
tr	Nom	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Nom	The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they don ' t listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student ' s ).
tr	Nom	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
tr	Nom	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Nom	( I ' ve been through at least 5 places already .)
tr	Nom	If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
tr	Nom	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
tr	Nom	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Nom	The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if your looking fot a good game and aren ' ta nerd , dont ask them .
tr	Nom	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
tr	Nom	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn ' ta fps .
tr	Nom	He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
tr	Nom	Overall they aren ' t very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
tr	Nom	First and Last time we ' ll eat there
tr	Nom	We both kept trying to find something we liked .
tr	Nom	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Nom	I am not a client of liquidweb . com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
tr	Nom	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Nom	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
tr	Nom	The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
tr	Nom	I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb . com
tr	Nom	You have been awarded the converted Hino Dealer of the Year !
tr	Nom	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
tr	Nom	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you ' ll love Vetri .
tr	Nom	Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I ' ve ever eaten ( and I ' ve eaten a lot ).
tr	Nom	I ' ve dined at lots of high - end restaurants and I ' ve never before felt my money was so well spent .
tr	Nom	I ' ve been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
tr	Nom	They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
tr	Nom	The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
tr	Nom	There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you ' d like .
tr	Nom	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Nom	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
tr	Nom	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
tr	Nom	He was patient and adapted when everything didn ' t go according to schedule on my wedding day .
tr	Nom	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Nom	He got the pictures back to me quickly .
tr	Nom	I would highly recommend David to anyone .
tr	Nom	He will exceed your expectations !
tr	Nom	He doesn ' t just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won ' t even notice that there ' s a camera there .
tr	Nom	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Nom	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
tr	Nom	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Nom	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Nom	I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
tr	Nom	The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
tr	Nom	Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
tr	Nom	It ' s pretty ridiculous !
tr	Nom	They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
tr	Nom	They don ' t care one bit about you !!!!!
tr	Nom	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
tr	Nom	When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy didn ' t know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
tr	Nom	Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
tr	Nom	I will NEVER do business with this company !
tr	Nom	"I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "" AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ."
tr	Nom	"I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS "" Wow , can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles ."
tr	Nom	As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
tr	Nom	"I brought a car in to have the "" check engine "" light diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
tr	Nom	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Nom	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Nom	I did the work myself for $ 50 .
tr	Nom	# 1 its immaculately clean .
tr	Nom	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
tr	Nom	TRY THIS PLACE - YOU ' LL LOVE IT .
tr	Nom	Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
tr	Nom	I came in and saw Dr . Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
tr	Nom	I have to tell you that I haven ' t had one and don ' t want one .
tr	Nom	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
tr	Nom	I sent a customer of mine to you .
tr	Nom	Dr . Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
tr	Nom	I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before .
tr	Nom	I can ' t thank you enough .
tr	Nom	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Nom	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates .
tr	Nom	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
tr	Nom	I am a licensed mental health counselor and I work with variety of mental health problems .
tr	Nom	I offer compassionate , approachable and personalized counseling services .
tr	Nom	I am a preferred provider with most insurance companies .
tr	Nom	I would appreciate reviews from anyone who has worked with me before in the mental health setting .
tr	Nom	If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you ' ll love this zoo .
tr	Nom	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Nom	They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
tr	Nom	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Nom	I can ' t say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
tr	Nom	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
tr	Nom	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Nom	She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
tr	Nom	You should give her a try - it ' s worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
tr	Nom	Worst Service I ' ve Ever Experienced
tr	Nom	I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there isn ' t .
tr	Nom	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Nom	I ' d recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store .
tr	Nom	I have been shopping there for over six years now .
tr	Nom	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Nom	I wouldn ' t go there again .
tr	Nom	From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
tr	Nom	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Nom	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Nom	I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
tr	Nom	I love the location and the apartment !!
tr	Nom	I ' ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
tr	Nom	Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that ' s going to be anywhere you go !
tr	Nom	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
tr	Nom	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Nom	I know that ' s ugly ... but she won ' t help you out for anything ... sad story .
tr	Nom	Other than that , I would recommend living here . :)
tr	Nom	She may be the reason for all the change .
tr	Nom	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
tr	Nom	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Nom	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Nom	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Nom	I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
tr	Nom	I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
tr	Nom	It would have been more than one could bear !
tr	Nom	I hope to be back !
tr	Nom	really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I ' d stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
tr	Nom	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
tr	Nom	"grey shirt "" mark "" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing ....."
tr	Nom	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
tr	Nom	It ' s not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
tr	Nom	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Nom	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Nom	I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal .
tr	Nom	They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
tr	Nom	I cannot say enough about this place .
tr	Nom	They have restored my faith in Mechanics .
tr	Nom	We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
tr	Nom	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Nom	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I ' m sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
tr	Nom	OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
tr	Nom	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Nom	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
tr	Nom	I was very pleased with my experience here .
tr	Nom	I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
tr	Nom	She did a great job !
tr	Nom	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Nom	I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
tr	Nom	You will not be disappointed !!!!!!
tr	Nom	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Nom	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Nom	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don ' t let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
tr	Nom	I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
tr	Nom	Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
tr	Nom	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Nom	The finest Christmas Trees i ' ve ever seen .
tr	Nom	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
tr	Nom	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals .
tr	Nom	This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
tr	Nom	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
tr	Nom	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
tr	Nom	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I ' ve always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
tr	Nom	remember to bring cash since they don ' t take debit or credit .
tr	Nom	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Nom	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Nom	I normally don ' t write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one won ' t be getting my business , nor my family ' s , nor my co - workers .
tr	Nom	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Nom	I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
tr	Nom	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
tr	Nom	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Nom	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
tr	Nom	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Nom	I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
tr	Nom	I would recommend her highly !
tr	Nom	They won ' t have a second chance from me .
tr	Nom	That said , I hated this restaurant .
tr	Nom	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Nom	Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
tr	Nom	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Nom	I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
tr	Nom	"He told me "" no problem , we will match the offer or do better ."""
tr	Nom	I urge all St . Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
tr	Nom	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
tr	Nom	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
tr	Nom	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Nom	I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
tr	Nom	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Nom	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
tr	Nom	You have just lost mine .
tr	Nom	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Nom	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Nom	I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
tr	Nom	I did not have a good experience w / Dr . Ghassemlou .
tr	Nom	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Nom	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
tr	Nom	I learned more about this doing my own research afterward .
tr	Nom	I think he could ' ve done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
tr	Nom	Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
tr	Nom	It ' s pretty combative actually .
tr	Nom	you ' ll love it
tr	Nom	I have had my back fused in 2 places .
tr	Nom	I wish that I hadn ' t done this .
tr	Nom	With these fusions , chiropractric isn ' t as successful , but it still is very helpful .
tr	Nom	I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr . de Barros .
tr	Nom	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Nom	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can ' t see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
tr	Nom	I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
tr	Nom	I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color )!
tr	Nom	"I regularly request Kim ' s business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!!"""
tr	Nom	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
tr	Nom	I cannot recommend this salon enough !!!
tr	Nom	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Nom	If you cannot park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center ' s garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
tr	Nom	( it ' s by the door , on the hostess stand )
tr	Nom	I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
tr	Nom	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Nom	Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
tr	Nom	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
tr	Nom	I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
tr	Nom	I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband ' s funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
tr	Nom	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Nom	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
tr	Nom	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Nom	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Nom	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
tr	Nom	She recommended products but absolutely didn ' t pressure me to buy .
tr	Nom	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Nom	I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
tr	Nom	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
tr	Nom	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
tr	Nom	If you do not smoke , do not move here .
tr	Nom	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Nom	I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
tr	Nom	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Nom	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Nom	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Nom	He had a robe that was made back in the ' 60s .
tr	Nom	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Nom	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Nom	Stop by at least once or you ' ll go to heck !
tr	Nom	ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
tr	Nom	i ' ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
tr	Nom	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Nom	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Nom	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
tr	Nom	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Nom	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
tr	Nom	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
tr	Nom	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Nom	I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
tr	Nom	I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
tr	Nom	I wouldn ' t send my dogs there .
tr	Nom	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
tr	Nom	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren ' t paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
tr	Nom	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Nom	Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc . THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN ' T PAID .
tr	Nom	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
tr	Nom	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
tr	Nom	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Nom	She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
tr	Nom	I didn ' t even buy the bag there !
tr	Nom	Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don ' t have what you need .
tr	Nom	We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
tr	Nom	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Nom	We should have left then .
tr	Nom	We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
tr	Nom	We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
tr	Nom	Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long .
tr	Nom	I recommend La Hacienda
tr	Nom	Don ' t know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
tr	Nom	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Nom	i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
tr	Nom	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
tr	Nom	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Nom	from start to finish they were top notch .
tr	Nom	i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car .
tr	Nom	They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
tr	Nom	if you don ' t mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
tr	Nom	They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
tr	Nom	They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
tr	Nom	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Nom	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Nom	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F %# king Assh @%$ e !!!
tr	Nom	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
tr	Nom	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Nom	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Nom	I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need .
tr	Nom	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Nom	They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
tr	Nom	I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
tr	Nom	Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
tr	Nom	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
tr	Nom	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Nom	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
tr	Nom	I ' m glad I trusted my gut and didn ' t get sucked into doing business with them .
tr	Nom	Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right .
tr	Nom	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Nom	If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
tr	Nom	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Nom	( For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me !)
tr	Nom	Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
tr	Nom	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
tr	Nom	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
tr	Nom	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Nom	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Nom	And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
tr	Nom	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
tr	Nom	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Nom	If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
tr	Nom	Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ($ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
tr	Nom	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
tr	Nom	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Nom	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Nom	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Nom	I used to LOVE this place .
tr	Nom	But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
tr	Nom	I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them , they lost my car key .
tr	Nom	Lucky I had a spare with me !
tr	Nom	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
tr	Nom	( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you can ' t just go to WalMart .)
tr	Nom	Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
tr	Nom	However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
tr	Nom	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
tr	Nom	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
tr	Nom	We were told that we couldn ' t today because they were closing soon .
tr	Nom	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
tr	Nom	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Nom	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
tr	Nom	They refused .
tr	Nom	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Nom	You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
tr	Nom	You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate !
tr	Nom	Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont .
tr	Nom	Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
tr	Nom	Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
tr	Nom	You can fool people
tr	Nom	This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
tr	Nom	They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
tr	Nom	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Nom	Don ' t go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
tr	Nom	You won ' t even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
tr	Nom	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
tr	Nom	I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
tr	Nom	I guess you get what you pay for .
tr	Nom	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
tr	Nom	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Nom	Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
tr	Nom	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
tr	Nom	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
tr	Nom	"When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had "" reserved """
tr	Nom	I was thoroughly impressed !
tr	Nom	I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
tr	Nom	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren ' t the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
tr	Nom	The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company ' s were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
tr	Nom	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Nom	We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
tr	Nom	Best money I ' ve spent on remodeling ever .
tr	Nom	I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
tr	Nom	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
tr	Nom	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Nom	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Nom	The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
tr	Nom	( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
tr	Nom	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Nom	I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
tr	Nom	So I brought the car back the second day .
tr	Nom	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
tr	Nom	Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
tr	Nom	I walked away .
tr	Nom	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
tr	Nom	Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....
tr	Nom	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Nom	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Nom	We were also served salad and soda .
tr	Nom	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Nom	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Nom	I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
tr	Nom	I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
tr	Nom	I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
tr	Nom	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
tr	Nom	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
tr	Nom	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Nom	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
tr	Nom	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Nom	It wasn ' t completly impossible !!!!
tr	Nom	I am definitely going back
tr	Nom	After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner .
tr	Nom	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
tr	Nom	Run for the hills ... you ' ll be much better off !
tr	Nom	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Nom	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Nom	"I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "" This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton "" and the receptionist then hung up on me ."
tr	Nom	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Nom	We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
tr	Nom	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
tr	Nom	On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
tr	Nom	This is by far the BEST B & B that we have ever stayed at !
tr	Nom	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
tr	Nom	We could not have been more welcomed , more comfortable or more well fed .
tr	Nom	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Nom	We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
tr	Nom	Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
tr	Nom	I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
tr	Nom	Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre - screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
tr	Nom	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
tr	Nom	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
tr	Nom	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Nom	He did warm it up .
tr	Nom	He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
tr	Nom	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Nom	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Nom	I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
tr	Nom	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
tr	Nom	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Nom	( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...)
tr	Nom	Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we didn ' t mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
tr	Nom	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Nom	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Nom	We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
tr	Nom	Just Autos Thank you !
tr	Nom	They certainly know what they are doing .
tr	Nom	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Nom	So yes , I wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
tr	Nom	I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
tr	Nom	I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
tr	Nom	I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
tr	Nom	All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
tr	Nom	If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out !
tr	Nom	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
tr	Nom	I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!!!
tr	Nom	Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
tr	Nom	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife ' s work and towed it back to fix it .
tr	Nom	I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
tr	Nom	Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything , and smile while doing it .
tr	Nom	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
tr	Nom	However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
tr	Nom	I wonder if they were going down a hill !
tr	Nom	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
tr	Nom	I brought it back with 9000 miles .
tr	Nom	"They "" finished "" the work and told me the car was ready ."
tr	Nom	I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
tr	Nom	They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
tr	Nom	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
tr	Nom	I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever .
tr	Nom	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
tr	Nom	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Nom	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Nom	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Nom	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Nom	We signed our name in about 6 : 00pm .
tr	Nom	However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
tr	Nom	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Nom	I could not understand any his reasons .
tr	Nom	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
tr	Nom	"January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday ' s 2 PM class "" Beginning Yoga with Brittany ."""
tr	Nom	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Nom	We waited until 2 : 25 PM and then left .
tr	Nom	Well , not much I can say except I ' m very disappointed with this experience .
tr	Nom	As a yoga studio , I ' m sure you ' re all aware that all actions generate karma …
tr	Nom	I beg to differ .
tr	Nom	I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
tr	Nom	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Nom	I don ' t want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I don ' t want to take on something I can ' t handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
tr	Nom	They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
tr	Nom	We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
tr	Nom	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Nom	Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !
tr	Nom	They may look young but don ' t let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
tr	Nom	I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80 ' s , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960 ' s .
tr	Nom	So we didn ' t expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
tr	Nom	They just really know their stuff !
tr	Nom	I ' m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
tr	Nom	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
tr	Nom	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
tr	Nom	I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
tr	Nom	They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
tr	Nom	I never felt pain or discomfort .
tr	Nom	not only is this place too expensive for what it is , its horrible !
tr	Nom	In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin !), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
tr	Nom	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Nom	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Nom	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Nom	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
tr	Nom	I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here .
tr	Nom	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
tr	Nom	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Nom	You ' d think they would do a good job but they don ' t care unless they are getting paid full price .
tr	Nom	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
tr	Nom	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
tr	Nom	Then I got a bill for $ 483 . 00 .
tr	Nom	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
tr	Nom	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160 . 00 has come through .
tr	Nom	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Nom	How much could it possibly cost ?
tr	Nom	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
tr	Nom	I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
tr	Nom	We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
tr	Nom	We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
tr	Nom	They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
tr	Nom	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Nom	They did that with no problem .
tr	Nom	I also appreciate their honesty .
tr	Nom	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
tr	Nom	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
tr	Nom	They recently surprised me a larger order .
tr	Nom	I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
tr	Nom	Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
tr	Nom	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
tr	Nom	They have a customer for life in us !
tr	Nom	i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
tr	Nom	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
tr	Nom	Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
tr	Nom	Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
tr	Nom	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Nom	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
tr	Nom	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Nom	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
tr	Nom	Grimy work you guys do .
tr	Nom	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell ' s .
tr	Nom	I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
tr	Nom	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Nom	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Nom	I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
tr	Nom	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
tr	Nom	On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
tr	Nom	The craziest part is that they aren ' t even based locally at the city I ' m in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
tr	Nom	I ' ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
tr	Nom	Be warned - they ' ll ltake you for everything they can .
tr	Nom	It is also the largest .
tr	Nom	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
tr	Nom	When we complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any problems ), nothing happened !
tr	Nom	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Nom	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Nom	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Nom	To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
tr	Nom	I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
tr	Nom	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ).
tr	Nom	If I remember , students went to Dartmouth , U . Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others .
tr	Nom	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Nom	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Nom	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Nom	I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
tr	Nom	I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and can ' t stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I ' m in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
tr	Nom	They don ' t speak the best English but enough to get by .
tr	Nom	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Nom	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
tr	Nom	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
tr	Nom	Stop in and have a bite you won ' t regret it .
tr	Nom	I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
tr	Nom	I ' ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance )...
tr	Nom	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
tr	Nom	I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
tr	Nom	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
tr	Nom	Not what i expected !
tr	Nom	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Nom	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Nom	On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
tr	Nom	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
tr	Nom	They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
tr	Nom	They don ' t just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
tr	Nom	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Nom	Prices are reasonable , ( Kids meals are around 4 . 99 ) and Wednesday ' s they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
tr	Nom	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Nom	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Nom	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Nom	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Nom	And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well !)
tr	Nom	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Nom	I am a college student .
tr	Nom	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Nom	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
tr	Nom	I was amazed .
tr	Nom	I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
tr	Nom	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend ' s aunt recommended it .
tr	Nom	It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
tr	Nom	What I like most about Dr . Liau is that she is very caring .
tr	Nom	She talks to you at each appointment .
tr	Nom	I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
tr	Nom	I am SO GLAD to have found Dr . Liau .
tr	Nom	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
tr	Nom	There ' s plenty of parking , and I ' ve never had an issue with audience members who won ' t stop talking or answering their cellphones .
tr	Nom	But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
tr	Nom	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
tr	Nom	I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
tr	Nom	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
tr	Nom	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
tr	Nom	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Nom	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Nom	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Nom	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
tr	Nom	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
tr	Nom	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Nom	"We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , "" was I gotta have it !"""
tr	Nom	I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier .
tr	Nom	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
tr	Nom	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Nom	No problem , sounded like it ' s done every day .
tr	Nom	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Nom	I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
tr	Nom	Are they serious ?
tr	Nom	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Nom	Either these people don ' t know anything about what they are renting , or worse - they are bait and switching .
tr	Nom	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Nom	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Nom	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
tr	Nom	Didn ' t hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
tr	Nom	Thank you !
tr	Nom	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
tr	Nom	They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
tr	Nom	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Nom	lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
tr	Nom	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Nom	I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
tr	Nom	I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
tr	Nom	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
tr	Nom	Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
tr	Nom	I ' ma regular at the HH .
tr	Nom	I think they ' re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
tr	Nom	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Nom	They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it ' s not room temperature at best when you get it home .
tr	Nom	You just have to know what you ' re getting into when you go .
tr	Nom	Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ), and don ' t go if you have a limited amount of time .
tr	Nom	I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
tr	Nom	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
tr	Nom	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
tr	Nom	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical !
tr	Nom	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
tr	Nom	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Nom	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Nom	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Nom	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Nom	But I ' d go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
tr	Nom	It ' s just not worth it .
tr	Nom	I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
tr	Nom	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Nom	I called the front desk and got no answer .
tr	Nom	After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none , I decided to just pack up and leave .
tr	Nom	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Nom	Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
tr	Nom	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Nom	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
tr	Nom	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Nom	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Nom	Please do not go there if it ' s professional , friendly , diligent medical services you ' re looking for .
tr	Nom	When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
tr	Nom	That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
tr	Nom	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Nom	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Nom	So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
tr	Nom	One more thing , they don ' t take any credit cards or checks .
tr	Nom	You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
tr	Nom	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Nom	Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
tr	Nom	We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
tr	Nom	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Nom	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Nom	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
tr	Nom	Do not live here , you will regret it !
tr	Nom	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Nom	He was referred to me by a friend , who didn ' t have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
tr	Nom	I figure I would give this company a chance .
tr	Nom	However , after giving a required $ 500 . 00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
tr	Nom	We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
tr	Nom	He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
tr	Nom	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
tr	Nom	"When we walked in , the person behind desk said : "" oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something ."""
tr	Nom	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Nom	I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
tr	Nom	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Nom	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
tr	Nom	"When I inquired he rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out you ' ll get it back ."""
tr	Nom	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Nom	I also mentioned to the reception person .
tr	Nom	"He responded "" we have problem with ' people '""."
tr	Nom	I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
tr	Nom	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Nom	We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
tr	Nom	I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
tr	Nom	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
tr	Nom	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
tr	Nom	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn ' t budge .
tr	Nom	Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
tr	Nom	I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
tr	Nom	I emailed 4 times , never a response .
tr	Nom	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet ' s that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
tr	Nom	I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
tr	Nom	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
tr	Nom	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
tr	Nom	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
tr	Nom	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
tr	Nom	I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
tr	Nom	Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
tr	Nom	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Nom	I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
tr	Nom	They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
tr	Nom	So I ordered a slice .
tr	Nom	It tasted like I just flew back home .
tr	Nom	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Nom	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
tr	Nom	That being said , I don ' t know how their delivery service is .
tr	Nom	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
tr	Nom	We visited on 7 / 26 / 08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia ' s on Greenfield Ave .
tr	Nom	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Nom	I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
tr	Nom	Sorry for interrupting I guess .
tr	Nom	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Nom	I will not be visiting Mama Mia ' s again .
tr	Nom	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
tr	Nom	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Nom	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
tr	Nom	I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
tr	Nom	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
tr	Nom	I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
tr	Nom	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Nom	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Nom	its like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
tr	Nom	it seems like its healthier too , but its prolly not .
tr	Nom	also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it delivered **.
tr	Nom	that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting .
tr	Nom	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Nom	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Nom	anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
tr	Nom	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
tr	Nom	** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , I have had food delivered before .
tr	Nom	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Nom	Perhaps they don ' t deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
tr	Nom	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Nom	I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
tr	Nom	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Nom	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
tr	Nom	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
tr	Nom	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Nom	I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
tr	Nom	That ' s all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
tr	Nom	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
tr	Nom	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
tr	Nom	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Nom	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
tr	Nom	Thats how they were caught .
tr	Nom	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
tr	Nom	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
tr	Nom	It sucked having an SUV .
tr	Nom	If I found a spot , I couldnt fit in it .
tr	Nom	I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
tr	Nom	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Nom	Not only did they answer the phone at 4 : 50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
tr	Nom	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Nom	They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6 : 30 that evening .
tr	Nom	It ' s without a doubt , the best service experience I ' ve ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville ' s price for putting on the other rear tire .
tr	Nom	I hope I can return the favor in the future !
tr	Nom	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Nom	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Nom	I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get .
tr	Nom	I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call .
tr	Nom	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Nom	"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" you do not order what you do not know about "" and "" you don ' t know how pizza is made ""."
tr	Nom	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Nom	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
tr	Nom	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn ' t so well - done ( actually , burnt ).
tr	Nom	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
tr	Nom	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my * ss .
tr	Nom	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
tr	Nom	I mean , that ' s the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
tr	Nom	I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
tr	Nom	"If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are "" ok ,"" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
tr	Nom	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
tr	Nom	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
tr	Nom	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
tr	Nom	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Nom	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
tr	Nom	This chef knows what he is doing .
tr	Nom	I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
tr	Nom	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Nom	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Nom	I think that there pretty good .
tr	Nom	First of all , if you call for an appointment they won ' t tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
tr	Nom	"They also don ' t tell you that they ' re going to mail you an "" application "" to be admitted to be a patient ."
tr	Nom	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Nom	Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
tr	Nom	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
tr	Nom	But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
tr	Nom	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Nom	If you want miracles you ' ll have to go to 21st St .
tr	Nom	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Nom	They don ' t do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
tr	Nom	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
tr	Nom	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
tr	Nom	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
tr	Nom	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
tr	Nom	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
tr	Nom	I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
tr	Nom	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
tr	Nom	Update : I had to add to my review .
tr	Nom	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
tr	Nom	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
tr	Nom	"Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
tr	Nom	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Nom	We were greeted again and sat promptly .
tr	Nom	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
tr	Nom	I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
tr	Nom	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
tr	Nom	I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
tr	Nom	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Nom	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Nom	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Nom	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
tr	Nom	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Nom	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
tr	Nom	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car .
tr	Nom	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
tr	Nom	He is my mechanic going forward !
tr	Nom	We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
tr	Nom	We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
tr	Nom	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Nom	2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
tr	Nom	How has it gone so far ?
tr	Nom	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Nom	We are absolutely confident that Stuart ' s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
tr	Nom	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Nom	I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
tr	Nom	The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that ' s not why I ' m writing my review .
tr	Nom	Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
tr	Nom	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Nom	Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and didn ' t charge me a dime .
tr	Nom	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Nom	I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone ' s business !
tr	Nom	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
tr	Nom	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Nom	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Nom	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
tr	Nom	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Nom	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
tr	Nom	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Nom	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Nom	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Nom	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Nom	After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
tr	Nom	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Nom	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which isn ' t true .
tr	Nom	I mean , I don ' t care if he doesn ' t know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there ' s no way I ' m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
tr	Nom	The Worst Chinese I ' ve Ever Had
tr	Nom	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Nom	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone elses .
tr	Nom	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
tr	Nom	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
tr	Nom	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Nom	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order .
tr	Nom	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
tr	Nom	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Nom	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
tr	Nom	I will NEVER go here again .
tr	Nom	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Nom	One of the worst experiences I ' ve ever had with a auto repair shop .
tr	Nom	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
tr	Nom	We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
tr	Nom	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Nom	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Nom	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Nom	He stood there and told us how he wasn ' t at fault .
tr	Nom	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Nom	And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
tr	Nom	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Nom	I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
tr	Nom	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Nom	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
tr	Nom	I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
tr	Nom	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
tr	Nom	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Nom	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Nom	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Nom	I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
tr	Nom	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Nom	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
tr	Nom	I explained I did not get what I paid for .
tr	Nom	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Nom	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Nom	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
tr	Nom	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner ' s own unprofessionalism .
tr	Nom	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Nom	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Nom	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
tr	Nom	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
tr	Nom	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Nom	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club ' s actual OWNER ?!
tr	Nom	I was appalled .
tr	Nom	I will never recommend this gym to any woman .
tr	Nom	I feel obligated to share this story .
tr	Nom	Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
tr	Nom	I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don ' t show up , they ' ll charge you .
tr	Nom	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
tr	Nom	"After he already put product on my hair he said "" I should warn you , I ' m expensive ."""
tr	Nom	What was I supposed to do , say I can ' t afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair .
tr	Nom	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Nom	Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
tr	Nom	I cried the entire way home .
tr	Nom	"He then "" fixed "" it for free but it still looked like crap ."
tr	Nom	I will never go back .
tr	Nom	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
tr	Nom	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
tr	Nom	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Nom	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Nom	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
tr	Nom	However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
tr	Nom	I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
tr	Nom	I wasn ' t going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
tr	Nom	However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6 , 000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
tr	Nom	Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
tr	Nom	He said yes .
tr	Nom	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Nom	I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
tr	Nom	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
tr	Nom	Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
tr	Nom	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
tr	Nom	( They even got me a couch pretty quickly .)
tr	Nom	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Nom	The other person working at the store didn ' t know that I still had this table coming .
tr	Nom	I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
tr	Nom	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
tr	Nom	I waited .
tr	Nom	He never once contacted us .
tr	Nom	I ' ve had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
tr	Nom	He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and didn ' t seem terribly apologetic .
tr	Nom	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Nom	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Nom	If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would .
tr	Nom	On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
tr	Nom	I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
tr	Nom	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Nom	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Nom	How do you lose a drawer .
tr	Nom	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
tr	Nom	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone ' s warehouse .
tr	Nom	Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service .
tr	Nom	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Nom	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
tr	Nom	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Nom	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
tr	Nom	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Nom	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn ' t feel comfortable driving an SUV .
tr	Nom	"Gerry pleasantly said "" since I am already here why don ' t we give it shot ."
tr	Nom	I trust you and believe that you ' ll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
tr	Nom	"Don ' t worry , I ' ll take care of you !"""
tr	Nom	Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
tr	Nom	Gerry , I can ' t thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear .
tr	Nom	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Nom	But we don ' t just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
tr	Nom	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
tr	Nom	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Nom	We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back .
tr	Nom	They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
tr	Nom	We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
tr	Nom	And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
tr	Nom	They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
tr	Nom	You don ' t have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
tr	Nom	and you will go back for more !!!
tr	Nom	"PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "" all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and I will tell you that I don ' t know these people except from eating at their restaurant ."
tr	Nom	We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
tr	Nom	Because we think IT ' S THE BEST !!!
tr	Nom	and we don ' t know them except for eating there .
tr	Nom	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Nom	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
tr	Nom	I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
tr	Nom	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Nom	"He later said that by 2 months he "" meant at least two months ""."
tr	Nom	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
tr	Nom	He also never even said he was sorry .
tr	Nom	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
tr	Nom	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Nom	I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
tr	Nom	I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
tr	Nom	He said it sarcastically .
tr	Nom	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
tr	Nom	What you can learn from the below ' bad experience '.
tr	Nom	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
tr	Nom	I ' d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they don ' t just take every dog coming in .
tr	Nom	I ' ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
tr	Nom	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Nom	But I ' ve done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I don ' t work here ), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
tr	Nom	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Nom	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Nom	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Nom	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Nom	No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so isn ' t it reasonable to think they might know what they ' re doing ?
tr	Nom	I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
tr	Nom	So I say : I ' m at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
tr	Nom	They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
tr	Nom	I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I ' m at the Radison - Warwick .
tr	Nom	And he says : You ' re at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
tr	Nom	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Nom	I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
tr	Nom	He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I ' m in PHILLY .
tr	Nom	I SAY LISTEN : I ' m at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
tr	Nom	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Nom	OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
tr	Nom	he says : Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
tr	Nom	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Nom	YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
tr	Nom	Yes , I say .
tr	Nom	17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
tr	Nom	You ' re at 7th .
tr	Nom	I am just south of Walnut .
tr	Nom	She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
tr	Nom	YES , I am west of broad .
tr	Nom	Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
tr	Nom	Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we don ' t go past broad ?
tr	Nom	Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno ' s .
tr	Nom	They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
tr	Nom	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
tr	Nom	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
tr	Nom	We heard nothing .
tr	Nom	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Nom	I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
tr	Nom	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Nom	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Nom	I WAS calling about one board !!
tr	Nom	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Nom	So I figure if they don ' t want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I ' ll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
tr	Nom	YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
tr	Nom	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
tr	Nom	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Nom	Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
tr	Nom	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Nom	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Nom	They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
tr	Nom	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
tr	Nom	The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
tr	Nom	In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
tr	Nom	Then she was gone .
tr	Nom	We returned after 3PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
tr	Nom	Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
tr	Nom	If they think you ' ve taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1 . 50 per can .
tr	Nom	They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
tr	Nom	# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
tr	Nom	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Nom	If you go later , it ' s all cleaned up .
tr	Nom	( By whom , I don ' t know .
tr	Nom	I never saw anyone there .
tr	Nom	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
tr	Nom	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
tr	Nom	I ' d go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I wouldn ' t pay their rack rate .
tr	Nom	It ' s an entirely up and down experience , however .
tr	Nom	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).
tr	Nom	Though they are mostly excellent , you generally don ' t get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
tr	Nom	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Nom	Dessert was ... hmmm , that ' s interesting , I don ' t even remember dessert .
tr	Nom	I guess that tells you a lot .
tr	Nom	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Nom	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you ' ve never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
tr	Nom	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Nom	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Nom	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
tr	Nom	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
tr	Nom	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Nom	So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
tr	Nom	"They said they were "" unable to tell me until they ordered my dress ""."
tr	Nom	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Nom	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Nom	I ' m no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
tr	Nom	Whatever type of operation they are running , I ' m not interested and if you ' re smart , you won ' t be either .
tr	Nom	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Nom	"I didn ' t think so but you could be right ."""
tr	Nom	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
tr	Nom	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
tr	Nom	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn ' t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
tr	Nom	After happily visiting Sear ' s Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
tr	Nom	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
tr	Nom	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Nom	Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
tr	Nom	Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
tr	Nom	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn ' t possible .
tr	Nom	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Nom	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Nom	I would not have gone back , but I couldn ' t find the particular tire they ' d used in stock anywhere else .
tr	Nom	Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
tr	Nom	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Nom	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Nom	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Nom	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Nom	So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
tr	Nom	They promised it ' d be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
tr	Nom	Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
tr	Nom	"A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that "" I "" left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car )."
tr	Nom	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Nom	Of course I couldn ' t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ).
tr	Nom	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Nom	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Nom	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
tr	Nom	The employees at this Sear ' s are completely apathetic and there didn ' t seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
tr	Nom	I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ).
tr	Gen	On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home .
tr	Gen	In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district .
tr	Gen	His mother was also killed in the attack .
tr	Gen	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Gen	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Gen	But in my view it is highly significant .
tr	Gen	The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas .
tr	Gen	Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran .
tr	Gen	A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died .
tr	Gen	Baghdadis don ' t venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more , you never know where you might get stuck .
tr	Gen	My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non - stop .
tr	Gen	Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions .
tr	Gen	Even a little time spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc . can add years to their lives .
tr	Gen	Take care , my friend , Linda
tr	Gen	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Gen	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Gen	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Gen	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Gen	Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .
tr	Gen	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Gen	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Gen	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .
tr	Gen	The Americans have to put away their free - market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households .
tr	Gen	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Gen	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Gen	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Gen	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Gen	Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
tr	Gen	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel ' s security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Gen	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Gen	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Gen	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country ' s petroleum reserves .
tr	Gen	Israel ' s security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
tr	Gen	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Gen	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Gen	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Gen	""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement ,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview ."
tr	Gen	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Gen	The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession .
tr	Gen	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Gen	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Gen	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U . S . State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .
tr	Gen	"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
tr	Gen	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Gen	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
tr	Gen	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Gen	That his daddy got him in ?
tr	Gen	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Gen	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Gen	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Gen	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Gen	His superior officers said OK .
tr	Gen	Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .
tr	Gen	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Gen	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Gen	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Gen	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Gen	And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well .
tr	Gen	His column appears in The Hill each week .
tr	Gen	Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
tr	Gen	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Gen	"Chalabi describing Sha ' lan as a "" Ba ' athist "" and a "" former double agent for Saddam and the CIA "", while Sha ' lan dismisses Chalabi as a "" thief "" and an "" Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran ""."
tr	Gen	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Gen	Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
tr	Gen	Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April , 2004 , with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques .
tr	Gen	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Gen	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Gen	The Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid - nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe .
tr	Gen	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Gen	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Gen	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Gen	Posada ' s crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who don ' t know their history .
tr	Gen	And to those who don ' t even know their crimes , not even that .
tr	Gen	An embarrassment to the US still , just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami , gloating in his freedom .
tr	Gen	"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Gen	So his name will remain unspoken .
tr	Gen	Please check out my who let the dog out blog .
tr	Gen	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Gen	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"

tr	Gen	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Gen	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Gen	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Gen	A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
tr	Gen	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Gen	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Gen	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Gen	“ The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all .
tr	Gen	All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan .
tr	Gen	An Afghan official at the meeting added , ‘’ The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda .’’
tr	Gen	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Gen	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Gen	US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .
tr	Gen	Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .
tr	Gen	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Gen	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Gen	With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’ s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced .
tr	Gen	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Gen	What was Bush doing with his youth ?
tr	Gen	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Gen	"( Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet , "" Let heads roll !"")"
tr	Gen	His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
tr	Gen	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Gen	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Gen	That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father ' s urging . . .
tr	Gen	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George certainly didn ' t seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there .
tr	Gen	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Gen	GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr . Bush enjoyed his freedom .
tr	Gen	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Gen	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Gen	Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger .
tr	Gen	Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .
tr	Gen	An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
tr	Gen	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Gen	Of course law enforcement has dragged it ' s feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
tr	Gen	One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father ' s own brother .
tr	Gen	Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
tr	Gen	Which may explain the pattern to their stories : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .
tr	Gen	One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don ' t know what they are , don ' t care , or know perfectly well .
tr	Gen	"Praise be : Given the void in responsible behavior among governments , police , educational establishments and religions , the task of guiding our youth down the path of righteousness has fallen to ... Satan """
tr	Gen	"What about Manson ' s tees bearing the message , "" Kill your parents ""."
tr	Gen	( not church morality , no that is phoney , love thy neighbor ... hell no , kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????)
tr	Gen	One man ' s relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post - war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year .
tr	Gen	The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together .
tr	Gen	But their parents refused to accept this .
tr	Gen	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Gen	During this search , Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son ' s disappearance .
tr	Gen	Talk about a beat - your - head - against - the - wall moment !
tr	Gen	So why even credit their claims ?
tr	Gen	This only serves their purposes .
tr	Gen	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Gen	so , enemy , what ' s your point ?
tr	Gen	My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
tr	Gen	Just give your email and / or phone number to these guys and they ' ll track down your family .
tr	Gen	But succintly making point after succint point , the text of the letter stands on its own merit , regardless .
tr	Gen	America , your condition is dire , dark and deep .
tr	Gen	"Of the metal music farce , Ministry has definately made in - road into ' Loose Change ""-"" Alex Jones "" territory with their new record , Rio Grande Blood ."
tr	Gen	In my opinion , people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems .
tr	Gen	My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion .
tr	Gen	The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns , and then 200 , 000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus .
tr	Gen	Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e - mail .
tr	Gen	My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
tr	Gen	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Gen	Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
tr	Gen	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Gen	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Gen	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Gen	Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
tr	Gen	Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
tr	Gen	The U . S . and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
tr	Gen	A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
tr	Gen	In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
tr	Gen	But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
tr	Gen	But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
tr	Gen	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid - day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
tr	Gen	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
tr	Gen	The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
tr	Gen	Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
tr	Gen	"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
tr	Gen	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Gen	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Gen	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Gen	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Gen	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Gen	"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."""
tr	Gen	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Gen	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Gen	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Gen	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Gen	"Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable , has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "" anthrax for Jew sympathizer only ."""
tr	Gen	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Gen	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Gen	Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda .
tr	Gen	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Gen	The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax .
tr	Gen	Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
tr	Gen	Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the fugitives .
tr	Gen	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Gen	Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March .
tr	Gen	Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad .
tr	Gen	"His nickname is "" Jafar the Pilot ."""
tr	Gen	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Gen	According to at least some reports , Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad .
tr	Gen	That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals .
tr	Gen	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Gen	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Gen	Along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden .
tr	Gen	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Gen	"Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "" The 19 Martyrs ."""
tr	Gen	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Gen	By Greendale School , the anthrax perp was being cute , just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
tr	Gen	Whatever your political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve our support .
tr	Gen	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .

tr	Gen	The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel .

tr	Gen	Almost done with your drafts .
tr	Gen	Sam , please confirm , Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Gen	Thanks Bill - appreciate your help !
tr	Gen	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
tr	Gen	In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .
tr	Gen	Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Gen	Sam , please confirm , Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .

tr	Gen	This is the background to my conversation with Shanna .
tr	Gen	Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work .

tr	Gen	My extension is 35620 .
tr	Gen	As a result of our luncheon with the confirm desk yesterday , could someone develop a comprehensive list identifying all omnibus attachments ?
tr	Gen	How ' s your family ?
tr	Gen	( if .....) ( iii ) definitive agreements acceptable to Party A in its sole discretion regarding the debt and all other aspects of [ the project to be owned by Party B ], including but not limited to the senior debt facility , commitments and all project documents , have been fully negotiated and executed and the [ project ] has been brought to financial close .
tr	Gen	This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG & E ' s headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
tr	Gen	Our time is likely to be limited to 5 - 10 minutes .

tr	Gen	"His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "" refunds ."""
tr	Gen	On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .
tr	Gen	On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
tr	Gen	Harry also had a good comment --- don ' t specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
tr	Gen	This is a request for your interview participation .
tr	Gen	Due to business reasons , previously scheduled interviewers from the Penn team have had to cancel their participation .
tr	Gen	Please don ' t mention my NY trip to anyone .
tr	Gen	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95 , 000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
tr	Gen	Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?
tr	Gen	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Gen	in our case , they are only hedging .
tr	Gen	the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back .
tr	Gen	Attached is my resume .
tr	Gen	Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions .
tr	Gen	Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date .
tr	Gen	Thanks in advance for your cooperation .
tr	Gen	Where does our 50 % ( the 1 . 65 million dollars ) show up ?
tr	Gen	Marianne : The following are my comments :
tr	Gen	Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
tr	Gen	1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer ' s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T & D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer ' s utility .
tr	Gen	Thanks again for your help with this project ,
tr	Gen	"P . S . Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "" hiatus "" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7 / 16 ."
tr	Gen	Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of the language that makes the LC transferable .
tr	Gen	In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form , I think you should add a forward contract rep .
tr	Gen	His number is 860 - 665 - 2368 and e - mail address is leporjj @ selectenergy . com .
tr	Gen	Thanks so much for your help on this .
tr	Gen	Our credit person doesn ' t understand why the transferability language needs to be eliminated .
tr	Gen	Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
tr	Gen	Our system did not show any other chnages .
tr	Gen	Our in - service date is May 1 .
tr	Gen	The I / C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100 % of design ).

tr	Gen	My concern is that between now and then Dunn , the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief , which could be detrimental to generators / marketers ' claims .
tr	Gen	Thanks for the info - a few people from our shop will be in attendance ./
tr	Gen	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Gen	The generators got their way .
tr	Gen	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they couldn ' t make a profit even under these constraints .
tr	Gen	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Gen	""" In our view , we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation ."
tr	Gen	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Gen	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .
tr	Gen	Accordingly , the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP ( the only one and therefore the one they have to choose ) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract .
tr	Gen	Thanks for you cooperation .
tr	Gen	Thanks for your help this morning .
tr	Gen	Address this to Robin Gibbs for my signature .
tr	Gen	Per my voice mail , here is the letter .
tr	Gen	Hope your pre Chanukah planning is going well .
tr	Gen	Now that Michelle is in your fold , do you want to reconsider her being the contact person with AAA on this ?
tr	Gen	The real purpose of my call , however , is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational statements of the Protocol .
tr	Gen	Initially our design group , along with perhaps one of our technology consultants , would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half a day .?
tr	Gen	People like this will never have my sympathy , nor do they deserve my sympathy .
tr	Gen	"Stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to "" get a break "" ."
tr	Gen	One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one , that there is no separation between you and I , we are all together in this thing called life , we human beings , the birds and the tress , the rocks and the sky , all of it .
tr	Gen	Our strength is in our unity and harmony .

tr	Gen	The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
tr	Gen	""" Their screams changed ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Gen	Again Dr . Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
tr	Gen	Dr . Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
tr	Gen	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr . Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr . Fortier said .

tr	Gen	Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from ' The Lotus Position ' or ' Padmasana '.
tr	Gen	Founder Paul Galvin came up with this name when his company started manufacturing radios for cars .

tr	Gen	My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
tr	Gen	In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my father , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran .
tr	Gen	This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U . S .- British subsidiary .
tr	Gen	My father re - secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U . S . dollars ($ 61 , 000 , 000 , 000 ).
tr	Gen	But my father ' s former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
tr	Gen	My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
tr	Gen	Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($ 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 ), both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
tr	Gen	Without the funds from our 1991 partners , we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq .
tr	Gen	That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance .
tr	Gen	Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice - president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
tr	Gen	The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary .
tr	Gen	My family and our colleagues will be forever grateful .

tr	Gen	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Gen	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Gen	Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .
tr	Gen	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Gen	Increasingly , analysts are saying that China ' s efforts have gone beyond what is safe or even in its own interests .
tr	Gen	Eurasia Group , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price .
tr	Gen	""" If China ' s economy falters , which , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity prices will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets that produce them ,"" Jason Kindopp , Eurasia ' s lead China analyst , said ."
tr	Gen	China ' s wider aggression to secure oil and gas was the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade .
tr	Gen	Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
tr	Gen	Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth .

tr	Gen	With each breath , feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter , and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness .
tr	Gen	Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ), the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
tr	Gen	Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
tr	Gen	Your muscles are loose and limp .
tr	Gen	Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
tr	Gen	With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
tr	Gen	Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .
tr	Gen	Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
tr	Gen	A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
tr	Gen	Let your mind and body be totally at peace .
tr	Gen	Open your eyes .
tr	Gen	Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
tr	Gen	"Its meaning is "" Infinite happiness is everywhere ""."
tr	Gen	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Gen	The important point is to develop some psycho - spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
tr	Gen	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .

tr	Gen	"This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "" secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity .”"
tr	Gen	"The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “ inalienable rights ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness ."""
tr	Gen	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Gen	The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law .
tr	Gen	My Fellow Americans :
tr	Gen	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Gen	His co - workers love him .
tr	Gen	His fellow judges love him .
tr	Gen	His family loves him .
tr	Gen	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Gen	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Gen	In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
tr	Gen	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Gen	China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
tr	Gen	China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China ' s Gansu Province .
tr	Gen	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Gen	Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .

tr	Gen	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Gen	Their sheep could graze , their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard .
tr	Gen	Over time , the wolf ' s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
tr	Gen	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Gen	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Gen	Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
tr	Gen	Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
tr	Gen	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Gen	"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic ."""
tr	Gen	Nina Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61 - year uninterrupted phenological records .

tr	Gen	Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier .

tr	Gen	Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .
tr	Gen	Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat .
tr	Gen	According to Parmesan ' s earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .

tr	Gen	"The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality , he grew the beard that we see in the "" Let it Be "" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film , doing every effort he could to be seen as a man ...."
tr	Gen	This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
tr	Gen	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."

tr	Gen	""" The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year , according to German media reports , reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media ,"" reported UPI on December 30th ."
tr	Gen	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
tr	Gen	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Gen	"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."

tr	Gen	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .

tr	Gen	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .
tr	Gen	More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .
tr	Gen	By dumping some portion of their reserves , these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U . S . interest rates skyrocketing .
tr	Gen	""" The hardest blow on Americans ,"" concluded Roberts , "" will fall when China does revalue its currency ."
tr	Gen	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .
tr	Gen	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .
tr	Gen	Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .

tr	Gen	that help alot with your thigh muscles ( bareback though )
tr	Gen	maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i ' ve thought about getting one .
tr	Gen	with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it ' s forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
tr	Gen	What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis ?

tr	Gen	Is there a future for our nation ' s youth ?
tr	Gen	Your answer doesn ' t do anything but remind me that I ' m going to be $ 25 , 000 in debt by the time I ' m 22 .

tr	Gen	In my opinion , far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees .
tr	Gen	My 2c . ....
tr	Gen	why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
tr	Gen	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Gen	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Gen	Its body will be dull looking , too .
tr	Gen	In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
tr	Gen	For example , some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall .
tr	Gen	are my two cats fighting or playing ?
tr	Gen	giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
tr	Gen	right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
tr	Gen	this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
tr	Gen	as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
tr	Gen	your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
tr	Gen	putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .

tr	Gen	In the end Nixon kept his promise for “… peace with honor ….”
tr	Gen	"My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the "" sun rays "" he needs ?"
tr	Gen	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Gen	Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .

tr	Gen	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
tr	Gen	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
tr	Gen	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Gen	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Gen	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe don ' t jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don ' t want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
tr	Gen	Call dominos in your town .
tr	Gen	"Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year !""."

tr	Gen	The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
tr	Gen	And my -- no , I still don ' t remember what I had .

tr	Gen	MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store .
tr	Gen	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .

tr	Gen	The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
va	Nom	He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they didn ' t .
va	Nom	Nervous people make mistakes , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks .
va	Nom	In Fallujah , hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride .
va	Nom	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Nom	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Nom	Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company ' s story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who haven ' t heard it .
va	Nom	"They work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company who ' s stated goals include "" Don ' t be evil ,"" they imagine a company who ' s eventually history will be "" Don ' t be profitable ."""
va	Nom	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Nom	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Nom	We ' ve moved on .
va	Nom	We ' ve grown up .
va	Nom	What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it ' s always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
va	Nom	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
va	Nom	It ' s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
va	Nom	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
va	Nom	Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
va	Nom	""" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in ,"" Masoud Shojai , head of the country ' s "" Iran Cartoon "" association and the fair organizer , said ."
va	Nom	""" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison ,"" he added ."
va	Nom	""" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ?"""
va	Nom	He added that around 1 , 100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
va	Nom	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Nom	When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
va	Nom	US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance .
va	Nom	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Nom	At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
va	Nom	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’ s ever seen .
va	Nom	The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
va	Nom	It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
va	Nom	It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
va	Nom	I ran across this item on the Internet .
va	Nom	Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U . S . citizen .
va	Nom	Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ).
va	Nom	Yet we didn ' t charge them for the evacuation .
va	Nom	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U . S . citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
va	Nom	And what do we get for this effort ?
va	Nom	The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts .
va	Nom	The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
va	Nom	""" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home ,"" Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit ."
va	Nom	""" We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us ."
va	Nom	"I was on my way to my wedding fearing death , basically ."""
va	Nom	"Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin ' s "" White House Briefing "" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ):"
va	Nom	This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn ' t anticipated .
va	Nom	After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
va	Nom	""" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that ."
va	Nom	I ' m just speculating now .
va	Nom	I really haven ' t thought about writing a book .
va	Nom	It ' s a Western scene by a guy named W . H . S . Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Nom	It ' s on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O ' Neill in Midland , Texas .
va	Nom	He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
va	Nom	Four months later , we were married .
va	Nom	So he ' s got a -- I ' m a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
va	Nom	""" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer ."
va	Nom	Laura and I are Methodists .
va	Nom	I have .
va	Nom	I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can .
va	Nom	""" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep ."
va	Nom	And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
va	Nom	"And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "" A Charge to Keep ""?"
va	Nom	It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
va	Nom	They have acquired Urchin , Zipdash , Applied Semantics , Picasa , Blogger , and satellite imaging company Keyhole , so why not Firefox ?
va	Nom	I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
va	Nom	He announced this in January :
va	Nom	I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
va	Nom	He also announced this in January :
va	Nom	"I just want to extend a big "" Welcome !"" to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week ."
va	Nom	Following on the heels of Ben ' s annoucement yesterday , I thought I ' d post that I have joined Google as well .
va	Nom	Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
va	Nom	I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
va	Nom	Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it ' s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
va	Nom	If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
va	Nom	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Nom	They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
va	Nom	I ' m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non - Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they ' re ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
va	Nom	It ' s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
va	Nom	Malach , What you say makes sense .
va	Nom	It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis - matches .
va	Nom	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
va	Nom	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
va	Nom	They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick .
va	Nom	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
va	Nom	I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
va	Nom	But they haven ' t been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
va	Nom	There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don ' t want to fall into it .
va	Nom	But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
va	Nom	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
va	Nom	"' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group ' s "" striking arm "" in Iraq ."
va	Nom	""" I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas ,"" Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah ."
va	Nom	He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
va	Nom	I ' m not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
va	Nom	Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday ?
va	Nom	i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out .
va	Nom	I definitely could use a drink , actually a couple would probably do better .
va	Nom	Bryan , you ' re in , right ?
va	Nom	I was thinking Kenneally ' s at around 5 .
va	Nom	you don ' t know what that means ?
va	Nom	where did you grow up ?
va	Nom	should I be embarrassed that I haven ' t the slightest idea what that means ?
va	Nom	i am going out tonight to get wasted if anyone is interested .
va	Nom	they haven ' t heard from you in a while .
va	Nom	In fact Peder and I were remarking on how agreeable they all are as the sucked on our balls last night .
va	Nom	i have to go to butt - fucking mississippi .
va	Nom	i am not looking foward to that but don ' t tell val .
va	Nom	the following weekend i will be ready to rock .
va	Nom	i think they are all bark and no bite .
va	Nom	i think they could get their asses kicked by cats .
va	Nom	they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk .
va	Nom	you should get a cockerspaniel .
va	Nom	no , i am not kidding and no i don ' t want it b / c of the taco bell dog .
va	Nom	i want it b / c it is really small and cute .
va	Nom	i knew someone in college who had one and i loved it .
va	Nom	why do you think they are mean ?
va	Nom	are you kidding ?
va	Nom	why would you want a chihuahua ?
va	Nom	do you think they are cool b / c of the taco bell dog ?
va	Nom	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Nom	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Nom	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .
va	Nom	you aren ' t going in for the wedding until sunday now ?

va	Nom	He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid .
va	Nom	He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure .

va	Nom	She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re - wording of Section 7 .
va	Nom	I revised the language based on our discussions and added the language concerning interest which we had both previously approved .

va	Nom	You have always been on the move seeking affectionate , satisfying and harmonious relationships .
va	Nom	"It has often been said that "" True love is just around the corner ""... and maybe ... if you haven ' t found it as yet - you possibly soon will ."
va	Nom	In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without .
va	Nom	You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem .
va	Nom	You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment ..
va	Nom	Whatever you strive to do , something always seems to be holding you back .
va	Nom	You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life , in a relationship , is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can , together , develop a foundation of trust based on understanding .
va	Nom	You are your own person ... and you demand freedom of thought ... to follow your own convictions .
va	Nom	"You have no interest in "" two - timing "" and all you seek is sincerity and "" straight - dealing ""."
va	Nom	You wish to be left in peace ... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ...

va	Nom	Is it possible that you or somebody else in the HR department mark the vacation time ?
va	Nom	I would really appreciate that .
va	Nom	I have attached a revised copy of the GISB Agreement and Special Provisions for your review and consideration .
va	Nom	I anticipate completing the review of the Master Agreement form and submitting comments to you by Monday .
va	Nom	In addition , I received feedback from our Gas Desk that the access to the Gas segment of Enron On - Line was cut off to CPS --- do you know who would handle this at Enron that we can speak to ?
va	Nom	I look forward to your feedback on the GISB .
va	Nom	PS - Were you having phone system problems this morning ?
va	Nom	I have sent your question re on line trading to that area .
va	Nom	They will contact you .
va	Nom	I am in the process of reviewing your special provisions .
va	Nom	Jackie Taylor - she is located at Court House Concessionaire and under her name in the directory .
va	Nom	"Please clarify "" all "" do you intend 10MM for ENA as well ?"
va	Nom	The only agreement I can find is a Master Sale Spot w / City of Springfield .
va	Nom	As you see it was CES acquired by ENA in asset purchase .
va	Nom	"I do not find the term "" Alternate Transporter Imbalance "" in our agreement .."
va	Nom	Could this be what your referencing ?
va	Nom	Go ahead and forward to Brant if you are ready .
va	Nom	You are correct , I will make the appropriate changes and give you another review before sending execution papers .
va	Nom	As you can see there are several blanks concerning administrative information for ENA Upstream .
va	Nom	I was able to secure a Duns # and Fed Tax ID however , I am lacking Fax and bank account numbers .
va	Nom	Do you have this information ?
va	Nom	They are taking delivery in the U . S .
va	Nom	Can you send me the data you used : I shall take a look at it .
va	Nom	"I used to e - mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article "" The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives "" and he had mailed me the copy ."
va	Nom	"I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper "" Making the most of mean reversion "" to estimate the mean reversion speed ."
va	Nom	I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 giving about 44 , 000 price observations .
va	Nom	Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign .
va	Nom	I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same .
va	Nom	It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter .
va	Nom	This is the best solution given all the uncertainties we face .
va	Nom	Right now , we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year .
va	Nom	Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer .
va	Nom	What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo ' s resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer .
va	Nom	When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group .
va	Nom	I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday .
va	Nom	One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship .
va	Nom	He came across as a very bright person , very personable .
va	Nom	I can take him as a summer intern .
va	Nom	How are you doing ?
va	Nom	I hope you have a good flight back to home .
va	Nom	It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector .
va	Nom	I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk .
va	Nom	However , you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again .
va	Nom	Those attachments are what I was asked .
va	Nom	Again , it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school .
va	Nom	I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day .
va	Nom	I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology .
va	Nom	Thank you ,
va	Nom	As such , we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent .
va	Nom	We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9 / 30 / 01 statement ( 6 , 606 shares plus cash for fractional shares ).
va	Nom	If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check , we can distribute gross shares .
va	Nom	As you know , we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt .
va	Nom	As such , we have a CPA , Larry Lewis , working with us to audit and set up transition files .
va	Nom	He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments .
va	Nom	If you would like , we can set up a conference call with you , myself , and Larry to go over the payment methodology .
va	Nom	It is clear that the payment will be made in shares .
va	Nom	However , I still don ' t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares .
va	Nom	Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account .
va	Nom	I am expecting to pay something in the $ 3 , to $ 5 , 000 range .
va	Nom	I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done .
va	Nom	It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding .
va	Nom	If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify .
va	Nom	If the negotiations stall , it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities .
va	Nom	I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office .
va	Nom	The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold .
va	Nom	I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices .
va	Nom	This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting .
va	Nom	We should be able to work with this .
va	Nom	Hope you enjoy the posts and feel free to jump in anywhere .
va	Nom	Hope to see you soon !
va	Nom	All you have to do is sign up for one free offer ( such as efax ) and then cancel within the offer time frame .

va	Nom	Now I have wife and son .
va	Nom	So , I ' m Men and love to wear women ' s lingerie :-).
va	Nom	There nothing wrong with men dressing in lingerie , when I get home at night the first thing I do is change into a nice silky nightgown or nightie , love the feel .
va	Nom	It is easy to get discount airfare for them since they travel very frequently .
va	Nom	Some of the corporate also get cheap air tickets because they tie up with some of the airlines for a certain period based on the discount and services they get from the airlines .
va	Nom	During this period , they offer cheap air tickets to their country on certain flights .
va	Nom	If you can check with the other airlines during this period , you may get excellent discount airfare , which may even surprise you .
va	Nom	Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminated between ADHD , LD , and control subjects .
va	Nom	I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet .
va	Nom	It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
va	Nom	I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it .
va	Nom	I think a test like this one is much needed .
va	Nom	Perhaps you are willing to recommend this site and , if you have a website , place a link on your website .

va	Nom	Currently , I am writing a book on natural supplements to aid weight loss , with Harry Preuss , MD , a Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University ; it is scheduled for publication by Broadway ( Random House ) in January 2007 .
va	Nom	I am seeking anecdotes ( first name , last initial ) from dieters who successfully used a natural supplement to assist their weight loss ; the therapeutic agents under discussion include HCA , MCT , green or oolong tea extract , CLA , chromium , starch - blockers , chitosan , 5 - HTP , hoodia and caralluma , HMB , and BCAA .

va	Nom	Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .
va	Nom	"As such , it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement ,"" said James Perry , GNOFHAC Executive Director"
va	Nom	After brushing the Florida Keys islands on Tuesday , Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico .
va	Nom	Valero said it was reducing rates at its 243 , 000 bpd Texas City refinery and its 85 , 000 bpd Houston refinery .
va	Nom	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Nom	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Nom	""" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ], but I do not expect it ,"" Griffin added ."
va	Nom	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
va	Nom	Normally this author is semi - objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi . com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ).
va	Nom	"If Abbas keeps up this "" macho talk "" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank ."
va	Nom	It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
va	Nom	He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
va	Nom	Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
va	Nom	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Nom	Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
va	Nom	""" We ' re not happy with Hamas ' s position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians ,"" commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official ."
va	Nom	""" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda ."""

va	Nom	If she has no male to fertilize the eggs , the eggs will aways be infertile .
va	Nom	if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs .
va	Nom	Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny !

va	Nom	Personally , I don ' t find a travel agent to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the internet .
va	Nom	I have not had good experience with travel agents .
va	Nom	They don ' t seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them .
va	Nom	The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for .
va	Nom	The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own , and more options than what they were selling .
va	Nom	So now I do not bother with them at all .

va	Gen	Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan . 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec . 25 , 2004 .
va	Gen	Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel ' s partially completed West Bank barrier .
va	Gen	Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
va	Gen	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .

va	Gen	"Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "" unrestricted "" strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight ."
va	Gen	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Gen	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."
va	Gen	Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

te	Gen	Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia ' s some 15 million citizens .
te	Gen	Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .

te	Nom	This BuzzMachine post argues that Google ' s rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we ' ve all heard before , but it ' s particularly well - put in this post .
te	Nom	They own blogger , of course .
te	Nom	I ' m staying away from the stock .
te	Nom	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Nom	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Nom	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Nom	You have to see these slides .... they are amazing .
te	Nom	I ' m not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument
te	Nom	( You don ' t need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you don ' t need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you ' re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ).
te	Nom	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Nom	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
te	Nom	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
te	Nom	They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti - proliferation treaty .
te	Nom	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn ' t even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
te	Nom	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
te	Nom	One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage .
te	Nom	He has denied this .
te	Nom	We don ' t have to believe him .
te	Nom	But we can ' t prove it .
te	Nom	It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof .
te	Nom	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Nom	"Let aggressive ( American ) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city ' s security and safety , and ask them to lift their hands from the city ."""
te	Nom	They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .
te	Nom	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
te	Nom	I ' ll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I ' m finished .
te	Nom	I had to go to the BBC for this report .
te	Nom	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Nom	It ' s just disappointing .
te	Nom	So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .
te	Nom	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Nom	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Nom	Which essentially sounds like he ' s worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
te	Nom	I assume his actual reason is that he ' s worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can ' t grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
te	Nom	I ' m not sure how the market will react .
te	Nom	It doesn ' t change the company ' s intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
te	Nom	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).
te	Nom	He mentions his wife ' s death having an effect on him .
te	Nom	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Nom	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
te	Nom	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."
te	Nom	I ' ve been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .
te	Nom	It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .
te	Nom	"The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , "" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah ."
te	Nom	"The statement said , "" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal ."""
te	Nom	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Nom	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Nom	Which is why he didn ' t say we ' re at war with Islamic people .
te	Nom	We ' re at war with Islamic fascists .
te	Nom	And if you haven ' t heard by now , the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :
te	Nom	Nabeel Hussain , 21 , Waltham Forest Lest you be confused with the suspects from an earlier plot foiled in Canada a few months ago : Fahim Ahmad , 21 , Toronto ;
te	Nom	We ' ve got a Steven , the one word that didn ' t crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .
te	Nom	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Nom	But because we don ' t want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone ' s a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it ' s ever been .
te	Nom	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Nom	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Nom	It is a setback for the war on terror .
te	Nom	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Nom	In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ).
te	Nom	They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .
te	Nom	They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .
te	Nom	( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ).
te	Nom	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Nom	Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .
te	Nom	Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9 / 11 if he had known it was coming .
te	Nom	"The question is , "" Should he have known it was coming ?"""
te	Nom	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
te	Nom	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Nom	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
te	Nom	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .
te	Nom	They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam ' s great white whale .
te	Nom	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Nom	They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to .
te	Nom	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
te	Nom	You also need Pakistani air space .
te	Nom	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn ' t use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
te	Nom	Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .
te	Nom	Of course , you could just go in by main force .
te	Nom	It should be easily googled .
te	Nom	"that is how i want you to refer to me as "" the king """
te	Nom	i don ' t think so .
te	Nom	i ' m the king

te	Nom	Thought that you might be interested .
te	Nom	Well , he launched today .
te	Nom	Have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today ?
te	Nom	I think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California ' s broken system --- a potential spoiler .
te	Nom	Well , wouldn ' t you know it .
te	Nom	I ' m not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil .
te	Nom	I ' m not sure , but I think that he ' s got class tonite , too .

te	Nom	As we discussed last week , since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants , we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks .

te	Nom	We will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today .

te	Nom	It looks like the war between Microsoft and Google is quickly brewing on the horizon .
te	Nom	Microsoft is 4 - 0 ( they took down Netscape , Suns Systems , MAC and IBM ) and Google may be their next target .
te	Nom	But it looks like Google isn ' t opening it ' s mouth about the reason behind the offer as Linux News reports :
te	Nom	""" While we don ' t have anything specific to announce today , Google and the Wikimedia Foundation are collaboratively evaluating creative ways to support Wikipedia . org and its community ."""
te	Nom	It will be interesting to see whether or not Google will finally slay the Microsoft Goliath , who has known no major defeat and seeks to vanquish all competition .
te	Nom	I ' m getting in touch because I think it could be useful to people campaigning about hospital closures .
te	Nom	We ' ve got a page dedicated to issues around hospitals ( http :// www . bbc . co . uk / dna / actionnetwork / C55153 ) and a group called NHS SOS have already put up a campaign about ward closures in Cumbria .
te	Nom	I ' m hoping to build this up to be a hub for all the campaigners - a place where people can exchange ideas and advice .
te	Nom	It would be great if the person from CHANT who started this page would put up a short description of the campaign and a list to this group page on the Action Network site .
te	Nom	Action Network is also a good place to post details of events , or try to rally together a group if you want to take action in your area .

te	Nom	"It looks like The Lunar Transportation Systems , Inc . is visualizing a "" space highway "" going from the moon to Earth ( and back again )."
te	Nom	They want to use LTS to tie into NASA ' s vision for Space Exploration , and seem pleased that the White House is moving in that direction .
te	Nom	""" We are so excited that the White House and the recent new government space policy underscores the need to involve the private sector in assisting NASA develop its plans for the new Vision for Space Exploration ,"" said Walter Kistler , LTS co - founder and Chairman ."
te	Nom	It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved .
te	Nom	Although these new rockets are probably more expensive , they will be able to go at a much greater range than it ' s shuttle cousins , as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well .
te	Nom	We could certainly slow the aging process down if it had to work its way through Congress .

te	Nom	"You don ' t ... there ' s no such thing as "" pause "" in digital recording ."
te	Nom	That ' s because of the buffer that holds the data until it ' s ready to be recorded to the memory card .
te	Nom	When you press the button to stop recording the data is moved from the buffer to the memory card - no pause .
te	Nom	All you can do is take each section ( individual video ) and edit them together on software .

te	Nom	What should I do ?
te	Nom	I ' ve tried bland white rice but he wont eat anything .
te	Nom	What could it be ?
te	Nom	Should I be concerned ?
te	Nom	esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY !!!
te	Nom	i doing a research paper on donatello and i notice that there are two statues of David , a bronze one and marble one .
te	Nom	Michelangelo made the marble one but why did he do another if Donatello had already made one ?
te	Nom	so im a little confused , why is there two statues of David ?
te	Nom	Because he liked making statues of David ! : D
te	Nom	Obviously , he should have been arrested and jailed - imagine making a statue or painting on the same subject as another artist - clearly insulting and disrespecting - wasted time that could have been used making a statue with clothes on .
te	Nom	I have a friend out in Chicago this week , and I am trying to remember the name of an awesome hibachi style restaurant i visited while out there a couple years ago .

te	Nom	If you have to wait , due to financial reasons , then wait .
te	Nom	I would much rather put it off until I can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as I ' m sure this trip is intended to be .
te	Nom	Airfare alone will be incredibly expensive so make sure you have the money and of course free time to take your time and have a great time .
te	Nom	the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in .
te	Nom	is it worthy to send in for warranty repair ?
te	Nom	I would agree .
te	Nom	I shoot a t1i and haven ' t had such an issue .
te	Nom	I also agree it ' s under warranty so get in touch with Canon .
te	Nom	It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re - boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re - start from time to time but it shouldn ' t be happening in a camera .
te	Nom	I ' m going on a vacation to the Philippines in May 2012 , and I ' m starting from Raleigh , NC ( RDU Airport ).

te	Nom	I don ' t want to have to deal with those deal - a - day websites like Groupon .
te	Nom	I just want a simple way to get a good deal to whatever Restaurant I want , whenever I want .
te	Nom	I usually use ZebraKlub .
te	Nom	They basically buy daily deals from Groupon , Living Social , and all sorts of other places .
te	Nom	So you can pretty much get whatever deal you want anytime .
te	Nom	Most of the deals let you eat for 500ff , and some of the deals are even free .
te	Nom	If you want to eat cheaply without worrying about all those daily deal emails every day , ZebraKlub should be perfect for you .
te	Nom	Where can I go on a first date ( adults )?
te	Nom	Looking for something on the casual side and we want it to be fun .
te	Nom	Or how about visiting the Chicago Botanical Gardens and see the change of colors and enjoy the air , They also have many inside exhibits you might enjoy , food is pretty good to .
te	Nom	You are busy , you don ' t have to sit face to face to try
te	Nom	to make convo , it ' s short , so if things go great , you can
te	Nom	extend , and if you want to end it , you just say bye ,
te	Nom	I decided to get a 150 gal aquarium , what can I fill it with ?
te	Nom	I was thinking cichlids ?
te	Nom	I ' ve never kept cichlids though .
te	Nom	I know saltwater is a possibility , can you give me a possible stocking option for that too ?
te	Nom	I ' ll choose the one that sounds the best after looking into all the fish :)
te	Nom	If you took out the clown loach it would make a nice 150 gallon tank .
te	Nom	for a tank that size i would suggest oscars or piranha every time awesome fish !!
te	Nom	It ' s well cool . :)
