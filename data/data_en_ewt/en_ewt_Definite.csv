tr	Def	Al - Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border .
tr	Def	Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior !
tr	Def	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J . Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s .
tr	Def	The third was being run by the head of an investment firm .
tr	Def	You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets .
tr	Def	The cells were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al - Jihad districts of the capital .
tr	Def	Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don ' t find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful .
tr	Def	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Def	The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings .
tr	Def	This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center - north of the country .)
tr	Def	In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district .
tr	Def	His mother was also killed in the attack .
tr	Def	Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half .
tr	Def	One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
tr	Def	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Def	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Def	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Def	The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas .
tr	Def	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Def	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Def	Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership .
tr	Def	The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way .
tr	Def	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Def	The trial begins again Nov . 28 .
tr	Def	In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya .
tr	Def	There has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again .
tr	Def	Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
tr	Def	Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars , they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area , then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK - 47 ' s in the air .
tr	Def	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year , which indicates they are the same people .
tr	Def	Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood , and those are trained and armed , so don ' t expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn ' t bomb them , and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen ?
tr	Def	Most people haven ' t gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal is ).
tr	Def	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Def	What irritates me is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi ' ite clerics , we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance , and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as ' Ba ' athists ', ' Saddamites ', ' Wahhabis ', and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago .
tr	Def	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Def	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al - Sahhaf .
tr	Def	Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents .
tr	Def	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Def	Elena ' s motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
tr	Def	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Def	This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following :
tr	Def	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
tr	Def	Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
tr	Def	In the last decade , there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise .
tr	Def	The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .
tr	Def	However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
tr	Def	The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
tr	Def	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post - accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
tr	Def	Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions .
tr	Def	These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl :
tr	Def	Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray ?
tr	Def	Don ' t have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks -- there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl .......
tr	Def	The Chernobyl Children ' s Project ( http :// www . adiccp . org / home / default . asp ) offers several ways to help the children of that region .
tr	Def	One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
tr	Def	The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming , and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have .
tr	Def	What do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
tr	Def	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
tr	Def	The tape was a way to signal priorities .
tr	Def	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Def	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Def	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Def	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .
tr	Def	MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelters Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .
tr	Def	Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .
tr	Def	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Def	On the other , restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People ' s Party , who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police .
tr	Def	On the other hand , the US should strong - arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue .
tr	Def	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Def	The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism , and even the threat of nuclear war , than Iraq ever did .
tr	Def	2 ) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government .
tr	Def	Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .
tr	Def	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Def	Israel owes the United States at least this much , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace .
tr	Def	3 ) Make Iraq another Afghanistan , using the Republican Right ' s own tactics against them .
tr	Def	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .
tr	Def	Certainly , the Shiites already hate al - Qaeda and would help ; likewise the Kurds .
tr	Def	The problem of mollifying the Sunnis , though , has to be solved to avoid giving al - Qaeda an entrée .
tr	Def	The Americans have to put away their free - market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households .
tr	Def	Of course , the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less - provocative local or international forces , the better .
tr	Def	Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn ' t nearly as good a rallying cry for al - Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out .
tr	Def	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Def	George W . Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .
tr	Def	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Def	"Texas Gov . George W . Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those names ."
tr	Def	The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
tr	Def	Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan .
tr	Def	He could not name the others .
tr	Def	""" Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan ?"""
tr	Def	Hiller asked , inquiring about Gen . Pervaiz Musharraf , who seized control of the country October 12 .
tr	Def	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Def	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Def	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Def	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Def	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Def	"I still remember him stuttering about "" the General ,"" unable to remember Musharraf ' s name ."
tr	Def	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Def	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Def	"This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "" stability "" to the region in fall of 1999 ."
tr	Def	Indeed , given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US , one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does .
tr	Def	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Def	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti - American terrorism .
tr	Def	Israel , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
tr	Def	Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
tr	Def	The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements .
tr	Def	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings .
tr	Def	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Def	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
tr	Def	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Def	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel ' s security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Def	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Def	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
tr	Def	Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians .
tr	Def	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Def	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Def	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Def	The bungling of post - war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state .
tr	Def	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
tr	Def	The more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran ' s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
tr	Def	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
tr	Def	Worse for Israel , the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites .
tr	Def	Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine .
tr	Def	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , which is popular in Jordan .
tr	Def	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post - Saddam Iraq are no exception .
tr	Def	That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites .
tr	Def	Israel ' s security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
tr	Def	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Def	The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world , including Iraq .
tr	Def	The promotion by the pro - Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened , not strengthened , Israeli security .
tr	Def	THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global
tr	Def	Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
tr	Def	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Def	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Def	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Def	And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s four - day visit to India recently .
tr	Def	According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
tr	Def	""" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one ."
tr	Def	"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive ,"" Muni told IPS ."
tr	Def	Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
tr	Def	But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .
tr	Def	Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .
tr	Def	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Def	Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .
tr	Def	""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement ,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview ."
tr	Def	In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .
tr	Def	Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .
tr	Def	However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .
tr	Def	About 1 , 200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .
tr	Def	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Def	Japan ' s special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
tr	Def	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Def	"The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces ."""
tr	Def	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Def	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Def	""" Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process ,"" TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement ."
tr	Def	"She added that recent visits to the island by India ' s top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island ""."
tr	Def	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Def	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Def	The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession .
tr	Def	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Def	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Def	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Def	Musharraf calls the bluff
tr	Def	Two years ago , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements .
tr	Def	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Def	The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
tr	Def	That distinction has now gone to the United States .
tr	Def	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Def	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Def	"This , Pakistan ' s lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told , is the "" minimum "" that the Pakistan army will accept ."
tr	Def	This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu - majority Jammu , a Buddhist - dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley , with the third state given little of taxpayers ' money but substantial autonomy .
tr	Def	With luck , the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist , education and services haven within India .
tr	Def	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U . S . State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .
tr	Def	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Def	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Def	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Def	"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
tr	Def	Despite Sept . 11 , the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy .
tr	Def	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Def	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Def	"That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "" foreigner - led "" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism , has not struck the conferees , among whom have been several Indian "" scholars "" and "" analysts "" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna ."
tr	Def	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Def	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
tr	Def	Since then , India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well .
tr	Def	Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell ' s bluff , challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands .
tr	Def	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Def	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Def	With Colin Powell around , the U . S . has no need of an Osama bin Laden
tr	Def	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Def	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Def	The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
tr	Def	Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush ' s service in the Texas Air National Guard .
tr	Def	What follows is the text of an e - mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ).
tr	Def	Read on to learn the facts .
tr	Def	Before you fall for Dems ’ spin , here are the facts
tr	Def	What do you really know about George W . Bush ’ s time in the Air National Guard ?
tr	Def	News coverage of the president ’ s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
tr	Def	So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :
tr	Def	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
tr	Def	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Def	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Def	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Def	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Def	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti - Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ).
tr	Def	“ The Vietnam War was winding down , and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs .
tr	Def	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Def	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Def	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Def	Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry ’ s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
tr	Def	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Def	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty .”
tr	Def	Now , after the Swift boat episode , the spotlight has returned to Bush .
tr	Def	His column appears in The Hill each week .
tr	Def	One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
tr	Def	I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week .
tr	Def	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Def	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5 , 000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
tr	Def	Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi ' s Al - Iraqiya list .
tr	Def	Indeed , Sistani ' s agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
tr	Def	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Def	Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha ' lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
tr	Def	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Def	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Def	The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
tr	Def	Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
tr	Def	I doubt that will be the outcome though .
tr	Def	Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
tr	Def	The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
tr	Def	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
tr	Def	After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can ' t mention here .
tr	Def	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Def	First driving out the Americans , then fighting the Shia back into submission ( as in 1991 ).
tr	Def	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
tr	Def	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Def	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Def	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Def	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Def	The only hope now is that , following the elections , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties .
tr	Def	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba ' athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
tr	Def	Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
tr	Def	Al - Gu ' ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government .
tr	Def	The Gu ' ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al - Anbar governor some months back .
tr	Def	The Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid - nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe .
tr	Def	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
tr	Def	Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
tr	Def	I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
tr	Def	The Shia cannot live without the Sunnis , and vice versa .
tr	Def	Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
tr	Def	I thought the US government was looking for me .
tr	Def	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Def	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Def	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Def	"Meiring ' s crimes are fresh , and wave the false flag which is the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Def	They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
tr	Def	( Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines .)
tr	Def	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Def	Posada ' s crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who don ' t know their history .
tr	Def	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Def	The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post - Chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
tr	Def	But Posada ' s nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that ' s a vain hope .
tr	Def	"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Def	Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
tr	Def	I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives .
tr	Def	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
tr	Def	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross - examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .
tr	Def	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
tr	Def	Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
tr	Def	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Def	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Def	Then Charles A . Briggs came to the rescue .
tr	Def	"The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson did not work "" directly or indirectly "" for the CIA since retiring ."
tr	Def	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .
tr	Def	Yesterday evening , the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany ( ARD , Tagesthemen ).
tr	Def	The newly released papers , showing him complicit in the airliner bombing , were mentioned

tr	Def	+ As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Def	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
tr	Def	In early February , India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ).
tr	Def	These alleged members of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have been charged with illegal entry .
tr	Def	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Def	Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels .
tr	Def	Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , which took a heavy toll on the Andamans .
tr	Def	"Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy ' s Far Eastern Naval Command , now being established along with India ' s "" blue water navy ""."
tr	Def	Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
tr	Def	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Def	The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base .
tr	Def	The drugs and arms travel in all directions .
tr	Def	"Since the "" Sea Tigers "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
tr	Def	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Def	As most of them have few technical skills , and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case , they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities .
tr	Def	The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns , cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous .
tr	Def	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Def	Considering the islands ' huge strategic importance , it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been .
tr	Def	These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily , bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia .
tr	Def	As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Def	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
tr	Def	With growing economic and military power , India will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security .
tr	Def	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Def	In fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti - India outfits , such as the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these networks and weaken India ' s eastern flank .
tr	Def	Indian intelligence ' s lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling .
tr	Def	This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid - 1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time .
tr	Def	"The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "" other terrorist groups ""."
tr	Def	The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo .
tr	Def	In addition , LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers .
tr	Def	The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now - defunct Asiaweek in 2001 .
tr	Def	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Def	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Def	In 1997 , the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition .
tr	Def	Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket - propelled - grenade launchers , 20 assault rifles , M - 79 grenade launchers and more than 10 , 000 rounds of ammunition .
tr	Def	Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People ' s Front .
tr	Def	Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
tr	Def	The boat was heading toward Cox ' s Bazar in Bangladesh .
tr	Def	Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante , an island off the coat of Myanmar , west of the Andaman islands .
tr	Def	Subsequently , Phuket became the LTTE ' s main backup base .
tr	Def	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Def	The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building - up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less - strong militant groups .
tr	Def	Over the past decade , Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness .
tr	Def	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Def	As a result , north of the Andaman Islands , Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms .
tr	Def	The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox ' s Bazar passes through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong .
tr	Def	India ' s Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1 , 000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal .
tr	Def	Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia .
tr	Def	The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans , which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south .
tr	Def	On South Andaman , the most heavily populated island , is Port Blair , which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago .
tr	Def	Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non - Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island .
tr	Def	[ Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Def	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Def	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Def	The neighbours are still interfering , but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’ s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it .
tr	Def	“ The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all .
tr	Def	All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process , but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan .
tr	Def	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Def	The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non - interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban .
tr	Def	Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting , said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully .
tr	Def	( Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban , Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb - e - Islami .)
tr	Def	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Def	‘’ Bush was very well briefed before the meeting ,’’ the diplomat said .
tr	Def	Karzai was clearly pleased at the results .
tr	Def	‘’ President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban ,’’ says Karzai .
tr	Def	The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans .
tr	Def	However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
tr	Def	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Def	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Def	Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
tr	Def	However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .
tr	Def	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Def	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Def	Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .
tr	Def	US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .
tr	Def	Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders , who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency .
tr	Def	With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections , the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .
tr	Def	With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home .
tr	Def	Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .
tr	Def	Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt . General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
tr	Def	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Def	Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Def	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Def	Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .
tr	Def	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Def	However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same .
tr	Def	With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’ s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced .
tr	Def	Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran ’ s border .
tr	Def	The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners .
tr	Def	Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand .
tr	Def	However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran .
tr	Def	‘’ Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran .
tr	Def	Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan ’ s neighbours is over , but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours ’ interference .
tr	Def	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Def	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Def	The debate that a handful of Texas multi - millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry ' s war record is absurd in every way .
tr	Def	The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
tr	Def	Most of those making the charges have even flip - flopped , contradicting themselves .
tr	Def	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Def	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Def	That is the logic of the medal ).
tr	Def	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Def	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Def	Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy .
tr	Def	"Even for those who later abstain , "" visual - spatial abilities , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , are the slowest to recover ."""
tr	Def	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Def	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Def	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Def	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Def	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Def	"There is one place in Alabama where Mr . Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Def	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Def	Groom was Republican Red Blount ' s scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
tr	Def	Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas , and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday .
tr	Def	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Def	On the phone , you could hear his accent .
tr	Def	GOODWYN : The candidate Mr . Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business .
tr	Def	Blount ' s support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon ' s postmaster general .
tr	Def	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Def	Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural counties didn ' t have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
tr	Def	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Def	Mr . MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ): Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid - evenings .
tr	Def	Ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5 : 30 or 6 : 00 in the evening .
tr	Def	GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of ' 72 , Red Blount ' s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr . Bush ' s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
tr	Def	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George certainly didn ' t seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there .
tr	Def	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Def	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Def	The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
tr	Def	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George didn ' t have any interest at all in talking about the military .
tr	Def	In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
tr	Def	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Def	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Def	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Def	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Def	Mr . ARCHIBALD : People have different ways of starting the days in any office .
tr	Def	They ' re going to talk about their kids , they ' re going to talk about football , they ' re going to talk about the weather .
tr	Def	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Def	GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr . Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
tr	Def	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Def	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Def	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Def	"But that means nothing , since they weren ' t the sort of things guys like Bush told the "" girls ""."
tr	Def	It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .

tr	Def	"From Wednesday ' s Mirror the headline , "" Have 200 , 000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists ?"""
tr	Def	( also see this thread on the RI discussion board ):
tr	Def	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Def	The 99 - tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia .
tr	Def	But the four planeloads of arms have vanished .
tr	Def	Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense .
tr	Def	But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
tr	Def	And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered .
tr	Def	But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights , which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005 .
tr	Def	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Def	"Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "" lost "" in Iraq , planeloads of arms don ' t just "" vanish ""; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout ' s untouchable stature ."
tr	Def	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Def	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Def	The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
tr	Def	Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .
tr	Def	""" It was about how he could humiliate her the most ,"" prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments ."
tr	Def	"After the sentencing one of Robinson ' s tearful supporters "" turned to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [ SNAP ], who had helped reopen the case , and told her , ' I hope you rot in hell !'"""

tr	Def	And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation .
tr	Def	Police and prosecutors have the tools .
tr	Def	The will is another matter .
tr	Def	That ' s still the domain of those who don ' t .
tr	Def	talk about law enforcement not having the will ...
tr	Def	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
tr	Def	"Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI ' s list of "" Ten Most Wanted Fugitives ,"" a move that caps law enforcement ' s dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ...[ because of ] the impact that the group ' s practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women ."
tr	Def	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Def	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Def	As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo - Nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs has preached racism as well .
tr	Def	""" The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth ,"" Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center ' s "" Intelligence Report ."""
tr	Def	I ' m sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
tr	Def	The Raw Story
tr	Def	Then , of course , there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case ...
tr	Def	Of course law enforcement has dragged it ' s feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
tr	Def	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
tr	Def	Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life .
tr	Def	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
tr	Def	Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time .
tr	Def	It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child .
tr	Def	The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure .
tr	Def	Also look up the kingston family .
tr	Def	no one was charged for forced marriage , only the beating .

tr	Def	They really are milking the incompetence angle though , aren ' t they ?

tr	Def	The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ...
tr	Def	And MEK -- the Iranian ( not Iraqi ) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult :
tr	Def	As the leaders like to boast , the Mujahedeen is a family affair .
tr	Def	Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf , where they lived separated from their parents .
tr	Def	When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
tr	Def	When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
tr	Def	Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
tr	Def	'' Every morning and night , the kids , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute them and shout praises to them ,'' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told me .
tr	Def	Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
tr	Def	Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France .
tr	Def	The Rajavis , Afshari went on to say , '' saw these kids as the next generation ' s soldiers .
tr	Def	Which may explain the pattern to their stories : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .
tr	Def	One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don ' t know what they are , don ' t care , or know perfectly well .

tr	Def	They were death metal brainwashed fans , literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
tr	Def	I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article .
tr	Def	The deathly inversion of truth , ala satanism .
tr	Def	I think the jury ' s still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers .
tr	Def	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter - cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but doesn ' t apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
tr	Def	The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .
tr	Def	The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion .
tr	Def	The following quote is from that Coogan article :
tr	Def	The answer is likely D : all of the above , due to this being a complex reality we live in .

tr	Def	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Def	It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
tr	Def	"Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : "" To hell with death ""."
tr	Def	The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
tr	Def	And for ' Smartwolf ' above , think about the inversion principle being employed .
tr	Def	( I know , ignorant question ) Then why call them , or any other phonies ' Christians ', even if they themselves claim the appellation .
tr	Def	They want to be identified as ' Christians ', and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician ' s practice of the inversion principle .

tr	Def	Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
tr	Def	The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result .
tr	Def	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Def	Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .

tr	Def	Does the distinction actually exist ?
tr	Def	This is where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum comes into play .
tr	Def	My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
tr	Def	Not 200 , 000 guns - the numbers dont work :

tr	Def	Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
tr	Def	For example , is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?
tr	Def	The ' high weirdness ' and more hardcore political ' factions ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
tr	Def	In regards to death metal , the problem is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture .
tr	Def	Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well ?
tr	Def	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
tr	Def	I just get hung up on ' Christians ', as they ' re the dominant form where I come from .
tr	Def	Also , I ' m quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses .
tr	Def	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush ' s claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
tr	Def	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .

tr	Def	My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
tr	Def	You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
tr	Def	I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
tr	Def	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
tr	Def	I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non - Arab and also significant non - Moslem minorities .
tr	Def	Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
tr	Def	The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Def	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Def	The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Def	Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60 ' s because of Israel .
tr	Def	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Def	The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Def	The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
tr	Def	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
tr	Def	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Def	Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
tr	Def	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Def	Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
tr	Def	The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
tr	Def	Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
tr	Def	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Def	The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
tr	Def	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Def	* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder .*
tr	Def	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Def	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
tr	Def	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
tr	Def	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
tr	Def	So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
tr	Def	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Def	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
tr	Def	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
tr	Def	The U . S . and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
tr	Def	We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
tr	Def	How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
tr	Def	Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
tr	Def	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
tr	Def	What is behind the suicide murders ?
tr	Def	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Def	Aren ' t they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
tr	Def	They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
tr	Def	The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
tr	Def	There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
tr	Def	"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
tr	Def	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Def	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
tr	Def	"You must go after the head of the "" Family ""."
tr	Def	If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
tr	Def	The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
tr	Def	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
tr	Def	The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
tr	Def	* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies .*
tr	Def	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
tr	Def	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Def	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Def	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
tr	Def	But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
tr	Def	When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
tr	Def	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
tr	Def	You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
tr	Def	She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
tr	Def	"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and "" activist "" by the European press ."
tr	Def	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
tr	Def	* 3 . The third aspect is money .*
tr	Def	Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
tr	Def	In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
tr	Def	The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
tr	Def	The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
tr	Def	These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
tr	Def	Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
tr	Def	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Def	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Def	The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO ' s and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
tr	Def	The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
tr	Def	The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
tr	Def	Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
tr	Def	The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
tr	Def	Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
tr	Def	Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
tr	Def	You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
tr	Def	"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
tr	Def	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Def	* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws .*
tr	Def	The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
tr	Def	There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
tr	Def	Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
tr	Def	These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
tr	Def	All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
tr	Def	Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
tr	Def	Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
tr	Def	The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
tr	Def	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Def	"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as "" war criminals ,"" with some Western media repeating the allegations ."
tr	Def	The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
tr	Def	The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
tr	Def	After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
tr	Def	But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .
tr	Def	The picture I described here is not pretty .
tr	Def	In the short run , only fight and win .
tr	Def	In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
tr	Def	The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
tr	Def	The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force .
tr	Def	Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter - propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
tr	Def	"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" supplies "" from expanding the tumor ."
tr	Def	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Def	I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre - war argument , but I can look at the post - war map of Western Asia .
tr	Def	Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
tr	Def	Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
tr	Def	I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
tr	Def	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Def	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Def	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Def	Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
tr	Def	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Def	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Def	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Def	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Def	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Def	No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
tr	Def	What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
tr	Def	The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
tr	Def	In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
tr	Def	Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
tr	Def	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Def	It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
tr	Def	On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
tr	Def	I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
tr	Def	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Def	Europe , more than any other region , is the key .
tr	Def	"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."""

tr	Def	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Def	The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities .
tr	Def	Mabruk , at the time , was the head of Jihad ' s military operations .
tr	Def	Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9 / 11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
tr	Def	KSM explained that Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US - trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative , Malaysian Yazid Sufaat .
tr	Def	"Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable , has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "" anthrax for Jew sympathizer only ."""
tr	Def	KSM and Hambali sent al - Hindi ( al - Britani ), along with Jafar the Pilot , to case NYC targets for a second wave .
tr	Def	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Def	Sufaat , according to both KSM and Hambali , did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used .
tr	Def	That would require someone who had access to the strain .
tr	Def	But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri ' s decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter .
tr	Def	The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years .
tr	Def	Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
tr	Def	He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader .
tr	Def	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Def	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Def	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Def	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Def	After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow , Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape .
tr	Def	He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise .
tr	Def	Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9 / 11 on US soil .
tr	Def	According to some reports , Zawahiri is thought by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
tr	Def	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Def	"In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop ( from 1995 ) that was signed "" Khalid Sheik Bojinka ""?"
tr	Def	The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released .
tr	Def	In May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9 / 11 Commission .
tr	Def	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Def	The same week , the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes , they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received .
tr	Def	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Def	The CIA has known of Zawahiri ' s plans to use anthrax for a half decade .
tr	Def	The confidante and right - hand man of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets .
tr	Def	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Def	The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts .
tr	Def	There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 .
tr	Def	Significantly , the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ), upon being contacted , does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft . Detrick .
tr	Def	Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed ' s computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons .
tr	Def	At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek , under the optimal method , there is no electrostatic charge .
tr	Def	In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings , there was an electrostatic charge .
tr	Def	Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
tr	Def	"The "" trillion spore "" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
tr	Def	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Def	Although the details of the documents on Mohammed ' s computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings .
tr	Def	Al Qaeda had both the means and opportunity .
tr	Def	JI has ties with the Moro Front .
tr	Def	"The crop dusters were to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Def	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Def	The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax .
tr	Def	Various doctors , both foreign and American , are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives , to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan , a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui , PhD , from Karachi .
tr	Def	Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the fugitives .
tr	Def	Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning .
tr	Def	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Def	The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt .
tr	Def	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Def	As agent Van Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation said , the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information .
tr	Def	According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative ' s house ).
tr	Def	( Karachi is in the south ).
tr	Def	"The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda ' s "" Chemical Wire Group ."""
tr	Def	The family ' s lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station .
tr	Def	That was the last Ismat heard from her .
tr	Def	Aafia never reached the uncle ' s house .
tr	Def	"Perhaps something got lost in the translation , but the phrase "" Chemical Wire Group "" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers ."
tr	Def	The family ' s attorney advises me that Aafia had no knowledge of chemicals ( and that would not appear to be her training ).
tr	Def	"His nickname is "" Jafar the Pilot ."""
tr	Def	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Def	The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically - based preconceptions .
tr	Def	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Def	The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan .
tr	Def	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Def	The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program at Kandahar .
tr	Def	The present evidence relating to Atta ' s alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq .
tr	Def	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Def	The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq ' s secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
tr	Def	According to at least some reports , Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad .
tr	Def	Two top Iraqi scientists , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi ' s anthrax program , according to Dr . David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
tr	Def	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Def	"The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "" liberals ."""
tr	Def	"Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "" Leahy Law "" to military and security forces ."
tr	Def	That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals .
tr	Def	Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI ' s involvement in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries .
tr	Def	Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries .
tr	Def	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Def	This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remains foremost in the mind of Dr . Zawahiri .
tr	Def	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Def	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Def	Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq .
tr	Def	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Def	Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
tr	Def	The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention .
tr	Def	"Most of the "" talking heads "" on television , however , knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers ."
tr	Def	The FBI ' s profile includes a US - based supporter of the militant islamists .
tr	Def	"The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "" domestic "" the word includes a US - based , highly - educated supporter of the militant islamists ."
tr	Def	( The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun ).
tr	Def	( News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun .)
tr	Def	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Def	The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D . C ..
tr	Def	They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman .
tr	Def	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Def	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
tr	Def	The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message .
tr	Def	Once one had been received , the next ten , mailed on two separate dates , were easily collected .
tr	Def	( The position does not exist ).
tr	Def	That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 .
tr	Def	Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr . Abdul Qadoos Khan .
tr	Def	Although while in jail in the early 1980s , Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik ' s ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group , Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman ' s friends .
tr	Def	The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM ' s nephew .
tr	Def	Thus , the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center .
tr	Def	"According to the controversial "" Feith memo ,"" which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi / Al Qaeda connection , Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent ."
tr	Def	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Def	"The "" Federal Eagle "" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue - green ."
tr	Def	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""
tr	Def	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Def	"Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "" The 19 Martyrs ."""
tr	Def	"The mailer ' s use of "" Greendale School "" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing ."
tr	Def	Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed ' s color .
tr	Def	By Greendale School , the anthrax perp was being cute , just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
tr	Def	Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i . e ., Cairo ' s Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group .
tr	Def	The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
tr	Def	At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained , recruits would wear green uniforms , except for Friday when they were washed .
tr	Def	The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought .
tr	Def	Zawahiri ' s mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes .
tr	Def	Whatever your political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve our support .
tr	Def	First , the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI is doing .
tr	Def	"Third , with the "" new age "" Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . in charge of the investigation , it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security ."
tr	Def	"Finally , the "" Hatfill theory "" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor ."
tr	Def	"The "" Hatfill theory "" accusing Dr . Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious ."
tr	Def	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .
tr	Def	The FBI ' s fixation on Hatfill ( at least as rumored by some reporters ) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance .
tr	Def	Leahy ' s chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right - winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted .
tr	Def	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
tr	Def	The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
tr	Def	The judge , frustrated by the apparent lack of progress , encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed ( and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint ).
tr	Def	The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory , with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances .
tr	Def	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Def	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him .
tr	Def	Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets ( August Board meeting ) one more time before I forward it to you .
tr	Def	He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc .) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
tr	Def	For now , this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and / or inflation curves .
tr	Def	I will send the specifics per Andre later today .
tr	Def	I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting / IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already .
tr	Def	Please send us the list of the curves that you will need to revalue our international assets for the August Board meeting .

tr	Def	Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund , telling me to invest in Home Depot , Sun , and Coke , or trying to pass off their banks ' biased research reports as something valuable .

tr	Def	We ' ll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options .

tr	Def	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
tr	Def	By the way , I am interested in re - looking at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that your gallery had a couple of years ago .
tr	Def	Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .

tr	Def	On the issue of the contracts , the draft says that the $ 170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed .
tr	Def	Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed ?
tr	Def	1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i . e ., ONSI would be a lot more money ).
tr	Def	Hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
tr	Def	2 . The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .
tr	Def	In order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 .

tr	Def	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent ' s return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .
tr	Def	I don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .
tr	Def	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards .
tr	Def	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .

tr	Def	The other staff reports are also looking good .
tr	Def	Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large , regulated utility in California .
tr	Def	Thanks for attributing the quote to me .
tr	Def	I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach .
tr	Def	Given the short notice , we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday , but will let the good Senator know that , in general , we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody .
tr	Def	Can we get some help on the IBM issues ?
tr	Def	This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
tr	Def	No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
tr	Def	Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
tr	Def	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Def	The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
tr	Def	They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .
tr	Def	Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning BackWeb before we proceed .
tr	Def	As you can see from the Design Document , they are pretty significant .
tr	Def	Please be advised that I have set the call as follows :
tr	Def	the deal number is 814014 - why can ' t you see this ?
tr	Def	Can you give me the Sitara deal #?
tr	Def	Otherwise , I will assume you will book the two tickets .
tr	Def	Actually - upon second look the deal number is 814014 - why can ' t you see this ?
tr	Def	Can you give me the Sitara deal #?
tr	Def	Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary ?
tr	Def	Sorry about the flooding .
tr	Def	Attached are the gas settlement and support for May .
tr	Def	The only difference we had was for package V02 .
tr	Def	Mark Anderson says that even though Bondad gas flowed , the price was Non - Bondad .
tr	Def	Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary ?
tr	Def	Sorry about the flooding .
tr	Def	Attached are the gas settlement and support for May .
tr	Def	The only difference we had was for package V02 .
tr	Def	Mark Anderson says that even though Bondad gas flowed , the price was Non - Bondad .
tr	Def	Nancy , can you please reconfirm with Mark the price for the gas at Bondad ?
tr	Def	Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary ?
tr	Def	Sorry about the flooding .
tr	Def	Attached are the gas settlement and support for May .

tr	Def	Please quote the Gas on an Indexed Basis .
tr	Def	I have not had the patience to get it working - I will callyou some evening and we can walk thru it .

tr	Def	OK , I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE .
tr	Def	And I bet she ' s on the phone with Shemin too !!!
tr	Def	Also , it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly .
tr	Def	The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET - 2 or NET - 284 .
tr	Def	You review and approve it , keep it on your desk , and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday .
tr	Def	By the way , Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray .
tr	Def	This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark - up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago .

tr	Def	She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives .
tr	Def	"Ms . Walters approached one of the women and said , "" This is marvelous ."
tr	Def	"Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles ?"""
tr	Def	""" Land mines ,"" said the Kuwaiti woman ."
tr	Def	Cullen and Dykman ( attorneys for Boston Gas Company ) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas .
tr	Def	"They also made one other change , they are taking out the "" subject to recall "" language at the bottom of page 2 under item # 1 ."
tr	Def	They will be sending the revised document to me .
tr	Def	I CAN HANDLE THE TRACTOR .
tr	Def	love TO HAVE YOU ALONG FOR THE COMPANY , BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY .
tr	Def	I didn ' t feel guilty about the garage sale , that ' s why I was annoyed - being notified at 10 : 00 at night GRRRRRRR .
tr	Def	So I ' m going with you , I pay for the gas and the twinkies .
tr	Def	Jack welch is the CEO of GE , not GM .
tr	Def	The eThink Team
tr	Def	The response was tremendous and , in some cases , very creative .
tr	Def	Here are the top ten most requested eSpeakers .
tr	Def	7 . Stephen Covey , author , The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
tr	Def	I will see you in the lobby at 7am .
tr	Def	What about 7 : 00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7 : 00 ?
tr	Def	I ' ll initiate the call .
tr	Def	I ' ll still be here in Boston so we ' d do it over the phone .
tr	Def	Will you be in Houston on that day or we shall do it over the phone ?
tr	Def	I would like the pre - meeting site cruise .
tr	Def	How is the site doing ?
tr	Def	I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman , Morgan , BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours .
tr	Def	After one month ' s full - bore effort , I ' m pleased with the results ( e . g ., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ).
tr	Def	P . S . By the way , did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL ?
tr	Def	If possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .
tr	Def	We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz .
tr	Def	We would still keep the 20 , 000 , 000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement .
tr	Def	The line in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral .
tr	Def	The 20 mill reflects gross exposure .
tr	Def	We too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us .
tr	Def	We could change the language of the POA to this ...
tr	Def	we will not go over Global ' s piece of the Cargill line ...
tr	Def	These have been compared against the draft dated 11 / 8 / 2000 , and include ENA ' s accepted changes per your ( a ) faxed comments transmitted to ENA on January 5 , 2001 , and ( b ) e - mail comments transmitted to ENA on January 19th , 2001 .
tr	Def	I wanted to follow up with you regarding the creation and approval of ISDA Confirmations for the following equity trades that I understand Laurel had discussed with you previously .

tr	Def	"At some point in the not so distant future , the Houson and London credit departments need to speak in order that each understands the "" philosophy "" behind credit analysis for the omnibus and master transactions ."
tr	Def	We need to change the Prod Description fro the LME Product .
tr	Def	"The change is mainly on the Settlement Date text , which instead of ""... Two business days after the date of the Transaction ..."" shall read as follow :"
tr	Def	The Base Currency Amount shall equal the volume submitted by the Counterparty via the Website .
tr	Def	The Foreign Currency Amount shall equal the Base Currency Amount , multiplied by the daily London Metal Exchange ( LME ) fixing rate as published by Reuters on page MTLE on the date of the transaction , modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty via the Website .

tr	Def	I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights .
tr	Def	His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L . L . C .
tr	Def	This language has been included in the attached draft .

tr	Def	Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day .

tr	Def	Attached is the referenced agreement .
tr	Def	Let me know if the notice information is OK with you .
tr	Def	I ' m not sure you have the authority to sign documents w / o special authority ...
tr	Def	"Adding all the Enron "" Specified Entities "" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement ."
tr	Def	If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
tr	Def	"With respect to Deutsche Bank ("""" DB ""), we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
tr	Def	Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue .
tr	Def	With respect to First Union National Bank , the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11 / 8 / 00 for review .
tr	Def	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co - signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we ' re OK .
tr	Def	The referenced TAGG # was entered as a ' New Counterparty ', can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure .
tr	Def	I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don ' t think I ' m going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
tr	Def	I ' m planning on dragging him to at least one of the U . T . games , I just have to find out when he wants to go ( as well as properly prepare him for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that is a U . T . game ).
tr	Def	"I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" Rent "" and it was wonderful ."
tr	Def	Also , I ' m going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot ' s daughter Julie .
tr	Def	I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
tr	Def	Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what ' s going on in Houston .
tr	Def	Hey Tonto ( a . k . a - the trusty , but silent , side - kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D )
tr	Def	The play was very good and I think well received .
tr	Def	I ' d forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
tr	Def	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling ).
tr	Def	I caught the third day of Corey ' s Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job !).
tr	Def	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went .
tr	Def	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn ' t spell her name right in the email - I mean it ' s such a common spelling .
tr	Def	Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch .
tr	Def	"Good luck with all of the "" fun "" meetings ."
tr	Def	-- Due to the lack of response yesterday , I ' m beginning to worry about your success with the road test ...
tr	Def	How was the play ?
tr	Def	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
tr	Def	However , having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors .
tr	Def	Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have established , I have the memory of an elephant ).
tr	Def	Thought you ' d like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec . 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it ' s all about you and your needs .
tr	Def	I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam both written and on the rode .
tr	Def	I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ).
tr	Def	There is no pleasure in having nothing to do ; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it .
tr	Def	"Note that the No "" Out "" version requires us to pay the premium on Tuesday !"
tr	Def	As we discussed , the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue :

tr	Def	He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub Hospital .?
tr	Def	He cannot accept calls , visits or flowers at this time , since he is in the emergency room .?
tr	Def	Argentina intend to press ahead even given the concern about taxes , etc .
tr	Def	Just wanted to know were we stand on the ETA and PA for Argentina ?
tr	Def	I am thinking 4 slides at the most .
tr	Def	Days away : Sept . 21 through Oct . 3 ( assuming you work on the day we leave and go back to work the day after we return )
tr	Def	I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI ( based in London ).
tr	Def	Thanks for the reminder .
tr	Def	Note that the credit thresholds are in US $, but the MACS are designated in British Pounds .
tr	Def	Please send the draft to Troy Black and he will forward to the CP .
tr	Def	I looked at the UEComm Master and had some comments -- such as our name is wrong , the cross default threshold for us should be US $ and not AUD , and there were a few other questions I had .
tr	Def	Attached are Uecomm ' s final comments to the Master Agreement .
tr	Def	John Suttle has OK ' d Anthony ' s latest request w / r . t . the CSA .
tr	Def	Please find attached the Enron Master Agreement .
tr	Def	I have inserted the company details of Uecomm as requested .

tr	Def	Please note that the economic provisions have been omitted .
tr	Def	Here ' s info on the Elliotts .
tr	Def	"We ' ve been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "" Babies Elliott "" had arrived ."

tr	Def	"Although small , they are all "" fully functioning "" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care ( and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks ) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights ."
tr	Def	All the best and kind regards
tr	Def	Attached are the fax cover pages for each of the Nylon and Polykron Deemed ISDAs I just sent you .
tr	Def	Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp . likes their resolutions drafted than we are .
tr	Def	I am following up regarding the status of our comments to the form of guaranty for Pemex that you provided to Lucy Ortiz .
tr	Def	Will you pass along to the appropriate person ?
tr	Def	per our conversation yesterday afternoon , attached are proposed drafts of the Schedule and the Para . 13 relative to the above .
tr	Def	Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann , I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $ 8M each : one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f / b / o Enron , and one by Enron Inc . f / b / o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing .
tr	Def	I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $ 10M for each party , but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly .
tr	Def	After you have had the chance to review the attached , please send me a marked - up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there .
tr	Def	Attached are the draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement , together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex .
tr	Def	I am putting the credit worksheet on the fax machine to you as soon as I send this message .
tr	Def	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
tr	Def	If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
tr	Def	I ' m now looking closely at the option liquidation problems .
tr	Def	Karim - this ' s likely the explanation to your other question ...
tr	Def	The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608 .
tr	Def	I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $ 65 puts are in the money and the $ 75 call is also in the money .
tr	Def	Shouldn ' t all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative ( representing positive liquidation ) for the puts ?
tr	Def	The liq value for the call is CORRECT .
tr	Def	I don ' t want to wait till month end , let ' s adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order , lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts .

tr	Def	The Toronto office will be video conferenced in .
tr	Def	Attached is the revised draft paper that reflects our conference call with Bob Fagan earlier this week .
tr	Def	Also , would those of you who have not responded to me via email confirming your acceptance of the terms upon which our four companies have agreed to assume cost responsibility for the TCA work on this .
tr	Def	Attached is the letter I originally sent to you on May 10 in this regard .
tr	Def	This draft reflects the changes we discussed during our call the other day .
tr	Def	We will be targeting to raise at least $ 100 , 000 so company contributions will range from $ 10 , 000 -$ 20 , 000 per person ($ 10k minimum per person ) depending on the number of respondents .
tr	Def	I ' m glad they want to follow - up with Steve ( I ' ve been pushing it ) and I ' ve got some follow - up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post - call .
tr	Def	We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the CPUC .
tr	Def	Also , can you confirm the correct names , email addresses , titles for those new folks on Friday ' s call : Robbie Rossi , Michelle , Melissa Lloyd ?
tr	Def	Attached for your review are draft talking points for the Cal Energy Markets conference I ' m speaking at on Thursday in SF .
tr	Def	Here ' s the info for calling in -- thanks !
tr	Def	The call - in number and instructions for the 11 / 2 8 : 30 a . m . meeting are as follows :
tr	Def	Everyone will dial the toll free number 1 - 877 - 331 - 6867 .
tr	Def	All the outside participants will be prompted to enter their access code , which is 600 - 480 .
tr	Def	Wayne , your access code ( room 4434 ) after dialing the toll free number will be 857 - 771 .
tr	Def	I have asked for 4 outside ports and should anyone else need to join in , they may do so with the access code and without operator assistance .
tr	Def	The duration of the call is 3 . 5 hours .
tr	Def	The call will terminate once everyone has hung up .
tr	Def	Attached for your review are copies of the settlement documents that were filed today in the Gas Industry Restructuring / Natural Gas Strategy proceeding , including the Motion for Approval of the Comprehensive Settlement that is supported by thirty signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement , the Comprehensive Settlement document itself , and the various appendices to the settlement .?
tr	Def	Hard copies of the Comprehensive Settlement , including all declarations and signature pages , are being shipped tonight via US mail to all parties on the service list .?
tr	Def	Additional printed copies should be available within the next day or so and I will make them available to all of you - just let me know how many copies you need .
tr	Def	I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement process .?
tr	Def	You have all devoted considerable time , resources and spirit in the preparation of this document - and it shows .?
tr	Def	While we should be proud of our accomplishment , we now must turn to the task of getting our testimony ready by May 5 deadline .?
tr	Def	Goal is to ( politely ?) refute Loretta Lynch ' s and Carl Woods ' continued assertions that 1 ) California ' s move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2 ) the solution is to turn back the clock to command - and - control regulation .
tr	Def	The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat .
tr	Def	As we discussed yesterday , Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday .
tr	Def	We ' ll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S . D . last week .
tr	Def	As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
tr	Def	Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
tr	Def	Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ), I ' d say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
tr	Def	I hope the above is clear .
tr	Def	If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system ; you should not copy the message or disclose its contents to anyone .
tr	Def	Per my conversation with Edmund this morning , we are moving the following countries to the non - approved list : Austria , Belgium , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Singapore , and Slovenia .
tr	Def	Below is the list , now updated to reflect this change .
tr	Def	Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives : Finland , Germany , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland , the U . K , and the U . S ..
tr	Def	Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include : Austria , Belgium , Canada , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , France , Gibraltar , Ireland , Italy , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Scotland , Singapore , Slovenia , Spain , and The Netherlands .
tr	Def	Yes , we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and / or Commodity Contracts and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act ( Alberta ), Securities Act ( British Columbia ) and Securities Act ( Ontario ).
tr	Def	"With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with , do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "" eligible swap participant "" equivalant rules ?"
tr	Def	You are the best !
tr	Def	The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract .
tr	Def	We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas , which adds the Canadian Securities Representation , so we don ' t have to add the rep into every confirm .
tr	Def	BC Gas won ' t sign the confirms with the rep in , and this has caused much difficulties .
tr	Def	We have received the executed Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade , Inc . dated March 2 , 2000 .
tr	Def	This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph ( c ) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement .
tr	Def	It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on , and you probably didn ' t see them at first .
tr	Def	I didn ' t either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up .
tr	Def	I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives , and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London .
tr	Def	He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business .
tr	Def	the company is Arco Products , adn their comments are on the attached file .
tr	Def	Torrey , as promised I have attached ARCO ' s suggested revisions to the Enron online trading agreement .
tr	Def	We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1 , 1999 .
tr	Def	This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities Act representation to the master .
tr	Def	Confirmation Desk : you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now .
tr	Def	Here ' s the list with the missing counterparties .
tr	Def	Please find attached the most recent update for Merchanting Metals .
tr	Def	In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are behind schedule .
tr	Def	Additional resources are being allocated and the situation is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operations ).
tr	Def	The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account
tr	Def	Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .
tr	Def	Consequently I need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the following :
tr	Def	I will discuss with AA the following
tr	Def	that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications )
tr	Def	that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses , AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable )
tr	Def	The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
tr	Def	The signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate ' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
tr	Def	We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .
tr	Def	The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
tr	Def	the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co - ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ), requiring full download of contract detail for later reference
tr	Def	spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
tr	Def	the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
tr	Def	the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd
tr	Def	I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval
tr	Def	"Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ("" OBSF "") which commenced two weeks before the year end ."
tr	Def	The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA ' s signoff for the facility late in the year end audit .
tr	Def	The discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the AS400 Merchanting code , arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality , which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF .
tr	Def	The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
tr	Def	The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave .
tr	Def	The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
tr	Def	Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet .
tr	Def	The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers .
tr	Def	The AR / AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1 .
tr	Def	The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA / excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads .
tr	Def	Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
tr	Def	Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
tr	Def	Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
tr	Def	I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April
tr	Def	I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application .
tr	Def	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year .
tr	Def	I understand how competitive the process has become , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , personality , extracurricular activities , etc . that this would compensate for my disability .
tr	Def	After talking with Professors Titman , Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for .
tr	Def	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Def	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level .
tr	Def	I also plan on retaking the GMAT test .
tr	Def	I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program .
tr	Def	In the end , the results were not favorable .
tr	Def	After talking with you and Professors Titman , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy - finance .
tr	Def	I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Def	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level .
tr	Def	I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test .
tr	Def	Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me .

tr	Def	I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test .
tr	Def	I know that with my industry - wide and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund .
tr	Def	Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me .
tr	Def	Sorry about that , I was working on the Teco O & M costs .
tr	Def	I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
tr	Def	As such , please provide the following detail :
tr	Def	What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub ?
tr	Def	Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/ MWh to value the deal ?
tr	Def	What expiration date are you using , i . e .: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?
tr	Def	Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option ?
tr	Def	"Are you using the "" SPRDOPT "" Exotic Options function to value the option ?"
tr	Def	Are you using the $/ MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike ?
tr	Def	Has Don provided the fixed payment stream ?
tr	Def	Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC ' s goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
tr	Def	This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .
tr	Def	Randy , this is the issue I left you the voice mail on .
tr	Def	"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to "" work in good faith with CDEC "" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC ' s system ."
tr	Def	"We will fight with them about who owes the $ 200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "" assist "" us in managing the cost ."
tr	Def	In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .
tr	Def	James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info . from CDEC .
tr	Def	Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management .
tr	Def	We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200 , 987 . 33 for the period of July through September .
tr	Def	Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , that I have not been able to review yet .
tr	Def	This cost is averaging $ 79 , 000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September .
tr	Def	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .
tr	Def	None of them did , and most importantly , the winning bidders did not .
tr	Def	Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates .
tr	Def	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
tr	Def	My concern with adding the language below is , could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate ??
tr	Def	After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we ' ve done .
tr	Def	However , as you will see , the questions I thought of got kinda long - but I think we need answers for all of them .
tr	Def	One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I ' ve listed .
tr	Def	Here is the attachment ...
tr	Def	Please review it and let me know if you have any comments on or before Tuesday afternoon ( I will be out of the office Monday ).
tr	Def	Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair ( she only wanted one , however ).
tr	Def	The cost is $ 567 . 77 per chair plus tax .
tr	Def	Please approve the purchase of two .
tr	Def	sorry , i left lou off of the message .
tr	Def	Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair ( she only wanted one , however ).
tr	Def	The cost is $ 567 . 77 per chair plus tax .
tr	Def	Please approve the purchase of two .
tr	Def	She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him .
tr	Def	Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer ' s duplicity , but after tempers cooled , MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response .
tr	Def	As it stands , MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers .
tr	Def	Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he ' s on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation .
tr	Def	The next meeting of the CAEM Board of Directors will be held on Wednesday , September 12 , at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington , DC .
tr	Def	The meeting is being held in conjunction with the third meeting of our DISCO of the Future Forum .
tr	Def	( Please visit our newly updated website www . caem . org for more information on the DISCO Forum .)
tr	Def	Following the Board meeting on Wednesday , you are invited to join with members of the DISCO Forum for a Wednesday evening reception and dinner , including a guest speaker .
tr	Def	Board members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO Forum on Thursday , September 13 .
tr	Def	To reserve one of these rooms , you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group .
tr	Def	We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to members of the DISCO Forum on July 20 .
tr	Def	We are receiving invoices from Ace Federal Reporters for transcripts of the recent FERC settlement conferences .
tr	Def	Do you want me to send the invoices to you ?
tr	Def	Can we visit about what went on with Ursula at the PRC meeting when you catch up ?
tr	Def	Please disregard and destroy the form you received on July 2 , as well as any blank forms retrieved from the PEP system prior to that date .
tr	Def	Please use the attached for Associate and Analyst evaluations .
tr	Def	We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions .
tr	Def	Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information .
tr	Def	We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
tr	Def	The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue , providing specific examples and proposing the solution .
tr	Def	Those who show up and complain , but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls , board meetings , etc . are ignored .
tr	Def	Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
tr	Def	( Even though he has bigger things to do in D . C ., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas , the repercussions could be global .)
tr	Def	Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens ( of the Texas legislature ) are also engaged in market developments .
tr	Def	We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised .
tr	Def	The forum is expected to be invited testimony only .
tr	Def	The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom .
tr	Def	Walking out last night , Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets .
tr	Def	Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes .
tr	Def	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Def	As important , the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market .
tr	Def	This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting .
tr	Def	In the meantime , could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues ?
tr	Def	I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems .
tr	Def	I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston .
tr	Def	The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel .
tr	Def	I enjoyed your presentation , and meeting you briefly afterwards , at the SIAM Workshop last Friday .
tr	Def	Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline simulation industry would be a plus .
tr	Def	Also , please let me know , by email , the names and contact information of other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with my qualifications in their group .
tr	Def	What is the subject matter you wish to visit about ?
tr	Def	Please see the message from Danny Jones .

tr	Def	"We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include , "" a division of Cargill Incorporated ""."
tr	Def	We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty .
tr	Def	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Def	The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty ' s name from Global Counterparty .
tr	Def	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .
tr	Def	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
tr	Def	That is the source of Tana ' s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
tr	Def	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
tr	Def	In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .
tr	Def	I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and , if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure , please let me know .
tr	Def	Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill , Inc .
tr	Def	Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub - to - Legal Link to Cargill , Inc . per GCP procedure .
tr	Def	Also , the Global SAP team ( Cheryl Johnson ) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name .
tr	Def	Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name ?
tr	Def	Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Def	GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously .
tr	Def	( Although , we have broken that rule for Legal in the past .)
tr	Def	This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename .
tr	Def	Please review the process below :

tr	Def	Here is the overview of Bob Henderson ' s Employment Agreement .
tr	Def	Please see the attached .
tr	Def	Please send David Lund copies of our standard corporate services agreement and the standard assignment letter ( use Bridgeline example -- with and without non - compete ).
tr	Def	Here are the sample Agreements .
tr	Def	I agree also , but I don ' t know all the parties or complications involved .
tr	Def	I agree with what the concern is below .
tr	Def	Please let me know what type of statement I should make back to the customer .
tr	Def	Per my voicemail message , please review the note below .
tr	Def	I have the following suggestion for our company .
tr	Def	For example , I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number .
tr	Def	Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number .
tr	Def	The Leads who are responsible for Associates are as follows :
tr	Def	Peer reviews are currently been gathered on the above .
tr	Def	If anyone has any questions on the above please let me know .
tr	Def	This is the background to my conversation with Shanna .
tr	Def	John , Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions .
tr	Def	I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur .
tr	Def	We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth , Florida project as well .
tr	Def	Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work .
tr	Def	In that respect , we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team .
tr	Def	I think the first step is a call between yourself , me , Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero .
tr	Def	I have been advised by our Construction Manager , Mr . Joe Osler that while he was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired about permit requirements to picket our site .
tr	Def	Apparently the City informed them that no permit is required .
tr	Def	I have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today .
tr	Def	Thank you for the invitaion to the conference call .
tr	Def	, Do you want us to come over to the Enron b in your call .
tr	Def	The call was cancelled .
tr	Def	The draft you received has been approved by Dan .
tr	Def	Dan : please see if the attached draft works .
tr	Def	Can we reschedule the phone call for 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) on Friday , Sept . 17 ?
tr	Def	The conference call has been rescheduled for Friday , Sept . 17 at 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ).
tr	Def	I will initiate the call .
tr	Def	"Other "" guidelines "" exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia ."
tr	Def	Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US ( although LA . is about as close as you can get to a third world country ).
tr	Def	One thing that doesn ' t show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue .
tr	Def	Becky will bring you the hard copy version .
tr	Def	It looks like the 2 - day L / C issue is an issue .
tr	Def	Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original .
tr	Def	He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight .
tr	Def	S & S has again asked about the gtee and l / c wording .
tr	Def	They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes .
tr	Def	Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5 ) and the new l / c wording ( drops the 2 day period to replace an l / c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay ).
tr	Def	I know we talked about these issues earlier , but Tiger ' s lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing , even if we are the one ' s issuing the gtee and l / c .
tr	Def	As for me , well , I lead the simple life , own a little house in West University , own a little car ( I had to buy a new one recently - the 14 - year old 380 SE started scaring me a bit ), you know , the usual .
tr	Def	Are you selling burgers up and down the east coast ?
tr	Def	Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines ( physical and financial ) for the London traders .
tr	Def	I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions ( first Argentina ) and thought your expertise would be very helpful .
tr	Def	I ' m leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow .
tr	Def	( if .....) ( iii ) definitive agreements acceptable to Party A in its sole discretion regarding the debt and all other aspects of [ the project to be owned by Party B ], including but not limited to the senior debt facility , commitments and all project documents , have been fully negotiated and executed and the [ project ] has been brought to financial close .
tr	Def	Sara , here are the trader guidelines I developed for UK gas , UK power and Nordic power .

tr	Def	I ' m leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow .
tr	Def	Please review the attached memo to verify that I have identified all of the products that you are interested in trading in Brazil .
tr	Def	Parties , attached is the promised ruling that provides procedural guidance for the hearings on 12 / 27 and 12 / 28 .
tr	Def	The ruling will also be posted on the web site as quickly as possible .
tr	Def	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Def	* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ). *
tr	Def	The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *
tr	Def	* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .
tr	Def	PG & E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today ' s mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
tr	Def	The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal , an Attachment ( a copy of PG & E ' s proposed Gas Rule 27 ), and a set of supporting workpapers .
tr	Def	"Finally , please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in "" Word 2000 "" format ."
tr	Def	We would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of Word , upon request by individual Parties .
tr	Def	In the meantime , we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season .
tr	Def	Mike Day , our outside counsel , will make the presentation on our behalf .
tr	Def	Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will forward that along for folks review later today .
tr	Def	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Def	The call in number is 800 . 713 . 8600 .
tr	Def	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).

tr	Def	Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will forward that along for folks review later today .
tr	Def	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Def	The call in number is 800 . 713 . 8600 .
tr	Def	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).
tr	Def	I ' ll make the change .
tr	Def	Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .
tr	Def	We ' re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
tr	Def	But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .
tr	Def	"OBSERVATION -- The pressure to finger somebody for "" price gouging "" is increasing ."
tr	Def	"The administration is hell bent on finding a "" fall guy ."""
tr	Def	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
tr	Def	"His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "" refunds ."""
tr	Def	On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .
tr	Def	At the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked arms in calling for refunds .
tr	Def	"Bilbray joined the "" gouging "" band wagon ."
tr	Def	"The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "" real "" investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works ."
tr	Def	On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
tr	Def	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Def	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Def	"In the best case , the clamoring for a "" refund "" subsides ."
tr	Def	In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .
tr	Def	"In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) "" played by the rules ,"" but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers ."
tr	Def	Rates can ' t go up w / out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion --- trying to finesse it .
tr	Def	Thanks very much for the comments .
tr	Def	The Associate and Analyst Programs will be on the Penn , undergraduate campus interviewing summer Analyst interns next week .
tr	Def	Due to business reasons , previously scheduled interviewers from the Penn team have had to cancel their participation .
tr	Def	In the event that you have scheduling conflicts and cannot participate , any referrals at the Director or VP level would be greatly appreciated .
tr	Def	thanks for the update .
tr	Def	Tom Byargeon , Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana / Texas oil and gas drilling projects .
tr	Def	This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities .
tr	Def	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40 , 000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
tr	Def	Tom ' s group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis .
tr	Def	The floating could be tied to a Platt ' s index or the NYMEX .
tr	Def	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95 , 000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
tr	Def	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Def	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Def	even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .
tr	Def	the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back .
tr	Def	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Def	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .
tr	Def	I highlight the relevant skills in the summary .
tr	Def	The position is with the EES MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE , RETAIL & COMM , ENRON ENERGY SERVICES .
tr	Def	It was posted on Dec . 11 , but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet , it is open .
tr	Def	Any plans for the weekend ?
tr	Def	The mother was running late for work and could not wait .
tr	Def	I couldn ' t say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs . old ) and I waited for the bus .
tr	Def	Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8 : 30am ).
tr	Def	I stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
tr	Def	I told the bus driver where to drop her off .
tr	Def	I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure .
tr	Def	Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well .
tr	Def	Actually , Jen has volunteered for the afternoon session .
tr	Def	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
tr	Def	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Def	We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon .
tr	Def	We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9am - 12pm ) or afternoon ( 2pm - 5pm ) complete session .
tr	Def	Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date .
tr	Def	In addition , we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer .
tr	Def	Where does our 50 % ( the 1 . 65 million dollars ) show up ?
tr	Def	Marianne : The following are my comments :
tr	Def	"2 . In Section 3 . 1 , in the last sentence after the proviso insert "" a "" before the word "" change "" and after the word "" in ""."
tr	Def	4 . In Section 6 . 2 . 1 I ' ll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue .
tr	Def	5 . In Section 6 . 3 , clause ( c ) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section .
tr	Def	"6 . Capitalize the word "" facility "" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor ."
tr	Def	7 . Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6 . 2 . 1 .
tr	Def	8 . Where is the defined term Govt Authority used ?
tr	Def	9 . In the GTC , the ECP rep should also apply to EESI .
tr	Def	"Also , in the 7th line of the reps add the word "" into "" after the word "" entered "" and before the word "" this ""."
tr	Def	"In clause ( e ), delete the "" s "": from the word consolidation ."
tr	Def	I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .
tr	Def	Please note the following as you review :
tr	Def	1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer ' s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T & D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer ' s utility .
tr	Def	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Def	Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched .
tr	Def	I have faxed to you the form of Bond , our proposed Bond provisions and the EEI Master .
tr	Def	I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e - mail .
tr	Def	Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of the language that makes the LC transferable .
tr	Def	I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions .
tr	Def	How are you making out on the revised version of the LOC ?
tr	Def	In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form , I think you should add a forward contract rep .
tr	Def	Once we agree on the list , we can sign the EEI Master .
tr	Def	Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the version that you sent to me the current version ?
tr	Def	I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
tr	Def	I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we ' re all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
tr	Def	As far as the EEI goes , the only remaining issue that I ' m aware of ( aside from finalizing the LOC ) is whether we ' ve finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions .
tr	Def	We can accept the language with your chnages .
tr	Def	I am out of the office today but will be back tomorrow .
tr	Def	Our credit person doesn ' t understand why the transferability language needs to be eliminated .
tr	Def	It simply refers to the same ICC publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit generally .
tr	Def	Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
tr	Def	With respect to the Guaranty , I will delete the Schedule .
tr	Def	Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar .
tr	Def	Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect .
tr	Def	If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments , please give me a call .
tr	Def	Also , you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up , but to protect ourselves , we have added language in Para 3 . 2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax .
tr	Def	Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language .
tr	Def	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Def	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
tr	Def	If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts / materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events , please let me know .

tr	Def	The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use , I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps . to use for updates .
tr	Def	How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number ?
tr	Def	The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email .
tr	Def	The new Hotline phone number is 713 - 853 - 3044 .
tr	Def	I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation , TK was also made aware .

tr	Def	Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report .
tr	Def	The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $ 165 . 9m .
tr	Def	This difference is mainly due to the following :
tr	Def	Also , revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW ' s tariff rates were adjusted accordingly .
tr	Def	Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday .
tr	Def	If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and / or send me their resume .
tr	Def	The in - service date of May 1 , will be very difficult to attain .
tr	Def	Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ).
tr	Def	These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect .
tr	Def	Questar may be able to purchase material , but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery .
tr	Def	Not the usual mode of operations .
tr	Def	The I / C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100 % of design ).
tr	Def	We will try to complete the I / C with the earliest in - service date possible , but with conditions as they are , a realistic date would be June 15 , 2002 .
tr	Def	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Def	As you look at this , if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .

tr	Def	My concern is that between now and then Dunn , the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief , which could be detrimental to generators / marketers ' claims .
tr	Def	Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators -- asking about haircuts in particular -- and Edison is side - stepping the questions .
tr	Def	You know when the meeting with schedulers will be ?
tr	Def	I apologize , I ' m on the road and haven ' t heard when that will be .
tr	Def	Thanks for the info - a few people from our shop will be in attendance ./
tr	Def	I ' ll get you the announcement .
tr	Def	Probing the ' palace coup '
tr	Def	The Orange County Register
tr	Def	"The investigative committee , headed by state Sen . Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : "" the palace coup ."""
tr	Def	Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state ' s energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis , pushed the state into the power - buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers .
tr	Def	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Def	The subpoenas will force those involved , including Winter , to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee , and to turn over e - mails , personal calendars and memos .
tr	Def	"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter ."
tr	Def	""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis ,"" Maviglio said ."
tr	Def	Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .
tr	Def	The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the lights on .
tr	Def	At the time , generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps .
tr	Def	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct . 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .
tr	Def	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .
tr	Def	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Def	Records show that on Oct . 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .
tr	Def	The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators .
tr	Def	""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity ,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III ."
tr	Def	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .
tr	Def	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Def	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Def	The generators got their way .
tr	Def	The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .
tr	Def	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Def	What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .
tr	Def	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Def	Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .
tr	Def	Neither the ISO board , which had established the price cap , nor the governor learned of Winter ' s actions until the cap had been removed .
tr	Def	In fact , the attorney who helped draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made .
tr	Def	With the price caps gone , the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs .
tr	Def	""" The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor ' s key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment ,'' Maviglio said ."
tr	Def	"This action accelerated the utilities ' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power - buying business ."""
tr	Def	Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $ 30 billion .
tr	Def	Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians .
tr	Def	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .
tr	Def	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .
tr	Def	""" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Def	""" In our view , we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation ."
tr	Def	Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .
tr	Def	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Def	""" Terry did this by himself ,'' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
tr	Def	""" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing ."""
tr	Def	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Def	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed , but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos , the governor ' s spokesman Maviglio said .
tr	Def	James J . Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter .
tr	Def	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Def	""" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact .''"
tr	Def	We should resurrect Mike Smith ' s note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one .
tr	Def	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .
tr	Def	I ' ll leave to Steve to structure the deal .
tr	Def	And if yes , what ' s the game and wager ???
tr	Def	Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them .
tr	Def	"Where is the "" simple "" explanation of the transportation piece ?"
tr	Def	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Def	Accordingly , the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP ( the only one and therefore the one they have to choose ) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract .
tr	Def	By Friday December 1st , could you please tell me the percentages / amount of time you spent on East Coast Power during the months of October and November .
tr	Def	In addition , could you look over the list below to see if there are any additional employees in your group that spent time on ECP , so we can ensure we bill all of our used resources to ECP .
tr	Def	*** Mary Perkins - Could you forward the number of transactions and accounts .
tr	Def	*** Jason Chumley - Could you forward the number of contractor hours and help / remote support hours .
tr	Def	In the three years I have been here , I am unaware of an ENA / ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company .
tr	Def	I ' ve read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations appropriately .
tr	Def	I guess the questions on which I should like your steer are : ( a ) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference to bad faith proceedings made by United India ?
tr	Def	( c ) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you ?
tr	Def	Not when I was there , but I wasn ' t there the whole time .
tr	Def	"were you able to discuss the "" bad faith "" proceedings issue yesterday ?"

tr	Def	the industry of Marriage and Kids , you heard me .
tr	Def	Look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating , yet they do .
tr	Def	These are the people who keep Jerry springer on the air .
tr	Def	These are the kids who will destroy society , because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture , you heard again .
tr	Def	And you might think by reading this I blame the kids .....
tr	Def	It ' s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
tr	Def	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .
tr	Def	Just because you ' re stuck , doesnt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you .

tr	Def	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Def	"Now , NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with "" go "" fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches ."
tr	Def	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
tr	Def	"Seeing another "" Columbia "" incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas )."
tr	Def	We don ' t need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species .
tr	Def	Maybe one day they will allow space tourism , ( hopefully that will be in the near future ) although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones .
tr	Def	"You do have to give NASA credit on some things as they have eliminated the "" fear of reporting failure "" culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the Columbia shuttle ."
tr	Def	Clearly , the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel .
tr	Def	"The other is a new fuel tank "" guaranteed "" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation ."
tr	Def	NASA has some PR hurdles to overcome in the future .
tr	Def	But lets hope for their sake ( and the sake of all space lovers out there ) that they can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again .
tr	Def	Healing the Collective Body
tr	Def	I see the merit in flowing with duality .
tr	Def	One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one , that there is no separation between you and I , we are all together in this thing called life , we human beings , the birds and the tress , the rocks and the sky , all of it .
tr	Def	Any insult to the collective good brings us all down .
tr	Def	Living out of synch with nature is the great disease , from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness .
tr	Def	We are only as strong as our weakest , we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager .
tr	Def	When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down .
tr	Def	There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
tr	Def	We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment , our rejection of the natural for the industrial , and our embrace of violence over peace .
tr	Def	Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him .
tr	Def	What are you doing to the least of the people ?
tr	Def	In the near future collective choices will need to be made .
tr	Def	Freedom from the fear of corporate downsizing ?

tr	Def	The Dance
tr	Def	The eighteen steps of the dance are done rhythmically .
tr	Def	First the dancer begins in the starting position : the hands together and raised over the head .
tr	Def	"Then to the beat of "" dhin , dhin ,... , ta ', ta '"", the dancers begin their step , placing the big toe behind the heel of the other foot ."
tr	Def	In the final two steps , the dancers firmly stamp their feet on the ground .
tr	Def	The Ideation
tr	Def	"When the dancers start the step with the beat of "" dhin , dhin ..."", the mental ideation should also be kept ."
tr	Def	Here is the ideation .
tr	Def	"The two hands when upraised and folded together represent : "" Now I am trying to establish a link with Parama Purus ' a ( Supreme Consciousness )."""
tr	Def	"Bending to the right indicates : "" I know the right way to request You ."""
tr	Def	"Bending to the left indicates : "" I know how to fulfil Your demands ."""
tr	Def	"The last two steps represent : "" O Lord I repeat Your cosmic rhythm ."""
tr	Def	""" All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [ River ] valley where we were canoeing ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Def	The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears .
tr	Def	The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack , experts said .
tr	Def	The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
tr	Def	The bear dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 Mr . Parenteau , knocking him to the ground , he said .
tr	Def	Again Dr . Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
tr	Def	""" The bear gave chase and I gave chase ,"" he said ."
tr	Def	""" At some point , Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back ."
tr	Def	"I was beside the bear ' s head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times ."""
tr	Def	The bear ran off .
tr	Def	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Def	Dr . Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
tr	Def	Dr . Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement .
tr	Def	Dr . Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday .
tr	Def	"The bronze medal is given to people who "" risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others ."""
tr	Def	The other Canadian recipient of the medal was Ronald Joseph Crawford , 42 , of Hamilton , who was killed Aug . 4 , 2002 , while trying to defend a Hamilton sandwich shop owner from a robber wielding a knife .
tr	Def	Mr . Crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .
tr	Def	The award comes with a $ 3 , 500 ( U . S .) grant .
tr	Def	It was the favorite fruit of founder Steve Jobs .
tr	Def	The name was derived from the founder ' s name Dr . Michael Cowpland .
tr	Def	The name started as a joke boasting about the amount of information the search - engine would be able to search .
tr	Def	Founder Jack Smith got the idea of accessing e - mail via the web from a computer anywhere in the world .
tr	Def	"When Sabeer Bhatia came up with the business plan for the mail service , he tried all kinds of names ending in ' mail ' and finally settled for hotmail as it included the letters "" html "" - the programming language used to write web pages ."
tr	Def	Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from ' The Lotus Position ' or ' Padmasana '.
tr	Def	Coined by Bill Gates to represent the company that was devoted to MICROcomputer SOFTware .
tr	Def	Originally christened Micro - Soft , the '-' was removed later on .
tr	Def	The popular radio company at the time was called Victrola .
tr	Def	The code name for the project was called Oracle ( the CIA saw this as the system to give answers to all questions or something such ).
tr	Def	The project was designed to help use the newly written SQL code by IBM .
tr	Def	The project eventually was terminated but Larry and Bob decided to finish what they started and bring it to the world .
tr	Def	They kept the name Oracle and created the RDBMS engine .
tr	Def	Later they kept the same name for the company .
tr	Def	It originated from the Latin word ' sonus ' meaning sound , and ' sonny ' a slang used by Americans to refer to a bright youngster .
tr	Def	Founded by 4 Stanford University buddies , SUN is the acronym for Stanford University Network .
tr	Def	The word was invented by Jonathan Swift and used in his book ' Gulliver ' s Travels '.
tr	Def	Yahoo ! Founders Jerry Yang and DavidFilo selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos ...
tr	Def	There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing Guild Wars , so why create a new one ?
tr	Def	The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it ' s not going to go away .

tr	Def	That said , the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :).

tr	Def	I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH , son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush , and currently serving as President of the United States of America .
tr	Def	I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
tr	Def	In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my father , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran .
tr	Def	My father re - secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U . S . dollars ($ 61 , 000 , 000 , 000 ).
tr	Def	But my father ' s former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
tr	Def	My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
tr	Def	Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($ 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 ), both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
tr	Def	Without the funds from our 1991 partners , we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq .
tr	Def	Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice - president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
tr	Def	The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary .
tr	Def	I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
tr	Def	But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day .
tr	Def	If you do not wish to co - operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter .
tr	Def	Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below .

tr	Def	Walls keeping water out of the bowl - shaped city have been breached , and emergency teams are using helicopters to drop 1 , 350kg ( 3 , 000lb ) sandbags and concrete barriers into the gaps .

tr	Def	New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin said up to 80 % of the city was submerged , in some cases by waters 6m ( 20ft ) deep .
tr	Def	""" Some sections of the city which are dry now could see nine or 10 feet ( some 3m ) of water ,"" he said ."
tr	Def	The US Army Corps of Engineers says it could take a month to clear the flood waters , and the government ' s disaster relief agency has urged evacuees not to try to get back to their homes .
tr	Def	The BBC ' s Alastair Leithead in New Orleans says there is panic as vital supplies run out .
tr	Def	The situation appears to be even worse in Mississippi .

tr	Def	How much money does the USA give NASA per year ?
tr	Def	On September 21 , 2004 , the U . S . Senate Appropriations Committee approved $ 16 . 379 billion in funding for NASA for fiscal year 2005 .
tr	Def	-- The return to flight activities for the Shuttle program are funded at $ 4 . 319 billion , the requested level from the Administration .
tr	Def	-- The International Space Station is funded at $ 1 . 6 billion .

tr	Def	"Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation ( NRC ): is funded at $ 115 million , the same as FY04 and the budget request ."""

tr	Def	"The committee voted to give NASA $ 16 . 4 billion in 2005 , about $ 200 million more than what the President requested and over $ 1 billion more than what House appropriators approved in July ."""
tr	Def	If you have any questions , please request clarification prior to rating the answer .
tr	Def	I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .

tr	Def	China ' s insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
tr	Def	The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .
tr	Def	"The submarine incident was put down to a "" technical error "" by the Chinese government , which apologised to Japan ."
tr	Def	"But even before the incident the People ' s Daily , the government mouthpiece , had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "" only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy ""."
tr	Def	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .
tr	Def	The West , however , has paid little attention to these developments .
tr	Def	"For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China ' s relations with "" pariah states ""."
tr	Def	In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur .
tr	Def	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .
tr	Def	Then , this month , it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran ' s nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
tr	Def	This year it overtook Japan as the world ' s second largest consumer of energy , behind the US .
tr	Def	Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities .
tr	Def	"Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to "" go abroad "" to ensure supply , they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border ."
tr	Def	Japan protested , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .
tr	Def	The two are also set to clash over Russia ' s oil wealth .
tr	Def	China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East .
tr	Def	Claude Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly worth the trouble .
tr	Def	""" If China ' s economy falters , which , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity prices will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets that produce them ,"" Jason Kindopp , Eurasia ' s lead China analyst , said ."
tr	Def	China ' s wider aggression to secure oil and gas was the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade .
tr	Def	""" Sudan is the primary example ,"" he said ."
tr	Def	""" It marks the first time in recent years that China has promised to wield its veto power in the UN Security Council against a petition initiated by the United States and backed by France and Great Britain ."""

tr	Def	You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you .
tr	Def	Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
tr	Def	And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ).
tr	Def	Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .
tr	Def	Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
tr	Def	The sun ' s rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .
tr	Def	Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .
tr	Def	You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
tr	Def	This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .
tr	Def	Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
tr	Def	Feel that you ' re sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
tr	Def	Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
tr	Def	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Def	Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you ' re repeating it .
tr	Def	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Def	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
tr	Def	The important point is to develop some psycho - spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
tr	Def	Don ' t worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that ' s normal .
tr	Def	It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
tr	Def	The main thing is to keep practicing .
tr	Def	From what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage .
tr	Def	But that ’ s not the case .
tr	Def	One of “ NCRC4ME ’ s ” major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached “ Declaration of Religious Leaders ,” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature .
tr	Def	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Def	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .
tr	Def	Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration .
tr	Def	Furthermore , the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration .
tr	Def	( Since the Declaration is written as coming from “ religious leaders ,” people who don ’ t consider themselves “ religious leaders ” can sign as “ Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality .”)
tr	Def	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
tr	Def	If you have any questions please feel free to call me ( after Sat . the 26th , when I will return from a trip ).
tr	Def	Sign - up lists will be available at the services on Feb . 27 and March 6 , or you can email me .
tr	Def	For the Church of the Holy Spirit Vestry ,
tr	Def	The most fundamental human right , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings .
tr	Def	"The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “ inalienable rights ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness ."""
tr	Def	Throughout history , tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families , they can kill the spirit of those peoples .
tr	Def	> From the shameful history of slavery in America , the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right .
tr	Def	The American laws forbidding interracial marriage , now struck down , were clearly discriminatory .
tr	Def	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Def	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
tr	Def	As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
tr	Def	We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
tr	Def	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
tr	Def	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .
tr	Def	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Def	The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law .
tr	Def	As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
tr	Def	The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
tr	Def	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
tr	Def	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Def	Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :
tr	Def	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Def	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Def	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan . 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
tr	Def	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Def	""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President ."""
tr	Def	In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
tr	Def	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
tr	Def	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .
tr	Def	""" Commander In Chief "" doesn ' t mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
tr	Def	Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .
tr	Def	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
tr	Def	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Def	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .
tr	Def	AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .
tr	Def	"Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA & Company to use "" freeze thawed "" strategy especially when the country has a challenging , growing and ambitious space program ."
tr	Def	"Dependant = NASA & Company to use "" space station "" model to unify the aims of different countries ."
tr	Def	The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries .
tr	Def	Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program ' s goals
tr	Def	The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China ' s official news agency .
tr	Def	The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
tr	Def	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Def	But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
tr	Def	President Bush has directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers .
tr	Def	China ' s overtures to join the U . S .- led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country ' s human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat .
tr	Def	The freeze thawed some after Yang ' s 2003 mission .
tr	Def	At present , there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel said .
tr	Def	The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese said .
tr	Def	The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi - compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
tr	Def	The Chinese program ' s second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques .
tr	Def	The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
tr	Def	""" The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly ,"" said John E . Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va .- based GlobalSecurity . org , a small national security think tank ."
tr	Def	""" There is always the possibility they could jam us up , make us look like we are not numero uno ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Def	During the U . S . and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays .
tr	Def	As it turned out , the Soviets never made it to the moon .
tr	Def	"""( China ) could be the second country to do that ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Def	""" They would get in line in front of the Russians ."
tr	Def	"And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch ."""
tr	Def	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .
tr	Def	"The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their "" product "" as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love ."
tr	Def	Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
tr	Def	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Def	Right now , while we ' re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
tr	Def	The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust .
tr	Def	Here ' s the text of the email :
tr	Def	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Def	"Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats "" Meowing ,"" I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture ."
tr	Def	I ' ve pasted the email for those who haven ' t seen or would like to re - read it .
tr	Def	It ' s also got the website where the song has been uploaded .
tr	Def	"This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
tr	Def	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Def	"The quote is from an article entitled "" Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem '"""
tr	Def	If anyone wants the complete article , email me , as it is a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy .
tr	Def	Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds , where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires .
tr	Def	These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume .

tr	Def	Within seven days , I started getting money in the mail !!
tr	Def	I figured it would end soon , but the money just kept coming in .
tr	Def	By the end of the second week I had made a total of more than $ 1000 . 00 !!
tr	Def	In the third week I had more than $ 10 , 000 . 00 and it ' s still growing !!
tr	Def	It ' s certainly worth $ 6 . 00 and six stamps , and I have spent more than that on the lottery without ever winning !!!
tr	Def	also make sure you print this out NOW , so you can get the information off of it , as you will need it .
tr	Def	I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy !!
tr	Def	Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in !!
tr	Def	If all the following instructions are adhered to , you will receive extraordinary dividends .
tr	Def	Please follow the directions EXACTLY , and $ 50 , 000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days .
tr	Def	This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants .
tr	Def	Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions .
tr	Def	You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists .
tr	Def	However , the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list .
tr	Def	Here are the four easy steps to success .
tr	Def	"Get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "" PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST ."""
tr	Def	Now get 6 U . S . $ 1 . 00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope ( to prevent thievery ).
tr	Def	Next , place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them .
tr	Def	So I checked it out with the U . S . Post Office ( 1 - 800 - 238 - 5355 ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal !!
tr	Def	Mail the six envelopes to the following addresses :
tr	Def	STEP TWO : Now take the # 1 name off the list that you see above , move the other names up ( six becomes 5 , 5 becomes 4 , and etc .) and add YOUR NAME as number 6 on the list .
tr	Def	All you need is 200 , but remember , the more you post , the more money you make !!
tr	Def	If you have any doubts , refer to Title 18 Sec . 1302 & 1341 of the Postal Lottery laws .
tr	Def	PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to directions .
tr	Def	If you were of integrity , the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way .
tr	Def	So , as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed , all members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each .
tr	Def	Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the # 1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH !!!
tr	Def	Send it now , add your own name to the list and you ' re in business !!!
tr	Def	Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document , and select ' copy ' from the edit menu .
tr	Def	This will copy the entire letter into the computer ' s memory .
tr	Def	From the ' edit ' menu select ' paste '.

tr	Def	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Def	In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan ' s Lake Superior .
tr	Def	The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
tr	Def	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Def	After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .
tr	Def	In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .
tr	Def	If true , the caper failed .
tr	Def	Over time , the wolf ' s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
tr	Def	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Def	"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf ' s relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
tr	Def	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
tr	Def	Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
tr	Def	""" All you have to do is look at the photographs ,"" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI ' s Blue Planet ,"
tr	Def	Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park ' s northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .
tr	Def	It ' s important with regard to the quality of streams .
tr	Def	The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability .
tr	Def	Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
tr	Def	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal ' s status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
tr	Def	Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .
tr	Def	Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .
tr	Def	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf ' s status .
tr	Def	Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
tr	Def	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Def	There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31 , 000 mountain lions .
tr	Def	They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
tr	Def	Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .
tr	Def	It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
tr	Def	Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?
tr	Def	True , there are about 300 , 000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .
tr	Def	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Def	Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .
tr	Def	Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends , but meanwhile Earth ' s plants , insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome .
tr	Def	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non - human natural world to changing conditions , and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming .
tr	Def	Bradley ' s record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999 , spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data .
tr	Def	Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier .
tr	Def	The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to .
tr	Def	The forest phlox is blooming in late April instead of mid - May .
tr	Def	Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming .
tr	Def	In England , the cuckoo returns earlier .
tr	Def	""" One of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities ,"" concluded a report titled "" Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States ,"" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week ."
tr	Def	""" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change ,"" said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world ' s leading experts on this issue ."
tr	Def	""" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding ,"" she said ."
tr	Def	Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .
tr	Def	""" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable ."""
tr	Def	"Throughout the United States , she said , "" spring is about two weeks earlier ."
tr	Def	Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .
tr	Def	"Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many , many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean ."""
tr	Def	"As the Pew report concluded , "" Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U . S . ecosystems ."""
tr	Def	The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .
tr	Def	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""
tr	Def	"The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "" Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ."""
tr	Def	The ACIA -- with participation by the United States , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000 .
tr	Def	""" The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic ,"" said ACIA chair Robert Corell ."
tr	Def	""" The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth ."
tr	Def	"The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come ."""
tr	Def	The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years .
tr	Def	Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the assessment found , with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice .
tr	Def	""" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction ,"" the report concluded ."
tr	Def	"On the one hand , the IPN report agreed "" Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise ."
tr	Def	"This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase ."""
tr	Def	On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .
tr	Def	""" The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge ,"" the IPN report said ."
tr	Def	The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster .
tr	Def	Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate .
tr	Def	The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non - commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .
tr	Def	The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears , checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables .
tr	Def	The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument .
tr	Def	This tug - of - war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans , because animals and plants can adjust only so much .

tr	Def	Preamble from BBC leading to the comments further below .
tr	Def	Feel free to cut and paste and leave your comments , as these viewpoints cover the entire gamut surrounding the event .
tr	Def	How has Katrina changed the US ?
tr	Def	What will be the lasting effects of Hurricane Katrina and what can be learnt from the response ?
tr	Def	In the world press , commentators predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad , especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed .
tr	Def	How has Katrina changed the US ?
tr	Def	Has the disaster affected the way other countries view the US ?
tr	Def	Send us your comments using the form .
tr	Def	Some of the better comments :
tr	Def	You have seen the pictures .
tr	Def	"It is the welfare society that was New Orleans ."""
tr	Def	""" I am frankly revolted by the response of the Bush - Bashers ; "" Sorry chaps , but you did have it coming ..."""
tr	Def	The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors .
tr	Def	""" I do not feel it has changed the US citizens which is what was needed , even now the majority want "" Gas "" despite the fact they are polluting the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop , perhaps this natural disaster , which let ' s face it looks like a product of Global Warming , will change their views , why not pick things up with your hands and walk with your legs , other people in the world do it , "" Gas "" is not the be all and end all !"""
tr	Def	< This man has clearly never visited the US .
tr	Def	Distances are not what they are in the old world .
tr	Def	""" The US will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making progress after seven short days ."
tr	Def	It is always interesting what spin the press will take .
tr	Def	Certainly , representation of the US in other countries will have a certain depiction .
tr	Def	I don ' t believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news .
tr	Def	Yes , she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country .
tr	Def	The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations .
tr	Def	Now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue ...
tr	Def	You know , I ' ve lived in the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life .
tr	Def	The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
tr	Def	Additionally , reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes , you ' ll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states .
tr	Def	However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
tr	Def	I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
tr	Def	I do know that this will change the face of America .
tr	Def	I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
tr	Def	The 1 . 25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin to populate Houston , Dallas , San Antonio and Galveston , and the surrounding areas .
tr	Def	Or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives ?
tr	Def	Will the housing market in Dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx of buyers ?
tr	Def	What will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market ?
tr	Def	These are some of the things I ' ve been wondering ...
tr	Def	I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what ' s the point ?
tr	Def	My friend didn ' t have computer capability , so I spent the day searching and posting online .
tr	Def	The family here ( California ) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA , so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there .
tr	Def	The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names .
tr	Def	The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available .
tr	Def	What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he didn ' t order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
tr	Def	Recently , Bush addressed the nation .
tr	Def	About 30 seconds into his address , he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time .
tr	Def	Meanwhile , every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again .
tr	Def	The gall of it all is that Bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries , when what he should do is pour money into making the US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together .
tr	Def	"We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "" FREEDOM "" why not spend those billions making all of us free ?"

tr	Def	The Rock revolution happened in the Sixties ( 6 , number of the Beast ).

tr	Def	The Rock revolution came from the nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addicts , homosexuals and lunatics ( as that of George Martin , ally of the Beatles ).
tr	Def	It came from the nation whose king Enrique VIII adulterated the Bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom God provided a wife with six fingers as abomination ( Anne Boleyn )... once again 6 , number of the Beast ....
tr	Def	"It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "" the Devil ' s Island ""."

tr	Def	The antichrist John Lennon , one of the Devil ' s main puppets to destroy family , social and moral values and to begin the disintegration of mankind , did hit Stuart Sutcliffe ( the first bass player of the Beatles ) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg .
tr	Def	"The same demons that made captain Smith say "" Not even God can sink my ship "" spoke from antichrist John Lennon ( from Liverpool , base port to the Titanic ) saying : "" Christianity is on the go ."
tr	Def	That was the day that GOD ' S CURSE fell upon the world of Rock .
tr	Def	One week after that declaration , ONLY ONE WEEK LATER , Brian Epstein , forger of the Beatle farce , died from an overdose .
tr	Def	From then on , the Beatles began to get involved in false religions and to preach them to the world .
tr	Def	"John Lennon ' s divorce followed , as well as his entering the world of black magic , as deeply as to buy the apartment . where the "" Rosemary ' s baby "" had been filmed , previous property of Roman Polansky , and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations ."
tr	Def	"Came the disintegration of the Beatles ' minds with LSD which has caused , among others , schizophrenic lyrics such as "" I am the Walrus "" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "" Revolution number 9 ""."

tr	Def	"It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : "" I ' ve got a feeling , a feeling I can ' t hide ..."" in front of Yoko in the film ."
tr	Def	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Def	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."
tr	Def	The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism .
tr	Def	One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono .
tr	Def	That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be .
tr	Def	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Def	"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" they advise black Joe to "" get back to where you once belonged "", as if England was not a place for black people ."
tr	Def	Sometimes back , Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles .
tr	Def	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .

tr	Def	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Def	It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him .
tr	Def	Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other .
tr	Def	"The Beatles of the times of the "" Cavern "" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin ."

tr	Def	"After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "" Devil ' s Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc ., etc .,"
tr	Def	The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve , was because the forces of Satan were behind everything , supporting the process .
tr	Def	This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil ' s Island .

tr	Def	The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi ' ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ).
tr	Def	Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi ' ite leadership in Iran that go back decades .
tr	Def	Should the United States undertake military action against Iran , the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme .
tr	Def	In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .
tr	Def	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
tr	Def	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Def	The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases , and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power .
tr	Def	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Def	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Def	""" Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability ,"" continued the CSIS report ."
tr	Def	""" Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional threat of proliferation ."
tr	Def	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Def	The so called ' Tanker ' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region .
tr	Def	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Def	""" More concerning ,"" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy ."
tr	Def	"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect , anti - shipping cruise missiles : ' Iran has obtained new anti - ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines .'"""
tr	Def	It is Iran ' s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .
tr	Def	Iran ' s coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters .
tr	Def	The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .
tr	Def	In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf .
tr	Def	Of all the missiles in Iran ' s armament , the most dangerous is the Russian - made SS - N - 22 Sunburn .
tr	Def	These missiles are , simply , the fastest anti - ship weapons on the planet .
tr	Def	The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude .
tr	Def	Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2 . 2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .
tr	Def	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .
tr	Def	The missile ' s manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer , and five missiles could sink a 20 , 000 ton ship .
tr	Def	The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile .
tr	Def	Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 sailors .
tr	Def	The Stark could not see them to stop them .
tr	Def	The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf , with some 7 , 000 souls aboard .
tr	Def	Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force , which includes the USS Tarawa , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor .
tr	Def	The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf .
tr	Def	The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .
tr	Def	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
tr	Def	Currently , the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs .
tr	Def	The vaunted American military has suffered 2 , 210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare .
tr	Def	The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war , a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days .
tr	Def	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23 , 000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
tr	Def	3 . The Syrian Connection
tr	Def	Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
tr	Def	The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft .
tr	Def	Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region , comprised primarily of SCUD - derived systems .
tr	Def	Iran , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies .
tr	Def	Compounding this is the well - based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf .
tr	Def	4 . China and the US Economy
tr	Def	While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .
tr	Def	In the last several months , China has inked deals with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas .
tr	Def	China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran , and will receive 150 , 000 barrels of oil per day from that field .
tr	Def	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .
tr	Def	Further , any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China ' s liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz .
tr	Def	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .
tr	Def	"Paul Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $ 1 trillion ."
tr	Def	These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States .
tr	Def	By dumping some portion of their reserves , these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U . S . interest rates skyrocketing .
tr	Def	China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .
tr	Def	""" The hardest blow on Americans ,"" concluded Roberts , "" will fall when China does revalue its currency ."
tr	Def	When China ' s currency ceases to be undervalued , American shoppers in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think they are in Neiman Marcus .
tr	Def	In short , China has the American economy by the throat .
tr	Def	China ' s strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States .
tr	Def	The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception .
tr	Def	The last three years of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this confidence .
tr	Def	Worse , the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military , justifying the decrease in confidence .
tr	Def	Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point .
tr	Def	According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E . Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration .
tr	Def	Add to this the economic threat posed by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe .
tr	Def	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .
tr	Def	Iran ' s position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair .
tr	Def	In the worst - case scenario , the newly - minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play , hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam .
tr	Def	The question must be put as directly as possible : what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe ?
tr	Def	Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat .
tr	Def	Therefore , any attack upon Iran ' s nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess .
tr	Def	Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe .
tr	Def	"The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Def	Unfortunately , all the dangers in the world are no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encased zealot .
tr	Def	George W . Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front .
tr	Def	Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media .
tr	Def	"Karl Rove , Bush ' s most senior advisor , notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war ."""
tr	Def	The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election .
tr	Def	The answer lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
tr	Def	The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP gains in Congress , and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away .
tr	Def	All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .

tr	Def	Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for . .
tr	Def	You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
tr	Def	Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
tr	Def	"Sometimes the "" cheap "" comes expensive !"
tr	Def	The cheapest * high quality * plastic surgeons are at Yanhee Hospitals .
tr	Def	Check the link for a sampling of prices .
tr	Def	my Tom cat will not eat meat just the juice in the can .?
tr	Def	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Def	They have done very well and like the dry food better .
tr	Def	Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you ' re paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
tr	Def	Read the labels for contents .
tr	Def	He might be sick take him to the vet to see
tr	Def	If he always does this , welcome to the club .
tr	Def	My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver ( cooked ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest .
tr	Def	YOU have to spend the time training .
tr	Def	Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
tr	Def	Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched .
tr	Def	I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size .
tr	Def	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Def	The piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box .
tr	Def	On the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank .
tr	Def	If you ' re going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank , getting a protein skimmer wouldn ' t be a bad idea .
tr	Def	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Def	From what I understand they ' re pretty much the same thing .
tr	Def	Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
tr	Def	Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color ?
tr	Def	Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that ' s not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
tr	Def	Or just purchase the Color ?
tr	Def	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Def	When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
tr	Def	So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
tr	Def	I ' m looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to ' s .
tr	Def	Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
tr	Def	It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
tr	Def	If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you won ' t regret it :)
tr	Def	When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that is floating on top .
tr	Def	You add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
tr	Def	Start up your filter ( sponge filters are the best for bettas ) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
tr	Def	Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
tr	Def	ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up , they would know
tr	Def	Add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
tr	Def	Make sure the temperature is good .
tr	Def	Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank .
tr	Def	I see youre still recovering from the accident .
tr	Def	While they are extremely accurate , laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target .
tr	Def	Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip .
tr	Def	Laser grips are the most common for wangs .
tr	Def	The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on .
tr	Def	Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip .
tr	Def	Prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang .
tr	Def	You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang .
tr	Def	Flip the switch and adjust your laser sight according to the directions in the owner manual that comes with the laser sight .
tr	Def	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Def	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Def	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Def	She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
tr	Def	What is the problem ?
tr	Def	I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he / she sleeps .
tr	Def	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Def	When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can ' t produce milk .
tr	Def	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Def	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Def	Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby .
tr	Def	Ignore the answer above me , btw ! ^ _ ^
tr	Def	Can I text from Canada to the united states ?
tr	Def	Ok maybe that isn ' t the right question , but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada , can you send texts to another united states number ?
tr	Def	Im sorry if I couldn ' t say the question right .
tr	Def	The only way to know for sure is to call 611 , or your cell phone help line , and ask .
tr	Def	The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it wouldn ' t work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
tr	Def	Ye $ you can Text in CANADA to the U $ on a U $ number .
tr	Def	"Hope you unde $ tood the me $$ age I do have an "" S "" key on my computer ."
tr	Def	As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now .
tr	Def	Why , how can i build up realtion ship with him he is also not useing the thing that he runs on and he wakes up walks around and goes to sleep again ???
tr	Def	Secondly , that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night .
tr	Def	Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
tr	Def	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Def	... Fishing , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things you can do for fun .
tr	Def	Don ' t know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn ' t want to end up like them !
tr	Def	Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year .
tr	Def	Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works .
tr	Def	Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
tr	Def	I don ' t know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don ' t see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
tr	Def	What is the typical lifespan of a cat ?
tr	Def	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Def	from my experience with my cats 13 - 18 years depending on the breed .
tr	Def	Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I ' ve ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional .
tr	Def	Patience is the key . =)
tr	Def	like my dogs , they really like me and trust me , but when I open the door to get them outside , they run from me , they know I ' m going to take them outside and they don ' t like it .
tr	Def	the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage , and birds don ' t usually like cages .
tr	Def	so , I don ' t think the bird don ' t trust you , but still don ' t like the cage .
tr	Def	I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit .
tr	Def	And I need to know where to buy the materials .
tr	Def	Almost every day he ' d even wake me up like 5am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
tr	Def	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Def	He ' d just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
tr	Def	lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , hes also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
tr	Def	( Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover ) Which of these two cages is better :
tr	Def	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
tr	Def	Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
tr	Def	If you use this cage it ' s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
tr	Def	The First One Is much Better !
tr	Def	I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
tr	Def	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Def	i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
tr	Def	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Def	from my understanding , if its heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
tr	Def	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Def	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
tr	Def	on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
tr	Def	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
tr	Def	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
tr	Def	Oh and btw I live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^ _ ^
tr	Def	"I would strongly suggest "" The Breakfast Club "" in Chicago ."
tr	Def	The Breakfast Club & Grill is conveniently located just two blocks off the Kennedy Expressway .
tr	Def	There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot .
tr	Def	Plenty of parking on the weekends .. during the week please park in the little lot across the street .
tr	Def	Directions from the Kennedy : Take the Ogden Exit off the Kennedy .
tr	Def	We ' re at the corner of Hubbard and Noble .

tr	Def	Unless you plan on being late for the bridal shower you might want to post this again in the L . A . section .
tr	Def	Question about the sinking of the Titanic ?
tr	Def	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Def	Sorry , I ' m just very nervous after watching the movie .
tr	Def	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Def	Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock .
tr	Def	We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .
tr	Def	Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
tr	Def	This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
tr	Def	When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
tr	Def	Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
tr	Def	How is the night life in Naha ?
tr	Def	The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
tr	Def	Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
tr	Def	The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
tr	Def	There ' s the market in Naha , which is great .
tr	Def	Try the local sake too if you can .
tr	Def	1 ) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16 ?
tr	Def	To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
tr	Def	He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
tr	Def	Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it wasn ' t .
tr	Def	Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
tr	Def	The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
tr	Def	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Def	Are the hotels back up and running ?
tr	Def	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Def	I ' m assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , don ' t worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
tr	Def	As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the don ' t do any damage .
tr	Def	However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and hasn ' t been cleared away yet .
tr	Def	I ' m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
tr	Def	Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
tr	Def	But I would go for the base number of 15hh .
tr	Def	Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
tr	Def	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Def	Where in the world is Iguazu ?
tr	Def	Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area .
tr	Def	The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘ Garganta Del Diablo ’ ( The Devil ’ s Throat ), where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air .
tr	Def	With the sun shinning down on the spray , creating a rainbow in the foreground , this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
tr	Def	However , save some of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River .
tr	Def	The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
tr	Def	The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil , which is equally close .
tr	Def	Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
tr	Def	The bus is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours , although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats .
tr	Def	The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
tr	Def	Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .
tr	Def	I am going to try and study aboard but idk where I can go I cannot decide where do you think would be the best place to go ?
tr	Def	you speak the language and will have more fun .
tr	Def	The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
tr	Def	As you ' re from the States you ' ll have much more fun in London .
tr	Def	Nobody likes the Parisians , even then Parisians don ' t like Parisians .
tr	Def	South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
tr	Def	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Def	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Def	Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
tr	Def	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
tr	Def	does the bta have to be paid first to come to canada ?
tr	Def	""" Second only to flight money , the Basic Travel Allowance ( BTA ) is the scammers highest paying income ."
tr	Def	Also known as the Personal Travel Allowance , Travellers Allowance Fee , Travellers Assistance Fund , Travellers Assurance Fund and numerous other forms of “ I have to have wodges of your cash or they won ’ t let me fly ”.
tr	Def	There is NO such requirement , in any country of the world .
tr	Def	This person is not coming to visit you - the whole point of this scam is to gain your trust enough to steal your money and identity
tr	Def	Contact the Anti - Fraud Centre to report this http :// www . antifraudcentre - centreantifraude . ca / english / home - eng . html
tr	Def	BTA only exists in the mind of SCAMMERS .
tr	Def	The below site from the US government verifies this - it ' s the same for Canada , too .....
tr	Def	"He ' s the issue , you are trying to "" Make "" them mate ."
tr	Def	Then the environment .
tr	Def	The difference is what they need to live , VS what ' s ideal for them .
tr	Def	Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other .
tr	Def	Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Def	The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish , or a few of them , but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in .
tr	Def	The p H should be 6 . 5 - 7 .
tr	Def	Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Def	Then add the other mate .
tr	Def	When the males aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
tr	Def	The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them .
tr	Def	Turn the water temp up to 82 degrees
tr	Def	When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
tr	Def	I ' m talking soaking all the litter box and then some .
tr	Def	She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath .
tr	Def	I don ' t have the money to take her to a vet right now but it ' s getting to be an issue .
tr	Def	I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
tr	Def	What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first ?
tr	Def	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Def	If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
tr	Def	Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney , I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease , which untreated can lead to possible renal failure .
tr	Def	Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream .
tr	Def	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Def	In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .
tr	Def	"According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / immigrate / skilled / assess / index . asp , it states "" Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing ."""
tr	Def	"HOWEVER ... that same web page also states that "" The current pass mark is 67 ."
tr	Def	The pass mark could change .
tr	Def	The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency .
tr	Def	And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
tr	Def	""" 4 . May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points ?"""
tr	Def	""" If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada , the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion ( referred to as substituted evaluation ) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points ."""
tr	Def	Read the full answer at that web page for conditions .
tr	Def	The points system acts as a guide to sort out the best candidates .
tr	Def	"67 is the minimum score , anything below that is filed in the "" circular file basket ""."
tr	Def	So I kept reading and then I saw the dates , it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday . :(
tr	Def	then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates .
tr	Def	1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .
tr	Def	The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .
tr	Def	Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
tr	Def	The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ rebirth ”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .
tr	Def	These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages .
tr	Def	2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .
tr	Def	The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardos fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de ' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .
tr	Def	"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann ."
tr	Def	[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over - simplifying artistic developments , ignoring historical context , and focusing only on a few iconic works .
tr	Def	I ' m American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
tr	Def	do you get your visitors visa immediately at the airport ?
tr	Def	or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
tr	Def	I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really don ' t have the money for .
tr	Def	You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
tr	Def	Above is the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , including passport information .
tr	Def	You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
tr	Def	Either way rec . and dom . white genes dilute the black gene .
tr	Def	Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies .
tr	Def	The lighting was not the best , but the pics turned out ok in my opinion .
tr	Def	you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
tr	Def	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Def	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
tr	Def	There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
tr	Def	In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a corner of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord .
tr	Def	In the shot from the back , the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
tr	Def	I do like the shadow , though .
tr	Def	My suggestion is to pay close attention to what ' s going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
tr	Def	As far ask I ’ m aware our most unique custom would be the “ Country Wake ”.
tr	Def	In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
tr	Def	The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .
tr	Def	Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
tr	Def	But only really in the countryside .
tr	Def	The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
tr	Def	The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
tr	Def	I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
tr	Def	The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one .
tr	Def	The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
tr	Def	Barn brack and the ring .
tr	Def	the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
tr	Def	As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
tr	Def	The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
tr	Def	So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
tr	Def	So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T . V ., it ’ s probably because of the sounds .
tr	Def	im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
tr	Def	I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
tr	Def	The place where I ' m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
tr	Def	Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver ' s time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
tr	Def	Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
tr	Def	Rusted , torn corners in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse .
tr	Def	Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
tr	Def	I mean literally around the world if possible .
tr	Def	Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to ?
tr	Def	Like you can pick the destinations ?
tr	Def	You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ).
tr	Def	Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines , typically 100 days in duration .
tr	Def	Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
tr	Def	Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i . e Transatlantic to London ( England ), England to Barcelona ( Spain ), Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ), Egypt to India via Suez canal etc .
tr	Def	yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
tr	Def	HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
tr	Def	Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
tr	Def	The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
tr	Def	The Mission was basically latin - american .
tr	Def	As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
tr	Def	So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that ' s because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that ' s who the photographers took pictures of .
tr	Def	The other ethicities weren ' t well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70 ' s due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
tr	Def	Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
tr	Def	Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid - 80s .
tr	Def	We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
tr	Def	We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then .
tr	Def	San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers .
tr	Def	The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
tr	Def	However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
tr	Def	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Def	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Def	Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
tr	Def	Just the zinc fumes will get you , if you don ' t take precautions .
tr	Def	When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
tr	Def	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Def	Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
tr	Def	Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
tr	Def	I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I ' m 14 by the way
tr	Def	Maybe if they see how much time and effort you ' ve devoted to researching the animal they ' ll reconsider .
tr	Def	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Def	Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
tr	Def	4 . Play the sympathy card .
tr	Def	On the fear angle -- talk her into coming to the pet store with you .
tr	Def	So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
tr	Def	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Def	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
tr	Def	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Def	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Def	I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane .
tr	Def	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Def	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
tr	Def	Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen / thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run .
tr	Def	You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
tr	Def	YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history , combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record , and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration .
tr	Def	IF you have NOT begun the Application process ' s NOW < you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada .
tr	Def	He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
tr	Def	This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
tr	Def	This way , he cannot reach the leash to chew it .
tr	Def	Patience is the key here .
tr	Def	All the best .
tr	Def	or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
tr	Def	I ' m looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
tr	Def	There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000 , close to the centre of these cities .
tr	Def	I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
tr	Def	But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
tr	Def	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Def	which one out of these makes the best pet ?
tr	Def	and why is the one a better pet ?
tr	Def	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
tr	Def	Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
tr	Def	My favorite would have to be the rat .
tr	Def	"Mine learned to "" go to the bathroom "" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch ."
tr	Def	The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
tr	Def	My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine wasn ' t ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
tr	Def	Guinea pigs ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
tr	Def	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Def	That ' s kind of the way it goes .. lol .
tr	Def	If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
tr	Def	Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
tr	Def	But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ' ll be interacting with the kittens .
tr	Def	Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
tr	Def	Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
tr	Def	If you still don ' t enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
tr	Def	I find the adults are much easier .
tr	Def	Take the kittens back to the shelter .
tr	Def	Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
tr	Def	what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Def	what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Def	It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
tr	Def	Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child ' s birth at the town hall / registrar ' s office .
tr	Def	The birth registration was done right in hospital .
tr	Def	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Def	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Def	This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
tr	Def	None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .
tr	Def	they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
tr	Def	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Def	Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
tr	Def	Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best .
tr	Def	For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Def	Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St . Thomas , the Bahamas and St . Martin / St . Maarten .
tr	Def	The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
tr	Def	The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ).
tr	Def	We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don ' t believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
tr	Def	Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
tr	Def	We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
tr	Def	On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
tr	Def	If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
tr	Def	Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Def	We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Def	Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
tr	Def	We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
tr	Def	Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
tr	Def	We liked the Liberty ' s pools better because one had a slide .
tr	Def	Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
tr	Def	We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Def	Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas .
tr	Def	Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
tr	Def	What countries are the best to travel to ?
tr	Def	Where in the states could I go ?
tr	Def	I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
tr	Def	Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you ' ve never traveled before and you don ' t put where you would be traveling from .
tr	Def	In the United States ?
tr	Def	There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
tr	Def	Big Cities like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast .
tr	Def	Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston .
tr	Def	The federal sites of Washington , DC .
tr	Def	Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US .
tr	Def	Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica .
tr	Def	Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
tr	Def	You can ' t beat the price for what you get .
tr	Def	We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it .
tr	Def	the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ), but others will work just as well .
tr	Def	close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
tr	Def	he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
tr	Def	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Def	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Def	remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
tr	Def	remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
tr	Def	Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
tr	Def	I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
tr	Def	He wont even get close to the crate .
tr	Def	... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
tr	Def	There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
tr	Def	Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
tr	Def	Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
tr	Def	When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
tr	Def	Do not shut the door .
tr	Def	At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
tr	Def	Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
tr	Def	With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
tr	Def	where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
tr	Def	I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
tr	Def	If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
tr	Def	The are located right at 248 De Than St . in the heart of the back packer district .
tr	Def	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Def	The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
tr	Def	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Def	Most of the tourists that I ' ve come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
tr	Def	The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
tr	Def	It ' s called Kiwi Heaven and it ' s across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
tr	Def	Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
tr	Def	Then the same thing with the other leg .
tr	Def	If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
tr	Def	BTW you dont want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
tr	Def	ya i really wouldn ' t bother with the yoga
tr	Def	with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it ' s forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
tr	Def	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Def	The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
tr	Def	I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
tr	Def	Thank you for the help .
tr	Def	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Def	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Def	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .
tr	Def	However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
tr	Def	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
tr	Def	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
tr	Def	However , I ' ve read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
tr	Def	They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
tr	Def	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
tr	Def	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Def	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
tr	Def	Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
tr	Def	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Def	Unfair for the girl as boys don ' t have that kind of handicap , but that ' s the way our own rules work .
tr	Def	I ' m just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
tr	Def	Your answer doesn ' t do anything but remind me that I ' m going to be $ 25 , 000 in debt by the time I ' m 22 .
tr	Def	I didn ' t think I ' d be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
tr	Def	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
tr	Def	At the moment there ' s no interest , but that ' ll probably change .
tr	Def	And they ' re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
tr	Def	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they ' ll force you cough up .
tr	Def	I wouldn ' t like not having the option to return to NZ .
tr	Def	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Def	according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
tr	Def	he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
tr	Def	( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won ' t eat .)
tr	Def	i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake ' s face .
tr	Def	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Def	In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
tr	Def	King snakes sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
tr	Def	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Def	For example , some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall .
tr	Def	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Def	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Def	you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
tr	Def	giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
tr	Def	put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
tr	Def	make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
tr	Def	this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
tr	Def	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Def	the territory thing will be solved .
tr	Def	your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
tr	Def	give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
tr	Def	putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .
tr	Def	The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
tr	Def	What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?
tr	Def	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
tr	Def	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Def	He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
tr	Def	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ).
tr	Def	When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia .
tr	Def	All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated .
tr	Def	However , Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases .
tr	Def	The Communists agreed .
tr	Def	They could not defeat the Americans .
tr	Def	However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
tr	Def	The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
tr	Def	THAT WAS THE PLAN .
tr	Def	The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas .
tr	Def	The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked .
tr	Def	Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
tr	Def	The government did NOT fall .
tr	Def	And the South Vietnamese people ?
tr	Def	When give the ultimate choice , they rallied …
tr	Def	TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT ….
tr	Def	They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
tr	Def	The people rejected their attempt to topple the government , and for all intents and purposes the US military ( and the ARVN ) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time - frame he ordered it .
tr	Def	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Def	The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ).
tr	Def	In the end Nixon kept his promise for “… peace with honor ….”
tr	Def	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Def	To make the war unpalatable to the American public .
tr	Def	Before Tet , the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA .
tr	Def	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Def	Try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
tr	Def	"My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the "" sun rays "" he needs ?"
tr	Def	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Def	"Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "" light ,"" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
tr	Def	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that ' s the easy one to provide for .
tr	Def	UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
tr	Def	The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed ' s Repsitun model : http :// lllreptile . com / store / catalog / reptile - supplies / uvb - fluorescent - lights - mercury - vapor - bulbs /-/ zoo - med - 24 - repti - sun - 100 - fluorescent - bulb / Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .
tr	Def	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Def	Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
tr	Def	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Def	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Def	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Def	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Def	As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
tr	Def	Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so its anyone ' s guess whether or not he ' ll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
tr	Def	Please choose the parakeet ...
tr	Def	I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
tr	Def	The whole family loves them .
tr	Def	They are both about the same noise level .
tr	Def	( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ).
tr	Def	the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .
tr	Def	The girl has either pink or brown .
tr	Def	They are the best !
tr	Def	However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
tr	Def	My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
tr	Def	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Def	These are the steps I used .
tr	Def	1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
tr	Def	2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .
tr	Def	I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
tr	Def	Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
tr	Def	( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
tr	Def	( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
tr	Def	3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .
tr	Def	( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food )....
tr	Def	( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
tr	Def	and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
tr	Def	When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
tr	Def	I graduate in the spring , and so we ' d like to go between then and winter .
tr	Def	We don ' t want too many tourists , and since we ' ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
tr	Def	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Def	We ' re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we ' re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
tr	Def	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Def	It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
tr	Def	And then there ’ s the rain .
tr	Def	County Kerry is the worst affected .
tr	Def	The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
tr	Def	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Def	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Def	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Def	Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
tr	Def	Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country ’ s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
tr	Def	Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ’ s Festival .
tr	Def	Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular .
tr	Def	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Def	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
tr	Def	"As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "" there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes """
tr	Def	If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
tr	Def	The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ?).
tr	Def	Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
tr	Def	To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don ' t have a bus or train service .
tr	Def	By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
tr	Def	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
tr	Def	Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
tr	Def	The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
tr	Def	We had frosts in October so I wouldn ' t advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
tr	Def	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Def	Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies ?
tr	Def	I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
tr	Def	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Def	Checkout the second source .
tr	Def	I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .
tr	Def	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Def	With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
tr	Def	They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
tr	Def	The water changes help with that too .
tr	Def	You also may need to treat the incubation water .
tr	Def	The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
tr	Def	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Def	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Def	3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?
tr	Def	TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist ' s hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department ' s annual reports .
tr	Def	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Def	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Def	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
tr	Def	But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
tr	Def	In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container .
tr	Def	Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .
tr	Def	Hope there is useful grist for the mill here .
tr	Def	What is the best time of year ?
tr	Def	What is the best option ?
tr	Def	There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
tr	Def	The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters .
tr	Def	Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
tr	Def	No , the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages .
tr	Def	Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
tr	Def	Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
tr	Def	Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers .
tr	Def	Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
tr	Def	The ship offers variety of eatables , deliciously made .
tr	Def	There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
tr	Def	There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
tr	Def	They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
tr	Def	The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
tr	Def	These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
tr	Def	Also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion .
tr	Def	To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option .
tr	Def	There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
tr	Def	You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
tr	Def	Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
tr	Def	You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays .
tr	Def	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Def	Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
tr	Def	We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
tr	Def	All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
tr	Def	You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
tr	Def	off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season .
tr	Def	My wife and I , in our 60 ' s at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
tr	Def	There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
tr	Def	The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones .
tr	Def	The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities .
tr	Def	The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
tr	Def	Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife ' s taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
tr	Def	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Def	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Def	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Def	This is about the fourth time they ' ve done my horse ' s feet because I just switched back to them .
tr	Def	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Def	Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
tr	Def	I ' ve known the guy for about 10 years .
tr	Def	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Def	"It ' s always just "" Okay , they ' re feet need to be done , better call the farrier ."""
tr	Def	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
tr	Def	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
tr	Def	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
tr	Def	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Def	Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
tr	Def	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Def	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Def	From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he ' s doing a really shitty job .
tr	Def	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Def	Here ' s what the owner has said :
tr	Def	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Def	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
tr	Def	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ).
tr	Def	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
tr	Def	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Def	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
tr	Def	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
tr	Def	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
tr	Def	So I might get the horse and see what I can do .
tr	Def	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
tr	Def	Worse comes to worse , I ' m out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
tr	Def	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
tr	Def	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Def	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Def	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
tr	Def	The owner is the one who is unable .
tr	Def	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Def	He ' s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn ' t be related ).
tr	Def	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Def	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Def	He ' s dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days .
tr	Def	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
tr	Def	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
tr	Def	Gallop , I ' ve already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .
tr	Def	I will have the EPM test done before treating .
tr	Def	The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
tr	Def	If that is the case then acupuncture isn ' t going to hurt him .
tr	Def	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Def	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Def	Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .
tr	Def	If so go for it and I ' ll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .
tr	Def	Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
tr	Def	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
tr	Def	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
tr	Def	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Def	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
tr	Def	So all in all , put the money up front before taking on this horse .
tr	Def	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Def	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Def	The food was out standing .
tr	Def	The shop was great , the service was excellent and the employees were fun guys .
tr	Def	I had to take care of the ants myself .
tr	Def	But I found the location wonderful and the neighbors very kind .
tr	Def	Loved the pool and BBQ .
tr	Def	Because of the ants I dropped them to a 3 star .
tr	Def	The real testament is not in how much she likes your animals but how much they like her .
tr	Def	the guy came on time and didn ' t take any breaks , he went straight to work and finished the job efficiently and promptly !
tr	Def	i couldn ' t be more happier with the way my garage looks .
tr	Def	He took the time to explain things to me about my computer , i would recommend you go to him .
tr	Def	its great to know you can get great service , great product , and for the best price all in one !
tr	Def	I ' ve referred everyone i know here and they all feel the same way !!
tr	Def	He was less than half of the price of the cheapest quote we got , and his work was top notch .
tr	Def	They even want to go to school on the weekends !!
tr	Def	I rang SRD PAT testing and within 3 hours Scot had come to my premises and PAT tested all my our Spill The Whisky barn dance band equipment , and supplied a certificate for only 70p per unit .
tr	Def	Hands down , best place in the area !
tr	Def	I go in about every morning to get bagels for myself or my co - workers and the employees at Max ' s are great !!
tr	Def	prepared the road test with a driving ... prepared the road test with a driving school in edmonton , but my instructor only trained me in a narrow street , hence I took one 90 minute lesson from the Noble driving school to learn the skill of changing lane , and found them very friendly and professional .
tr	Def	I was experiencing severe back pain to the point I could barely walk or even bare to sit .
tr	Def	Mr . Squeege is THE BEST .
tr	Def	You will find the same to be true for you .
tr	Def	In this hard economic times is very important to save money Very reasonable prices top quality work The owner operator he does all the the work with Helpers very friendly I definitely recommend this this guys Don ' t get jack by big companies that they pay alot of money to be on top of the list Thanks
tr	Def	It has to be one of the nicest pubs that i have been into in a long time , the decor is nice and it has a really nice garden and a lovely decking area .
tr	Def	This store is by far the worst Verizon store I ' ve been in .
tr	Def	The salespeople are never available , the lines are always too long , and all the people want is a sale .
tr	Def	They were accomdating with my scheduled and work with my insurance to get payment for the surgery .
tr	Def	Dr . Wallen explained the procedure in detail and took his time with me .
tr	Def	The best in the area !
tr	Def	I am very pleased with the tattoos that I revived from them .
tr	Def	The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable .
tr	Def	The program has been a postive experience for my children .
tr	Def	The program is well established and we have been extremely satisfied with the teachers , the programs and the director .
tr	Def	The employees make you feel very comfortable and are very helpful , whether you are very knowledgeable or don ' t know anything at all about wine .
tr	Def	The team at Bradley Chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death !
tr	Def	Their store is dusty , dirty and feels like you ' re stepping into the 1970s .
tr	Def	This place is the opposite of QuikTrip : crappy in every way .
tr	Def	Baffled by the one - star reviews
tr	Def	Best Chineese food in the area
tr	Def	The food here is fresh and hot out of the Wok .
tr	Def	The food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty .
tr	Def	The lunch specials are more food than most people can eat for about $ 6 .
tr	Def	It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
tr	Def	It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others .
tr	Def	The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients .
tr	Def	I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carried out the electrical work ), they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor .
tr	Def	I would have had to because with the economy the way it is i aint haves much monies fo repairs round the House ....
tr	Def	Comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap .
tr	Def	But this location has the worst weekend staff I ' ve seen EVER .
tr	Def	Skip te rest - this is the best
tr	Def	Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion ( Not Digital ) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
tr	Def	You charge SO MUCH , yet you use the same grounds over and over again .
tr	Def	The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter .
tr	Def	CHANGE THE PROCESS , PPL !
tr	Def	I love the people , the product and the service !
tr	Def	The Brick , Ikea , and Leon ' s have their place .
tr	Def	The internet here is terrible .
tr	Def	Like the previous poster said , the com lines are split between the entire building .
tr	Def	The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice , but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap .
tr	Def	You can ' t go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
tr	Def	So confused at the payment area .
tr	Def	Hair By Nivine in eastgardens fixed my hair after i had my hair cut and colored at another salon i felt more confident and the girls are fantastic and ive been going there now for 2 years always happy and they care about my hair had my hair done for my wedding it looked fabolous !
tr	Def	The waiting staff is beyond impeccable ( they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom ).
tr	Def	If you want great food then L ' espalier is the place to go .
tr	Def	I didn ' t end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
tr	Def	The Best Deals in Town
tr	Def	My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time .
tr	Def	The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina .
tr	Def	The service at Instep was great !!
tr	Def	The staff will not even answer the phone for take out .
tr	Def	Since then we have decided to have them manage our other investment properties as well as we getting older and can no longer perform all the inquires .
tr	Def	We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I ' m extremely happy with the whole thing .
tr	Def	From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
tr	Def	Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales persons attention .
tr	Def	It wasn ' t until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you .
tr	Def	However , during the test , they did whatever they can to get my test failed .
tr	Def	You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt .
tr	Def	The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude .
tr	Def	If this is the best that Tucson has to offer , I am outta here ...
tr	Def	Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
tr	Def	We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in .
tr	Def	The rooms were very clean , including the microwave and refrigerator .
tr	Def	Deb Watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great !!!
tr	Def	This was after I brought the car !!!!!
tr	Def	It ' s the best meal for the money you will find in all of metro Atlanta .
tr	Def	Le petit is the best place to get your nails done !

tr	Def	Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake .
tr	Def	Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
tr	Def	Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
tr	Def	The comment below definitely needs to be retracted !
tr	Def	It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal !
tr	Def	We sat in the front dining area , it was very cozy and pleasant .
tr	Def	Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic .
tr	Def	The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful .
tr	Def	The followup visit is FREE !!
tr	Def	After going to the hospital and paying ER prices ... there is no way I won ' t be back here !!
tr	Def	I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
tr	Def	The salads are limp and the rest of the food isn ' t any better ( ok , the nachos are not too bad !)
tr	Def	I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it .
tr	Def	thanks guys goes really well and thaks 4 the cheap price ..
tr	Def	This is the original Ham ' s restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80 ' s -- but this one is no more .
tr	Def	According to news accounts , the company is struggling .
tr	Def	We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
tr	Def	I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
tr	Def	I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
tr	Def	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Def	Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
tr	Def	They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
tr	Def	The BEST
tr	Def	Dr . Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .

tr	Def	Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish .
tr	Def	They have messed up my order and .... The food was just not good !

tr	Def	We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
tr	Def	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Def	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
tr	Def	I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
tr	Def	Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
tr	Def	My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
tr	Def	The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
tr	Def	Then the desserts came , and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had .

tr	Def	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Def	The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
tr	Def	Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
tr	Def	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
tr	Def	His knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application , ensuring compliance with the building regulations .
tr	Def	We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close .
tr	Def	Got the crab rangoon which was great , tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good .
tr	Def	Bea was really nice and asked how the food was .
tr	Def	Esp . the mole , tortilla soup , and guacamole .
tr	Def	My only complaint is the QUESO .
tr	Def	They fixed the queso !
tr	Def	I had the morelias enchiladas .
tr	Def	The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good . at all .
tr	Def	Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
tr	Def	James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
tr	Def	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Def	When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tr	Def	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
tr	Def	To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New movies not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people who spend $ 30 or more groceries ..
tr	Def	Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
tr	Def	I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I ' ve had with bigger offices and firms .
tr	Def	Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
tr	Def	The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
tr	Def	This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body don ' t be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
tr	Def	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Def	The service is poor ...
tr	Def	Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel ' s chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
tr	Def	The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
tr	Def	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
tr	Def	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
tr	Def	Best jiu - jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up !
tr	Def	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Def	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Def	Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
tr	Def	Absolute horrible service from the parts department .
tr	Def	They are very rude over the phone and in person .
tr	Def	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
tr	Def	Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
tr	Def	Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
tr	Def	The salesperson refused !
tr	Def	We were the only customers there !
tr	Def	The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
tr	Def	Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food .
tr	Def	But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
tr	Def	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Def	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I ' ma bit surprised by other comments .
tr	Def	They have the best prices locally and good customer service .
tr	Def	Another great business bites the dust !
tr	Def	The best cakes EVER !
tr	Def	The prices were worth what I got .
tr	Def	I ' m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
tr	Def	What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you ' re in a small town rather than Baltimore .
tr	Def	The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
tr	Def	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
tr	Def	The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
tr	Def	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
tr	Def	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I ' ll definitely order a steak .
tr	Def	They interviewed me , gave me tests in the software I included on my resume , and placed me in a position that I kept for several years .
tr	Def	I ' m really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
tr	Def	They are dependable , have great connections in the community , and are a great resource for finding a job .
tr	Def	The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding .
tr	Def	If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don ' t forget to check out the shelters !
tr	Def	Had to go the the bus boys station ourselves to get napkins .
tr	Def	Dr . Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had .
tr	Def	Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
tr	Def	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
tr	Def	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
tr	Def	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Def	The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
tr	Def	Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in ( many of them still unresolved as I left ) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds , after I left . . . . as soon as I could .
tr	Def	Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
tr	Def	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Def	Check out The Willow Lounge , youll be happy !
tr	Def	Don ' t let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !
tr	Def	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Def	The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
tr	Def	I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
tr	Def	It ' s located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
tr	Def	The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories .
tr	Def	The friendly crew working was great & very helpful .
tr	Def	I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
tr	Def	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Def	The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
tr	Def	We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
tr	Def	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
tr	Def	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Def	The worst Burger King restaurant !!!
tr	Def	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
tr	Def	The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
tr	Def	Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
tr	Def	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
tr	Def	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Def	The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal .
tr	Def	Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
tr	Def	We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it ' s worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
tr	Def	This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
tr	Def	The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
tr	Def	They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
tr	Def	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
tr	Def	The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
tr	Def	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Def	The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
tr	Def	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
tr	Def	I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
tr	Def	Stephanie ' s knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
tr	Def	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Def	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you ' ll be good .
tr	Def	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
tr	Def	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Def	For cheap Chinese food , this is the place to go .
tr	Def	The best value I ' ve found from a Chinese restaurant .
tr	Def	I don ' t live in Lake St . Louis anymore , but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous .
tr	Def	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin ' : sadface :
tr	Def	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
tr	Def	Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
tr	Def	Equipment is state of the art .
tr	Def	I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
tr	Def	We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
tr	Def	We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job everyday .
tr	Def	And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
tr	Def	I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already !
tr	Def	This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
tr	Def	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Def	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
tr	Def	Bad service starting from the front desk .
tr	Def	The best person is the valet .
tr	Def	I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
tr	Def	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
tr	Def	The fitness center was GREAT !
tr	Def	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Def	The Best Service Ever !!
tr	Def	The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
tr	Def	The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
tr	Def	THIS PLACE IS THE BEST .
tr	Def	The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .
tr	Def	The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
tr	Def	The atmosphere may not be for everyone .
tr	Def	Love the soups .
tr	Def	The New Italian Kid on the Block
tr	Def	Only if it is of the quality of That ' s Amore .
tr	Def	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Def	The arancini di riso ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
tr	Def	Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there ' s the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
tr	Def	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I ' m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
tr	Def	Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used .
tr	Def	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
tr	Def	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
tr	Def	Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
tr	Def	Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was “ excellent ”.
tr	Def	The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach !
tr	Def	Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
tr	Def	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
tr	Def	They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
tr	Def	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Def	I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
tr	Def	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Def	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Def	If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia .
tr	Def	They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet .
tr	Def	You will also have the pleasure of learning the Italiano language .
tr	Def	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
tr	Def	I ' ve never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
tr	Def	If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired !
tr	Def	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
tr	Def	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
tr	Def	The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
tr	Def	Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
tr	Def	Any ER would be the same .
tr	Def	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Def	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Def	This school is the worst one i ' ve ever been to .
tr	Def	There ' s holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
tr	Def	The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they don ' t listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student ' s ).
tr	Def	The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
tr	Def	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
tr	Def	If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
tr	Def	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
tr	Def	The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
tr	Def	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Def	The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if your looking fot a good game and aren ' ta nerd , dont ask them .
tr	Def	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
tr	Def	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn ' ta fps .
tr	Def	Overall they aren ' t very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
tr	Def	BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
tr	Def	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Def	The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
tr	Def	Hino Dealer of the Year
tr	Def	You have been awarded the converted Hino Dealer of the Year !
tr	Def	Each of you should be proud of your massive contributions throughout the year !
tr	Def	Major Awards – Overall Hino dealer of the year .
tr	Def	Overall Hino finance dealer of the year .
tr	Def	Well done to Anthony and the team !
tr	Def	Well done to Brendan and the team !
tr	Def	Well done to Jason and the team !
tr	Def	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
tr	Def	Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I ' ve ever eaten ( and I ' ve eaten a lot ).
tr	Def	The antipasti were amazing , the wines were mind - blowing , the service couldn ' t have been better .
tr	Def	The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
tr	Def	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Def	Top notch , all the way !
tr	Def	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
tr	Def	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Def	He got the pictures back to me quickly .
tr	Def	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Def	The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
tr	Def	When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy didn ' t know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
tr	Def	So what was the point of the appointment !?!
tr	Def	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Def	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Def	I did the work myself for $ 50 .
tr	Def	# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
tr	Def	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
tr	Def	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
tr	Def	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates .
tr	Def	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
tr	Def	I would appreciate reviews from anyone who has worked with me before in the mental health setting .
tr	Def	They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
tr	Def	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Def	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
tr	Def	Among the animals that were available to touch were pony ' s , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
tr	Def	I can ' t say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
tr	Def	I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there isn ' t .
tr	Def	2 ) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
tr	Def	4 ) The business is very unorganized .
tr	Def	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Def	Exile is the best !!!
tr	Def	Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
tr	Def	The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
tr	Def	The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
tr	Def	In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
tr	Def	Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that doesn ' t impress me .
tr	Def	The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
tr	Def	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Def	The angry lobster was completely over - priced !
tr	Def	From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
tr	Def	The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
tr	Def	I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
tr	Def	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Def	The landlord is not nice nor helpful
tr	Def	I love the location and the apartment !!
tr	Def	The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
tr	Def	And the exterminator is very nice , also .
tr	Def	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
tr	Def	The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
tr	Def	The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
tr	Def	She may be the reason for all the change .
tr	Def	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
tr	Def	I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
tr	Def	"Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , "" one can see forever "" a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur ."
tr	Def	There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
tr	Def	and most correctly , us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife .
tr	Def	Kathy and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection .
tr	Def	"The neon lighting sign still said "" on "" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they ' d be open tomorrow ."
tr	Def	It ' s not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
tr	Def	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Def	They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
tr	Def	The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
tr	Def	We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
tr	Def	Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts .
tr	Def	The waiters are like no other ...
tr	Def	The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
tr	Def	Holly is truely the best hairstylist !
tr	Def	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
tr	Def	All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
tr	Def	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Def	My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
tr	Def	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Def	The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
tr	Def	Great , and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville .
tr	Def	The finest Christmas Trees i ' ve ever seen .
tr	Def	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
tr	Def	The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
tr	Def	The owners were entertaining and gracious .
tr	Def	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals .
tr	Def	This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
tr	Def	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
tr	Def	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
tr	Def	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I ' ve always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
tr	Def	all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
tr	Def	The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
tr	Def	the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
tr	Def	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Def	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
tr	Def	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Def	"He told me "" no problem , we will match the offer or do better ."""
tr	Def	Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world .
tr	Def	I urge all St . Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
tr	Def	The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
tr	Def	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
tr	Def	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
tr	Def	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Def	Kelly hit the nail on the head .
tr	Def	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
tr	Def	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Def	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Def	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Def	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Def	"I regularly request Kim ' s business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!!"""
tr	Def	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
tr	Def	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
tr	Def	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Def	If you cannot park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center ' s garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
tr	Def	The service is fast .
tr	Def	Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
tr	Def	( it ' s by the door , on the hostess stand )
tr	Def	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Def	Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
tr	Def	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
tr	Def	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Def	Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances .
tr	Def	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Def	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
tr	Def	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
tr	Def	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
tr	Def	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Def	I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
tr	Def	Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
tr	Def	For the quality , the prices ($ 4 -$ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
tr	Def	The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
tr	Def	Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
tr	Def	Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light .
tr	Def	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Def	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Def	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Def	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
tr	Def	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
tr	Def	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Def	I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
tr	Def	The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
tr	Def	I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
tr	Def	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren ' t paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
tr	Def	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Def	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
tr	Def	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
tr	Def	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Def	She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
tr	Def	I didn ' t even buy the bag there !
tr	Def	Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don ' t have what you need .
tr	Def	The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
tr	Def	The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
tr	Def	The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
tr	Def	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Def	Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
tr	Def	Don ' t know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
tr	Def	Cons : * Server wasn ' t very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
tr	Def	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
tr	Def	the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
tr	Def	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
tr	Def	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Def	if you don ' t mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
tr	Def	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Def	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Def	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Def	The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp . Edwin , are just wonderful .
tr	Def	Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
tr	Def	The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe ' s , Whole Foods , and other stores .
tr	Def	The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
tr	Def	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Def	Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service .
tr	Def	Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right .
tr	Def	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Def	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Def	If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
tr	Def	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Def	In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
tr	Def	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Def	The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
tr	Def	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Def	And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
tr	Def	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Def	Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ($ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
tr	Def	One of the worst places
tr	Def	This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
tr	Def	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Def	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Def	in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
tr	Def	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
tr	Def	Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
tr	Def	However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
tr	Def	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
tr	Def	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Def	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
tr	Def	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Def	Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
tr	Def	You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
tr	Def	Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
tr	Def	Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
tr	Def	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Def	On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
tr	Def	You won ' t even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
tr	Def	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
tr	Def	Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
tr	Def	Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
tr	Def	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Def	"When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had "" reserved """
tr	Def	The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company ' s were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
tr	Def	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Def	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
tr	Def	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
tr	Def	The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
tr	Def	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Def	The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
tr	Def	( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
tr	Def	So I brought the car back the second day .
tr	Def	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
tr	Def	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
tr	Def	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Def	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
tr	Def	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Def	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Def	I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
tr	Def	I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
tr	Def	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Def	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
tr	Def	The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
tr	Def	The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
tr	Def	Run for the hills ... you ' ll be much better off !
tr	Def	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Def	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Def	"I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "" This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton "" and the receptionist then hung up on me ."
tr	Def	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Def	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
tr	Def	This is by far the BEST B & B that we have ever stayed at !
tr	Def	The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
tr	Def	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Def	We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
tr	Def	A & E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
tr	Def	The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A & E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A & E does not ).
tr	Def	Their quote came in at half the price of A & E for the same work and same part .
tr	Def	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
tr	Def	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Def	If the pedicure lasted 20 mins ., that was a stretch .
tr	Def	The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
tr	Def	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Def	The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
tr	Def	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
tr	Def	The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
tr	Def	The location is really stellar !
tr	Def	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Def	We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
tr	Def	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ).
tr	Def	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Def	So yes , I wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
tr	Def	I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
tr	Def	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
tr	Def	Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
tr	Def	There could have ( hopefully doesn ' t have ) major damage to the engine .
tr	Def	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
tr	Def	However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
tr	Def	"They "" finished "" the work and told me the car was ready ."
tr	Def	I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
tr	Def	They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
tr	Def	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
tr	Def	The Peterson Family
tr	Def	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Def	The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
tr	Def	However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
tr	Def	This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “ no reservation , sign your name here ”.
tr	Def	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Def	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
tr	Def	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Def	The instructor did not show up !
tr	Def	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Def	Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
tr	Def	These guys were the best .
tr	Def	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Def	So we didn ' t expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
tr	Def	NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
tr	Def	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
tr	Def	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
tr	Def	At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
tr	Def	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
tr	Def	The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
tr	Def	Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
tr	Def	In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin !), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
tr	Def	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
tr	Def	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Def	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Def	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
tr	Def	My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
tr	Def	"The doctor ' s office said that payments had been "" reversed ""."
tr	Def	The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC / BS .
tr	Def	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160 . 00 has come through .
tr	Def	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
tr	Def	They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
tr	Def	Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
tr	Def	i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
tr	Def	"Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "" There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck ""."
tr	Def	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Def	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
tr	Def	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell ' s .
tr	Def	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Def	The craziest part is that they aren ' t even based locally at the city I ' m in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
tr	Def	I ' ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
tr	Def	This is THE premier university in Virginia .
tr	Def	It is also the largest .
tr	Def	VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
tr	Def	The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
tr	Def	VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
tr	Def	VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
tr	Def	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
tr	Def	The U of R is also recommended , too !
tr	Def	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who ' d arrived around 1 : 00 am and were drinking at the springs .
tr	Def	When we complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any problems ), nothing happened !
tr	Def	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Def	All to the good .
tr	Def	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Def	Absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
tr	Def	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Def	The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
tr	Def	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Def	I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and can ' t stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I ' m in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
tr	Def	The place is chill and comfortable .
tr	Def	They don ' t speak the best English but enough to get by .
tr	Def	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Def	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
tr	Def	I ' ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance )...
tr	Def	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
tr	Def	I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
tr	Def	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Def	Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
tr	Def	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
tr	Def	The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
tr	Def	They don ' t just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
tr	Def	The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
tr	Def	Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
tr	Def	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Def	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
tr	Def	The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
tr	Def	The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
tr	Def	The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
tr	Def	Just previews and the main feature .
tr	Def	Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
tr	Def	But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
tr	Def	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
tr	Def	I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
tr	Def	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
tr	Def	The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
tr	Def	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Def	By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
tr	Def	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
tr	Def	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
tr	Def	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Def	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Def	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Def	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Def	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Def	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
tr	Def	"Whereas my answer to the question "" Where do you get your laundry done ?"" used to be , "" At the checkout line at WalMart ,"" I can honestly say the answer now is , "" At The Laundry Tub ."""
tr	Def	They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
tr	Def	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Def	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Def	I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
tr	Def	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
tr	Def	Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
tr	Def	Okay , here ' s the scoop .
tr	Def	The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
tr	Def	I think they ' re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
tr	Def	In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ).
tr	Def	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Def	In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just doesn ' t care / know better .
tr	Def	Trust The Midas Touch
tr	Def	the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
tr	Def	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
tr	Def	Like the girl with the fuse problem ...
tr	Def	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical !
tr	Def	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
tr	Def	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Def	When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
tr	Def	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Def	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Def	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Def	The other rolls weren ' t at all special , especially given their pricing .
tr	Def	The bottom line is that the food isn ' t great and is relatively high - priced .
tr	Def	The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
tr	Def	But I ' d go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
tr	Def	At 3 : 15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
tr	Def	I called the front desk and got no answer .
tr	Def	The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ?).
tr	Def	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Def	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Def	Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
tr	Def	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
tr	Def	Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
tr	Def	The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
tr	Def	When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
tr	Def	And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture .
tr	Def	Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
tr	Def	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Def	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Def	Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
tr	Def	We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
tr	Def	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Def	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Def	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
tr	Def	The Worst Experience Ever !!!
tr	Def	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
tr	Def	Please everyone .... take heed and don ' t get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget ...
tr	Def	"When we walked in , the person behind desk said : "" oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something ."""
tr	Def	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
tr	Def	"When I inquired he rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out you ' ll get it back ."""
tr	Def	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Def	I also mentioned to the reception person .
tr	Def	I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
tr	Def	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
tr	Def	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
tr	Def	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
tr	Def	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet ' s that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
tr	Def	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
tr	Def	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Def	I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
tr	Def	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Def	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
tr	Def	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
tr	Def	The food was good , and so was our waitress .
tr	Def	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Def	The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
tr	Def	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Def	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Def	TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
tr	Def	ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR .
tr	Def	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
tr	Def	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
tr	Def	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Def	IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL .
tr	Def	their mezza luna ' s are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
tr	Def	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Def	anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
tr	Def	Perhaps they don ' t deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
tr	Def	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Def	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
tr	Def	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
tr	Def	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Def	I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
tr	Def	Thanks for the great deal and the great car !
tr	Def	Myself and my fiance ' s identity was stolen from the office staff .
tr	Def	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
tr	Def	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
tr	Def	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Def	The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
tr	Def	Short time later the guy would leave , then the girl .
tr	Def	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
tr	Def	Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
tr	Def	The best there is in service .
tr	Def	Not only did they answer the phone at 4 : 50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
tr	Def	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Def	I hope I can return the favor in the future !
tr	Def	I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get .
tr	Def	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Def	"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" you do not order what you do not know about "" and "" you don ' t know how pizza is made ""."
tr	Def	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
tr	Def	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
tr	Def	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
tr	Def	I mean , that ' s the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
tr	Def	"The staff taking your order and "" waiting "" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all ."
tr	Def	And don ' t even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is , and pardon my French , a jerk .
tr	Def	"If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are "" ok ,"" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
tr	Def	Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
tr	Def	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
tr	Def	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Def	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
tr	Def	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Def	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Def	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Def	Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
tr	Def	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that ' s a common misconception ( http :// www . consumerreports . org / health / healthy - living / beauty - personal - care / hair - loss - 10 - 08 / hair - loss . htm ).
tr	Def	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
tr	Def	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Def	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
tr	Def	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
tr	Def	From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
tr	Def	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
tr	Def	I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
tr	Def	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
tr	Def	Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
tr	Def	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Def	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
tr	Def	I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
tr	Def	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
tr	Def	I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
tr	Def	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Def	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Def	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
tr	Def	The service was excellent and personable .
tr	Def	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car .
tr	Def	We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
tr	Def	We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
tr	Def	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Def	2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
tr	Def	We are absolutely confident that Stuart ' s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
tr	Def	I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
tr	Def	The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that ' s not why I ' m writing my review .
tr	Def	Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
tr	Def	The intruders slit the screen of the window .
tr	Def	Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
tr	Def	The window didn ' t break !
tr	Def	My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind !).
tr	Def	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Def	Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and didn ' t charge me a dime .
tr	Def	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
tr	Def	Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1 : 00 am !
tr	Def	Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
tr	Def	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Def	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Def	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
tr	Def	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Def	The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
tr	Def	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
tr	Def	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Def	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Def	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Def	After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
tr	Def	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Def	I mean , I don ' t care if he doesn ' t know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there ' s no way I ' m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
tr	Def	The Worst Chinese I ' ve Ever Had
tr	Def	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Def	The service stunk .
tr	Def	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Def	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order .
tr	Def	Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
tr	Def	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
tr	Def	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Def	The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
tr	Def	One of the worst experiences I ' ve ever had with a auto repair shop .
tr	Def	Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
tr	Def	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Def	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Def	Nope , none of the above .
tr	Def	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Def	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Def	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Def	I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
tr	Def	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
tr	Def	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Def	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Def	I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
tr	Def	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Def	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
tr	Def	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Def	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Def	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner ' s own unprofessionalism .
tr	Def	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Def	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Def	Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun .
tr	Def	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
tr	Def	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
tr	Def	The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
tr	Def	The equipment and classes aren ' t good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
tr	Def	There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
tr	Def	The Salon Experience from Hell
tr	Def	Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
tr	Def	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Def	$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
tr	Def	I cried the entire way home .
tr	Def	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
tr	Def	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
tr	Def	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Def	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Def	However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6 , 000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
tr	Def	Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
tr	Def	In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
tr	Def	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
tr	Def	The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi - sketchiness .
tr	Def	Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
tr	Def	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Def	The other person working at the store didn ' t know that I still had this table coming .
tr	Def	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
tr	Def	After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces .
tr	Def	I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
tr	Def	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Def	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Def	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Def	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture .
tr	Def	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone ' s warehouse .
tr	Def	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Def	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
tr	Def	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Def	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn ' t feel comfortable driving an SUV .
tr	Def	....... the rest was history !
tr	Def	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
tr	Def	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Def	They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
tr	Def	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
tr	Def	The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
tr	Def	Because we think IT ' S THE BEST !!!
tr	Def	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Def	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Def	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
tr	Def	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
tr	Def	I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
tr	Def	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Def	What you can learn from the below ' bad experience '.
tr	Def	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
tr	Def	I ' ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
tr	Def	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Def	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Def	So I say : I ' m at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
tr	Def	I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I ' m at the Radison - Warwick .
tr	Def	I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
tr	Def	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Def	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
tr	Def	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Def	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Def	So I figure if they don ' t want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I ' ll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
tr	Def	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Def	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Def	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Def	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
tr	Def	The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
tr	Def	However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ).
tr	Def	Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
tr	Def	They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
tr	Def	# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
tr	Def	All these rules are posted in the rooms .)
tr	Def	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
tr	Def	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
tr	Def	Don ' t get the rooms off the two kitchens .
tr	Def	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
tr	Def	I ' d go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I wouldn ' t pay their rack rate .
tr	Def	Quit with the overstatements !
tr	Def	"The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "" everyone "" is going to "" love "" the food , decor and service ."
tr	Def	The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
tr	Def	Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
tr	Def	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).
tr	Def	That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
tr	Def	Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ).
tr	Def	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
tr	Def	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Def	Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
tr	Def	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
tr	Def	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Def	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Def	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .
tr	Def	So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
tr	Def	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Def	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Def	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Def	My point : Even if I was wrong , don ' t sit there and argue with the customer .
tr	Def	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
tr	Def	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn ' t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
tr	Def	After happily visiting Sear ' s Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
tr	Def	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Def	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn ' t possible .
tr	Def	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Def	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Def	I would not have gone back , but I couldn ' t find the particular tire they ' d used in stock anywhere else .
tr	Def	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Def	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Def	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Def	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Def	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Def	The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
tr	Def	The employees at this Sear ' s are completely apathetic and there didn ' t seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
tr	Def	I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ).
tr	Ind	[ This killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come .]
tr	Ind	Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul .
tr	Ind	On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home .
tr	Ind	( Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population , who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in .
tr	Ind	Guerrillas killed an engineer , Asi Ali , from Tikrit .
tr	Ind	They also killed Shaikh Hamid ' Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit .
tr	Ind	Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers .
tr	Ind	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Ind	This item is a small one and easily missed .
tr	Ind	If someone committed a crime against humanity , prosecute the person .
tr	Ind	Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
tr	Ind	A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died .
tr	Ind	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Ind	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Ind	This is not a post about fault - finding or assigning blame .
tr	Ind	It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
tr	Ind	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
tr	Ind	... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in women ' s reproductive health , an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ....
tr	Ind	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Ind	There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl .
tr	Ind	Being well - informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
tr	Ind	There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl .
tr	Ind	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Ind	Even a little time spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc . can add years to their lives .
tr	Ind	S . and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
tr	Ind	I ' m sorry to say Elena ' s story has been revealed to be a fake .
tr	Ind	If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts .
tr	Ind	They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .
tr	Ind	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Ind	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Ind	We need an FDR in Iraq , not a Ronald Reagan .
tr	Ind	Let ' s just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :
tr	Ind	"Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as "" Lee ."""
tr	Ind	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Ind	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Ind	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Ind	A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush ' s comments .
tr	Ind	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Ind	"Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the U . S . has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians ."""
tr	Ind	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Ind	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Ind	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .
tr	Ind	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country ' s petroleum reserves .

tr	Ind	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Ind	Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US $ 4 . 5 billion .
tr	Ind	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""

tr	Ind	“ In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots ,” Campenni says .
tr	Ind	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Ind	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Ind	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Ind	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Ind	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Ind	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer .”
tr	Ind	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Ind	Earlier , Kerry said , “ Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question .”

tr	Ind	I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
tr	Ind	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Ind	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Ind	But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I don ' t believe the US is going anywhere so soon .

tr	Ind	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Ind	Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference ; justice would not be served then .

tr	Ind	A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands , using fake Indian ration cards , while citizens of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave .

tr	Ind	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate . ]
tr	Ind	Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan ,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan ’ s English daily The Nation .
tr	Ind	That changed on September 22 when President George W . Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
tr	Ind	Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf .
tr	Ind	An Afghan official at the meeting added , ‘’ The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda .’’
tr	Ind	However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
tr	Ind	‘’ Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before ,’’ says Lt . General David Barno .
tr	Ind	Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
tr	Ind	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Ind	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate .
tr	Ind	In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai , Iran , Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai .
tr	Ind	However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates .
tr	Ind	At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’ s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo - conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively , the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran .
tr	Ind	‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters ,’’ says Barno .
tr	Ind	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .

tr	Ind	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Ind	Bush has a sadistic streak .

tr	Ind	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Ind	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Ind	In 1972 , Baba Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign .
tr	Ind	It was a Texas accent .
tr	Ind	Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days .
tr	Ind	Groom says this job helped Mr . Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics are local .
tr	Ind	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Ind	Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr . Bush was not one of them .
tr	Ind	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Ind	Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- didn ' t like that story .
tr	Ind	Again , decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
tr	Ind	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Ind	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Ind	American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq .
tr	Ind	"A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "" any weapons from Bosnia "" and added they were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia ""."
tr	Ind	"A NATO spokesman said : "" There ' s no tracking mechanism to ensure they don ' t fall into the wrong hands ."
tr	Ind	This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re - routed to al - Qaeda .
tr	Ind	It ' s always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration ' s harshest mainstream critics .
tr	Ind	"But then , even to talk of an "" administration "" may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative government means in the United States these days , and how much of "" national security "" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns ."

tr	Ind	When victims and witnesses speak up , at least sometimes a child is protected , the truth is exposed , and justice is done .
tr	Ind	Finally , from an email , a follow - up on the reopening of the investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders :
tr	Ind	lots of important stories out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good souls for that conviction .
tr	Ind	"An editorial in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "" the state ' s history , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet ' s nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach lawmakers and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities ."""
tr	Ind	Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
tr	Ind	I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
tr	Ind	Personally I don ' t give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
tr	Ind	a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
tr	Ind	It ' s a good thing too .
tr	Ind	What ' s a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash ?

tr	Ind	""" A View from the Eye of the Storm """
tr	Ind	Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi - national corporation , April , 2004 :
tr	Ind	I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
tr	Ind	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Ind	They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
tr	Ind	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Ind	According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U . N ., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
tr	Ind	And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
tr	Ind	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Ind	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Ind	A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
tr	Ind	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Ind	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
tr	Ind	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Ind	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Ind	But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
tr	Ind	Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
tr	Ind	Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
tr	Ind	Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .
tr	Ind	And it is a war !
tr	Ind	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
tr	Ind	A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Ind	An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
tr	Ind	Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
tr	Ind	Mr . Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
tr	Ind	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Ind	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Ind	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Ind	Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
tr	Ind	"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam ' s regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration ""."
tr	Ind	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid - day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
tr	Ind	"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "", the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader ""."
tr	Ind	They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
tr	Ind	It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
tr	Ind	They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
tr	Ind	Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
tr	Ind	Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti - democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
tr	Ind	Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
tr	Ind	Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
tr	Ind	Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
tr	Ind	"Does free speech protect you when you shout "" fire "" in a crowded theater ?"
tr	Ind	But now we have an entire new set .
tr	Ind	Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
tr	Ind	Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
tr	Ind	Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
tr	Ind	Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
tr	Ind	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Ind	Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
tr	Ind	Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
tr	Ind	Do you shoot an arch - murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
tr	Ind	I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
tr	Ind	It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
tr	Ind	International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
tr	Ind	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Ind	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Ind	Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
tr	Ind	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Ind	But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
tr	Ind	Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
tr	Ind	As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
tr	Ind	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Ind	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Ind	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Ind	If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
tr	Ind	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Ind	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Ind	"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ("" CIA "") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax ."
tr	Ind	"An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "" unbelievable "" biological attack , the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("" KSM "")."
tr	Ind	In November 2003 , a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties .
tr	Ind	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Ind	"According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda ’ s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face ."""
tr	Ind	Photographs from a seized computer disc included the controls and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot .
tr	Ind	In a bulletin , the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon .
tr	Ind	Many people have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the mailings served as a threat and warning .
tr	Ind	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Ind	Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 , included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise .
tr	Ind	There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development .
tr	Ind	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Ind	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Ind	"In March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9 / 11 but was to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Ind	Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $ 14 , 000 in July , accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks .
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda ' s regional operative , Hambali , who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat , has been captured .
tr	Ind	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Ind	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Ind	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Ind	"A few days before Christmas 2003 , after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks , to include in the US homeland , the threat level was raised to orange or "" high ."""
tr	Ind	Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
tr	Ind	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Ind	A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
tr	Ind	Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources .
tr	Ind	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Ind	Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns .
tr	Ind	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Ind	USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , in sensational detail , of Atta ' s inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster .
tr	Ind	"Sufaat was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ("" JI "")."
tr	Ind	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Ind	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Ind	As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino .
tr	Ind	"Newsweek reported that a "" second wave "" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support ."
tr	Ind	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Ind	It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui , who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology .
tr	Ind	Understandably , Amerithrax is a confidential investigation .
tr	Ind	Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March .
tr	Ind	Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad .
tr	Ind	"There still is a very hot pursuit of the "" Atta - level "" Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting ."
tr	Ind	A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot .
tr	Ind	In early June 2003 , a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax .
tr	Ind	Iraq , however , remains a possible source of the Ames .
tr	Ind	Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain .
tr	Ind	Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam ' s son .
tr	Ind	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Ind	Al Qaeda had a motive in mind .
tr	Ind	"Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "" either - or "" approach is not useful ."
tr	Ind	There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage .
tr	Ind	A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the conclusion that there were not one , but two , such mailings containing anthrax .
tr	Ind	( There initially was an outstanding $ 2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program , the reward now is up to $ 5 million .).
tr	Ind	"Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned , addressed to "" Parole Officer ."""
tr	Ind	A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
tr	Ind	"There ' s even a chapter titled "" Poisonous Letter "" in the Al Qaeda manual ."
tr	Ind	"A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "" In the Hearts of Green Birds "" refers to what is inside ."
tr	Ind	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Ind	In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise .
tr	Ind	"As to opportunity , though seldom reported , there is a wealth of "" open source "" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada ."
tr	Ind	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Ind	Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources .
tr	Ind	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
tr	Ind	A search of Dr . Ken Berry ' s residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory .
tr	Ind	Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress , Risk 2001 Australia , which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001 .
tr	Ind	Have you had an opportunity to consider the invitation yet ?
tr	Ind	Thanks a lot .
tr	Ind	As I mentioned in my voice mail , Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody , a recent MBA grad from Rice , into his group .
tr	Ind	Thanks a lot .
tr	Ind	Of course , you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce .
tr	Ind	oh god is there an agenda .

tr	Ind	I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1 - 2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything .
tr	Ind	I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1 - 2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything .
tr	Ind	I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
tr	Ind	Business Case : If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $ 10 , 000 increase ( approximately 25 %) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
tr	Ind	This is NOT an Enron - sponsored event .
tr	Ind	If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
tr	Ind	I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group .
tr	Ind	There is a corporate data sheet for this company , but this entity seems to have been inactive since it ' s creation .
tr	Ind	Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities , but no I / S items .
tr	Ind	A similar entity ( 1179 ) was assigned to Commodity and Trade ( Todd Richards and Mary Fischer ) so this one should be assigned to them as well .
tr	Ind	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a CFC .
tr	Ind	I see that it is a 4 , so that will be no problem .
tr	Ind	If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
tr	Ind	I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .
tr	Ind	I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
tr	Ind	They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection .
tr	Ind	I have also purchased an Appel in the last month .
tr	Ind	Actually , a lot .
tr	Ind	"It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling )."
tr	Ind	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20 , 000 .
tr	Ind	Please leave as a word document and make any changes and additions that you think necessary .
tr	Ind	San Antonio , wow what a let down from the other cities .
tr	Ind	That will be a nice time of year though .
tr	Ind	This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at St . Francis , which may be his new school ( so far , so good ).
tr	Ind	Neil has a meeting in San Antonio ( usually it is in Miami , San Francisco , Phoenix - not so great this year ).
tr	Ind	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
tr	Ind	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
tr	Ind	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what ' s in the draft ?
tr	Ind	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .

tr	Ind	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
tr	Ind	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what ' s in the draft ?
tr	Ind	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
tr	Ind	In my opinion , we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached .
tr	Ind	Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
tr	Ind	Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a unit by unit basis in a given project .
tr	Ind	Look forward to drinking a few beers .
tr	Ind	Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard .
tr	Ind	Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph .
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , when she gets in an elevator , it HAS to go down .
tr	Ind	Yo mama ` s so fat , she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth .
tr	Ind	Expect a call from Paul tonight .
tr	Ind	He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality .
tr	Ind	Just a reminder to send me a currency report .
tr	Ind	He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then .
tr	Ind	I didn ' t get a chance to talk to Paul today .
tr	Ind	Give him a call tommorow .
tr	Ind	Will you please run a June NX3 / NX1 for our book .
tr	Ind	Dan is really smart and a hard worker .
tr	Ind	I think he would be a good fit .
tr	Ind	Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss ( gone to Kelowna golfing for the weekend ).
tr	Ind	I haven ' t had a chance to send it yet .
tr	Ind	Are you guys still looking for an analyst ?
tr	Ind	Attached is a forecast for the rest of the summer for the X ( NWP and PGT ).
tr	Ind	We should try to have a conference call with the west desk to discuss as soon as we can .
tr	Ind	Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle ' s help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
tr	Ind	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation ( big dance that she and I are committed to help with ), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion .
tr	Ind	I believe that these are three weekends in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th .
tr	Ind	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
tr	Ind	She said a shower would be grand .
tr	Ind	Should we set a date now ?
tr	Ind	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Ind	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John ' s name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent )?
tr	Ind	With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .
tr	Ind	Finally , a question regarding timing .
tr	Ind	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
tr	Ind	Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
tr	Ind	Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is .
tr	Ind	You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
tr	Ind	Does she have any interest in meeting one - on - one or is she just looking for a public hanging ?
tr	Ind	At this point , our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems .
tr	Ind	WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
tr	Ind	HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous .
tr	Ind	HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .
tr	Ind	Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e - mail ).
tr	Ind	Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we can ' t and where they are ?
tr	Ind	Paul Kaufman has asked me to set a conference call to review the FERC Meeting that was held Thursday , Nov . 9th .
tr	Ind	Did you do a deal with National Fuel Marketing purchasing 3 , 500 mmbtu on May 30th @ 2 . 975 ?
tr	Ind	They are invoicing for this and I don ' t have an invoice for it .
tr	Ind	I was issued a new corporate American Express card .

tr	Ind	Did she ever go to a real doctor ?
tr	Ind	YesShe is having physical theraphy 3 times a week .
tr	Ind	I haven ' t seen her for a couple of weeks and have only talked to her .
tr	Ind	Jared just told me you have a BUNCH of stuff on your plate and I think you are about to get much busier too .
tr	Ind	Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself ?
tr	Ind	No transportation at this point , just a tabs .
tr	Ind	Per our conversation a few minutes ago , attached please find the revised Stipulation .
tr	Ind	A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world .
tr	Ind	Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War .
tr	Ind	I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT GOING ON WITH YOU AND THE LITTLE WOMAN .
tr	Ind	YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOU PLATE , DAD .
tr	Ind	"We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "" wish list "" for us ."
tr	Ind	In all , we received requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event .
tr	Ind	We thought you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting , so we ' ve provided a sampling of the suggestions below .
tr	Ind	Everybody needs a little help now and then , even eSpeak .
tr	Ind	Those requests should be somewhat easier to meet , although scheduling time with some of our colleagues can be quite a task !
tr	Ind	Friday is a bad day ( Performance Review Committee all day ).
tr	Ind	I will have to leave downtown at about 945 to catch a plane .
tr	Ind	A correction .
tr	Ind	I shall spend an entire day at PRC ( performance review ) on Friday , July 7 .
tr	Ind	How about a pre - meeting web site cruise on Friday , July 7 at 11AM EDT ?
tr	Ind	How about a pre - meeting web site cruise on Friday , July 7 at 11AM EDT ?
tr	Ind	Talk about a shotgun marriage !
tr	Ind	I can ' t give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password .
tr	Ind	It ' s a very ambitious site -- with state - of - the - art WSI weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL .
tr	Ind	Have a great weekend .
tr	Ind	Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold .
tr	Ind	a few things regading the POA / Cargill line ..
tr	Ind	We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line , putting us over the limit , without me knowing ...
tr	Ind	Attached for your review is a blacklined version of the : ( a ) Schedule and ( b ) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Master Agreement .
tr	Ind	""" Other Provisions : On each Payment Date , [ ENA ] shall pay [ a fee of ] [ an amount equal to ] USD { 38 , 000 ?], which amount shall be subject to the netting provisions of the [ Master Agreement - how do you refer to the agreement ?]"""
tr	Ind	I didn ' t have a chance to speak with you after the offsite to shake your hand .
tr	Ind	"A currency Transaction with Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited ("" EEFTL "") as agent for Risk Management & Trading Corp . under which either ( A ) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from EEFTL , Counterparty shall receive the Base Currency Amount and shall pay the Foreign Currency Amount , or ( B ) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to sell to EEFTL , Counterparty shall pay the Base Currency Amount and shall receive the Foreign Currency Amount ."

tr	Ind	I have a change in plans next week .
tr	Ind	I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information regarding some of the titles for various employees .
tr	Ind	Also attached is a sample availability provision ( actually 2 different versions ).
tr	Ind	I ' m forwarding a revised development agreement term sheet , showing revisions from your original version .
tr	Ind	Our project manager ( Scott Laidlaw ) and engineer ( Harry Okabayashi ) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work .
tr	Ind	I now understand that someone at ENA / Enron Mexico / Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC contract with ABB for this project .
tr	Ind	As I watched my mother and father ' s health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die , it is a very defining time in our lives .
tr	Ind	He is joining an excellent company .
tr	Ind	I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA .
tr	Ind	As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable , it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can .
tr	Ind	They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires .
tr	Ind	It was a 7 lb ., 10 oz ., 20 inch little boy .
tr	Ind	So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
tr	Ind	They are a great deal of fun .
tr	Ind	I hope you have a great summer .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , Mr . Lay will be in San Jose , CA participating in a conference , where he is a speaker , on June 14 .
tr	Ind	Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation to a reception which they are hosting on Wed . 6 / 14 at 5 : 00 PM to be held at the Houston Petroleum Club .
tr	Ind	This is o . k . for Ken Lay , but we are changing to a more uniform address , so would likely be better to use kenneth . lay @ enron . com .
tr	Ind	"This is a "" test email send "" of the WPO Forum Group from Richard Everett ."
tr	Ind	Actually it is not a new truck .
tr	Ind	I spoke with Gerald and he said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad ' s place .
tr	Ind	I had a couple of hickies on my neck the day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns .
tr	Ind	She is going to be a kinesiologist , sports injury therapist .
tr	Ind	Oh , Jeff Sherrar has a new book out .
tr	Ind	I understand you have a brand new truck .
tr	Ind	Last thing , send me a million dollars , I ' m tired of working .
tr	Ind	Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months ?
tr	Ind	Please do me a favour and give me the subject price for Jan , Feb , Mar and Apr 2001 .
tr	Ind	I have a fax machine at home , though , if you prefer .
tr	Ind	However , he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron ' s interests .
tr	Ind	1 ) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2 ) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement .
tr	Ind	Plus , I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that , instead of having a lawyer she hasn ' t dealt with initial it .

tr	Ind	We had a nice Thanksgiving here too .
tr	Ind	"We played a new version of Uno called "" African Uno "" that was complex , fast and at times , physically challenging ."
tr	Ind	It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
tr	Ind	They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don ' t want 3 people in that small apartment .
tr	Ind	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Ind	But , I guess , it ' s a start ...
tr	Ind	"I don ' t understand , what do you mean by "" log in an email ""?"
tr	Ind	Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving , I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I ' ve ever had ( I not gonna tell them that , I don ' t want them getting swell heads ).
tr	Ind	Ma said she had a great time in Houston , She was happy to see yourself , as well as C & D .
tr	Ind	Hey , Mr . Computer , you can ' t log an email in to your sister ?!
tr	Ind	Our concern is that we don ' t want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component .
tr	Ind	can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of .
tr	Ind	Sorry I haven ' t written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated .
tr	Ind	But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
tr	Ind	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Ind	Haven ' t heard from you in a while .
tr	Ind	A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul .
tr	Ind	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Ind	As a result of that , she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me ( The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia ).
tr	Ind	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they ' d make a good match ?
tr	Ind	She ' s a very fun girl .
tr	Ind	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Ind	I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
tr	Ind	I ' ll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
tr	Ind	This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire .
tr	Ind	Have a good weekend .
tr	Ind	This e - mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential .
tr	Ind	I think they ' ll send us another update once he ' s out of emergency and into a room .?
tr	Ind	Then it ' s real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number .? The address is below .?
tr	Ind	Bobby is a member of a bicycle team , while cycling this weekend , he and other members of his team were injured by a truck .?
tr	Ind	An update will be e - mailed , as soon as one is available .
tr	Ind	I think it ' s a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ).
tr	Ind	We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages ( like the homepage ).
tr	Ind	Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires ?
tr	Ind	We would like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually .
tr	Ind	If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
tr	Ind	We should include ISDA energy definitions , CFTC matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in North America .
tr	Ind	I might also add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power trading form .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , I can ' t forward your message to him directly ( there seems to be a problem with the attachment ).
tr	Ind	Enclosed is a worksheet for Ineos Acrylics .
tr	Ind	Ineos is an English company which has a majority of its operations in the US .
tr	Ind	Please deliver a copy to me as well .
tr	Ind	Have a great weekend .
tr	Ind	I left you a voice mail on Friday .
tr	Ind	Could you please send an executable version of the contract to Fred , David , John and me tomorrow ?
tr	Ind	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call .
tr	Ind	Turn up your sound a bit .
tr	Ind	Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size , and that Mom is doing well .
tr	Ind	Hope you ' ve been storing up sleep , cause it looks like you won ' t be getting much for a while .
tr	Ind	These three little ones don ' t realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad , but I ' m sure they ' ll find out soon .
tr	Ind	I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts .
tr	Ind	Turn up your sound a bit .
tr	Ind	Attached are an original and blacklined copy of your form of guaranty , which reflect our comments .
tr	Ind	Did you get a chance to find those GTC ' s for ENA that you can forward this way ?
tr	Ind	Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end )?
tr	Ind	Evidently , this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now .
tr	Ind	There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value .
tr	Ind	I believe that there might be a sign - flipping problem for PUTS that ' s causing this whole issue .

tr	Ind	Kindly confirm your availability to attend an Analyst and Associate Recruiting Meeting scheduled for Thursday , July 26th at 2 : 00 p . m . ( 4 : 00 p . m . Toronto time ).
tr	Ind	I propose we have a conference call with Bob Fagan on Fri July 20 at 1 : 00 pm Calgary time to discuss any areas of concern / confusion you may have .
tr	Ind	I ' ve also included a redlined draft showing changes .
tr	Ind	With reference to Article 5 , section 5 . 1 ( b ), are we going to propose an alternative planned outage to TAU for next year ?
tr	Ind	IEP will be hosting a dinner for California Governor Gray Davis on Thursday , December 7 , 2000 at the historic Julia Morgan House in Sacramento .
tr	Ind	A formal invitation will follow to those who respond .
tr	Ind	Seems like a good idea to keep the heat on Hoecker & Co . right up until Nov . 1 .
tr	Ind	FYI , we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with Sue and Robbie et al .
tr	Ind	We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues , case law and MSA self - certification language , and let me know if you have additional items .

tr	Ind	A reconciling difference of $ 15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p & l as generated on the AS400 .
tr	Ind	However , this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p & l values with traders .

tr	Ind	What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra - day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols )?
tr	Ind	"We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "" assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses "" associated with the manual system ."
tr	Ind	That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS , but it that ' s what they are saying , let me know and we can figure out a solution .
tr	Ind	My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC ' s online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC ' s peak load periods .
tr	Ind	Good point , but I ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .

tr	Ind	Thank you for your patience and I hope you can take a few moments to enjoy the holidays .
tr	Ind	As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
tr	Ind	* Offers a 7 . 5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
tr	Ind	* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3 . 5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
tr	Ind	* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *
tr	Ind	* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *
tr	Ind	This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG & E ' s headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
tr	Ind	This is to inform that a representative of Enron Corp would like to address the Commission on the issue of utility rate stabilization plans at the Commission ' s hearings scheduled for December 27th and 28th .
tr	Ind	Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission ' s hearings .
tr	Ind	Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission ' s hearings .
tr	Ind	Going to be a wild ride .
tr	Ind	That ' s a very good point .
tr	Ind	"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
tr	Ind	Harry also had a good comment --- don ' t specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
tr	Ind	This is a request for your interview participation .
tr	Ind	have you gotten a price ?
tr	Ind	They are currently working on a bid ( due 1 / 31 ) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy ( operator ), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
tr	Ind	Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25 - 27 API Gravity and 1 . 5 - 2 . 0 % sulfur .
tr	Ind	Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon ' s West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
tr	Ind	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Ind	Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?
tr	Ind	we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .
tr	Ind	seems like a 5 second decision to me .
tr	Ind	That girl ' s mother sounds like a real problem .
tr	Ind	Here ' s a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7 : 35am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I ' d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
tr	Ind	A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her , but I couldn ' t do it .
tr	Ind	This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick reactions and favourable market movements .
tr	Ind	Not bad for a single cargo .
tr	Ind	1 . In Section 1 . 1 , there should be a parentheses after etc . in the 5th line .
tr	Ind	Also , add a semicolon at the end of clause ( i ).
tr	Ind	10 . In Collateral Requests , insert a comma after deposit in the last line .
tr	Ind	11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I ' m not sure exists .
tr	Ind	13 . In UCC / Disclaimer of warranties , add a clause ( c ).
tr	Ind	Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
tr	Ind	"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers ."
tr	Ind	If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
tr	Ind	"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs )."
tr	Ind	"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ..."
tr	Ind	Just let me know and I can send you a new attachment .
tr	Ind	I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft .
tr	Ind	It is a fairly standard , fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar .
tr	Ind	"You will notice that Questar has requested a "" Payment Plan "" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events ."
tr	Ind	After execution , we will forward a final copy to you for your files .
tr	Ind	Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts / materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in - service date of May 1 .
tr	Ind	Has a location , Theirs or TW land / ROW , been settled and when is the required in - service date ?

tr	Ind	I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed ( I don ' t remember if you were there or not ) but I ' m thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great , thanks !
tr	Ind	We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page , we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers .

tr	Ind	We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone .

tr	Ind	Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts / materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in - service date of May 1 .

tr	Ind	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California ' s energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices .
tr	Ind	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Ind	""" It was an emergency ,"" Fishman said ."
tr	Ind	What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .
tr	Ind	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they couldn ' t make a profit even under these constraints .
tr	Ind	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO records show .
tr	Ind	Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .
tr	Ind	"We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund ."""
tr	Ind	""" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark ,'' Hoecker said ."
tr	Ind	I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA ( for customers already on DA ).
tr	Ind	"I suggest a "" blind draw "" on the teams , best ball not scramble on the golf , and as for the wager , no emails from the losing team for one week !"
tr	Ind	As I recall , Montavano , Shapiro and I usually make up one team , but I ' m willing to switch around a bit .
tr	Ind	It ' s a two way street , of course .
tr	Ind	There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation , but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show .
tr	Ind	If I can get a few minutes with Mark H . today , I ' m going to propose that I speak to Stan Klimberg about getting this signed before Thursday ' s meeting with LIPA .
tr	Ind	It settled anyway , a long time ago .
tr	Ind	Please give me a call if you would like to discuss .

tr	Ind	Marriage is , in and of itself , a noble concept , but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck .
tr	Ind	How can I say such an abomination , ask you ?
tr	Ind	And this is a direct result of the Politically correct , permissive , time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this .
tr	Ind	"Stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to "" get a break "" ."
tr	Ind	You made a choice to be a mommy , you dont get a break until they move out , thats the choice that you madea and that ' s life .
tr	Ind	But supporters are pointing a few good things out :
tr	Ind	A few weeks ago , shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry .
tr	Ind	One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed .
tr	Ind	"In George Orwell ' s influential novel "" 1984 "" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "" war is peace ""."
tr	Ind	I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body , mind and soul .
tr	Ind	When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do , not only are they hurting us , but they are hurting themselves .
tr	Ind	No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier , we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality .
tr	Ind	Will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard ?
tr	Ind	Whether you are looking for a part - time income to help pay off your debts or you are looking for the freedom offered by working from home on a full time basis , Agel is the vehicle that can make that happen .
tr	Ind	Agel is a new company and is uniquely positioned to be the next giant in the network marketing industry .

tr	Ind	It is a psycho - spiritual exercise and benefiting the mind by developing stamina and strength .
tr	Ind	It can ward off and cure a number of diseases , keeps the body youthful and enables an easy delivery in childbirth .

tr	Ind	Dr . Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que ., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two friends who were being mauled .
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
tr	Ind	""" A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear ' s paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling ."""
tr	Ind	Dr . Fortier threw a large rock at the bear , distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , who was in the same tent .
tr	Ind	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr . Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr . Fortier said .
tr	Ind	U . S . industrialist Andrew Carnegie started a hero fund in 1904 after being inspired by rescue stories from a mine disaster that killed 181 people .
tr	Ind	He was three months late in filing a name for the business , and he threatened to call his company Apple Computers if the other colleagues didn ' t suggest a better name by 5 O ' clock .
tr	Ind	It is not an acronym as popularly believed .
tr	Ind	This name was formed by using COMp , for computer , and PAQ to denote a small integral object .
tr	Ind	It was originally named ' Googol ', a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 zeros .
tr	Ind	After founders - Stanford graduate students Sergey Brin and Larry Page presented their project to an angel investor , they received a cheque made out to ' Google '
tr	Ind	Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tossed a coin to decidewhether the company they founded would be called Hewlett - Packard or Packard - Hewlett .
tr	Ind	Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore wanted to name their new company ' Moore Noyce ' but that was already trademarked by a hotel chain so they had to settle for an acronym of INTegrated ELectronics .

tr	Ind	I ' m nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions .
tr	Ind	Anyone know a release date ?
tr	Ind	Anyway , I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I missed out on 2 / 3 weekend events .

tr	Ind	Also , from their own webpage , reasons why NASA is important , in a 5th grade format .
tr	Ind	Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently , crossed a modern bridge , flown in an airplane , recieved any form of modern medicine , did any mathematics , drove a car , used a cellular phone , etc . then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us .
tr	Ind	Also NASA has a large outreach program for education , some people believe this is important .

tr	Ind	i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers ' money , but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies , that i find it best not to think about it .
tr	Ind	of course , in a perfect world , tax payers ' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program , and housing for the homeless , but this is far from a perfect world .

tr	Ind	An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China ' s soaring economic growth .
tr	Ind	Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol
tr	Ind	A week before , China ' s second biggest state oil firm had signed a $ 70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran , which already supplies 13 per cent of China ' s needs .
tr	Ind	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Ind	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Ind	Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .
tr	Ind	Japan favoured a route to the sea , enabling oil to be shipped to both Japan and China .
tr	Ind	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Ind	""" Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world ,"" he said ."
tr	Ind	""" It may be a difficult political issue but I don ' t think the energy content is worthwhile ."""
tr	Ind	Eurasia Group , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price .

tr	Ind	Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
tr	Ind	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Ind	Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
tr	Ind	Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the air flowing through your nostrils .
tr	Ind	Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
tr	Ind	Yet , there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness .
tr	Ind	You are in a state of peace and relaxation .
tr	Ind	A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
tr	Ind	Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .
tr	Ind	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Ind	Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process .
tr	Ind	You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity .
tr	Ind	Well maybe a miracle could happen , but lets face it we ' re ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !
tr	Ind	Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same - gender couples .
tr	Ind	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real need for visible support for the “ pro - same - gender - marriage ” side of this issue .
tr	Ind	We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
tr	Ind	"This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "" secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity .”"
tr	Ind	However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
tr	Ind	Likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Ind	As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .
tr	Ind	A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http :// loveallpeople . org / usconstitutiona . txt
tr	Ind	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Ind	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Ind	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Ind	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Ind	"There is an old saying that applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure ."""
tr	Ind	Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
tr	Ind	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Ind	"But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President ."
tr	Ind	NASA & Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing Hoax a secret in modern times

tr	Ind	This is really an end goal aim of NASA & Company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon landing hoax .
tr	Ind	A pair of military pilots embarked on China ' s second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days .
tr	Ind	Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .

tr	Ind	I ' m a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
tr	Ind	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Ind	I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
tr	Ind	Subject : Civet Cats , James Rachels + a song
tr	Ind	""" As an example , consider the treatment of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal ."

tr	Ind	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Ind	This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .

tr	Ind	Attack on Iran : A Looming Folly
tr	Ind	An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order .
tr	Ind	In essence , Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government .
tr	Ind	Iraq , already a seething cauldron , will sink further into chaos .
tr	Ind	"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran "" has some 540 , 000 men under arms and over 350 , 000 reserves ."
tr	Ind	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Ind	"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."
tr	Ind	"In February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" challenges and threats "" in the region ."
tr	Ind	This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America ' s condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus .
tr	Ind	An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact , and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces .
tr	Ind	Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel ' s overwhelming capabilities .
tr	Ind	As of 2002 , Syria had some 215 , 000 soldiers under arms , 4 , 700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability .
tr	Ind	Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
tr	Ind	This threat exists not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .
tr	Ind	More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .

tr	Ind	Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .
tr	Ind	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .
tr	Ind	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Ind	What manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course ?
tr	Ind	What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran , and from the diversion of attention to that attack ?
tr	Ind	Is any of this a probability ?

tr	Ind	Merrist Wood ( I ' m there on a NVQ equine course ) do HND in equine management .
tr	Ind	Your best bet is to look on UCAS and do a course search .
tr	Ind	They ' ll give you a comprehensive list of all the universities that do the courses you want , plus all the information you need to apply .
tr	Ind	Would you recommend living in Limerick as a student ?
tr	Ind	and would you recommend it as a student ?
tr	Ind	Limerick ' s a great student city , there ' s loads on , you ' ll be spoilt for choice .
tr	Ind	Limerick is such a full city , shopping , night life , career choices , social choices , I came here about 12 years ago for college ..... and Orla got it spot on , I haven ' t left , nor would I .
tr	Ind	Also you could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake .
tr	Ind	Or you could just use a home screen launcher replacement .
tr	Ind	As a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom .

tr	Ind	just want to ask .. i have an nikon dslr .. im wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200 - 300percent .. i can see some dead pixel ... is there something wrong with my camera body ?
tr	Ind	Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
tr	Ind	There should be a Pixel Mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them , most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels , some only show up on long exposures .
tr	Ind	If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can ' t find something in your own field .
tr	Ind	Your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector .
tr	Ind	It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa .

tr	Ind	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Ind	A common one is arsenic and there really isn ' t a way to cure that .
tr	Ind	A quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it ' s head .
tr	Ind	So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend .
tr	Ind	I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture .
tr	Ind	1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
tr	Ind	( like VERY not in a good way )
tr	Ind	3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?
tr	Ind	taking young cat with me for a week out of state ?
tr	Ind	i have a 3 - 4 month old kitten and i live in forida .
tr	Ind	i am going to my grandmas in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia .
tr	Ind	My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside .
tr	Ind	she is also good in a carrier .
tr	Ind	if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside ?
tr	Ind	But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ).
tr	Ind	He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
tr	Ind	Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don ' t require cleaner .
tr	Ind	If you must use a cleaner , pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated .
tr	Ind	I have had parakeets for a VERY long time , and I use pledge .
tr	Ind	Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate .
tr	Ind	Even a cotton cloth ( I like diapers ) that is barely damp w water will work fine .

tr	Ind	can i buy a laptop in u . k and then take it to rep . ireland and put a irish pay , go dongle init ?
tr	Ind	i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
tr	Ind	There won ' t be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital .
tr	Ind	But word of advice if you ' re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
tr	Ind	just a heads up .
tr	Ind	I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
tr	Ind	some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes
tr	Ind	I have a question about McDonald ' s Monopoly !
tr	Ind	bit of a stupid question but do the spikes / spines ( whatever you call them ) on their side and face area ever go hard .
tr	Ind	they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i wouldnt .
tr	Ind	they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :)
tr	Ind	They just are there as an adaptation .
tr	Ind	what is a kimberwick bit used for ?
tr	Ind	Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking , hunting and doing cross country .
tr	Ind	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Ind	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Ind	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Ind	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Ind	How long to save up for a canon t3i ?

tr	Ind	If you can ' t even do basic math , you ' ll never figure out how to use a DSLR camera properly .
tr	Ind	its for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
tr	Ind	"took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ("" the way you would icing "") to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "" mud """
tr	Ind	For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm # LGGOBPROJ
tr	Ind	I ' m getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it ?
tr	Ind	I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn ' t use it -
tr	Ind	a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet !
tr	Ind	In Calcutta there is a Foreigner ' s reservation office where they speak English very well .
tr	Ind	They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones ?
tr	Ind	You might end up as a no show passenger .
tr	Ind	my name is Josalyn Leainne Creek and i ' m 19 years old and i graduated from high in May adn of this year and i love animals and i ' m great at working and i had drama in my last job which was mcallister ' s deli and i ', a mormon and i hvae changed to be a better person that pwople are wanting to hirier and i ' m willing to work whenever you need me but i go to church on every sunday and i have a doctor ' s appointment this thursday at 2 ; 30 and i hope you h = guys hirier me because i work very hard and i dont care about how much you guys pay and i ' ve been looking for a job ever since i have graduated and i hate drama
tr	Ind	It makes a huge difference .
tr	Ind	No one ' s going to hire you if you can ' t even spell , especially if you ' re a high school graduate .
tr	Ind	I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada , I received one that is valid until October of 2015 .
tr	Ind	How Do you Prevent A Dwarf Hamster Escaping From The Cage ?
tr	Ind	Im getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT !!!
tr	Ind	would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it cant escape i can buy it a wheel
tr	Ind	I ' ve never had a dwarf hamster but I ' ve had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it can ' t out .
tr	Ind	Yes I ' ve had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good
tr	Ind	Aquiriums are good also , but provide a mesh top for an easy airway .
tr	Ind	I want to go all over :) I don ' t have a set route yet .
tr	Ind	Get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket .
tr	Ind	I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
tr	Ind	And her last name , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?
tr	Ind	"In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named "" first name "" according to that of their fathers ."
tr	Ind	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Ind	She is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
tr	Ind	I have a splitter / filter between my ADSL and ph line ?
tr	Ind	You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks , except the one which the DSL modem connects .
tr	Ind	Do you just take a changing bag with you ?
tr	Ind	Well a changing bag would be the easiest solution .
tr	Ind	It ' s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you ' re outside .
tr	Ind	A changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag .
tr	Ind	A film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field .
tr	Ind	I have a few how to videos for DIY 35mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel :
tr	Ind	I ' ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David .
tr	Ind	no , it ' s only a body of a young man
tr	Ind	"An art teacher in the mid - cities area of Dallas / Ft . Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw "" nudes "" in the museum ."
tr	Ind	I am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak .
tr	Ind	We are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so I wanted something close .
tr	Ind	Anyway , have a lovely first anniversary !
tr	Ind	HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?
tr	Ind	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Ind	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
tr	Ind	It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
tr	Ind	If you ' re going to Seoul , then you should also visit a specific place called , ' The Namsan Tower '!
tr	Ind	It ' s a really huge place over there , and so many visitors / foreigners went to put chains and locks over there !
tr	Ind	( An outside water park !)
tr	Ind	an island called jejudo / jeju island
tr	Ind	I found an injured pure white bird ( dove I guess ?)
tr	Ind	It ' s pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I don ' t know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
tr	Ind	Doves are a species of pigeon , they are Seed eaters , they do not eat bread , or worms .
tr	Ind	make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
tr	Ind	as they can drink a lot .
tr	Ind	like a little container .
tr	Ind	If you have a pet store near buy some wheat , pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do , but do not feed bread .
tr	Ind	Buy a ticket for Paris .
tr	Ind	Buy a ticket from the driver .
tr	Ind	It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
tr	Ind	Create a new layer and fill the later with black .
tr	Ind	But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if your on a macbook theres aperture :)
tr	Ind	"depends what you want from "" B & W ""... many programs will use a generic B & W ..."
tr	Ind	Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation .
tr	Ind	Maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced !
tr	Ind	When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food .
tr	Ind	There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods .
tr	Ind	Even if you mash it with a spoon he can ' t do that ,
tr	Ind	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Ind	If you took some Olympic - level horses on a trail ride , they just couldn ' t do it .
tr	Ind	It doesn ' t matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
tr	Ind	Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good .
tr	Ind	Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
tr	Ind	Same , when I ' m galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything .
tr	Ind	I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand .
tr	Ind	I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1 . 024 .

tr	Ind	I also have a powerhead , getting another soon .
tr	Ind	I have a few questions , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
tr	Ind	How would I need to set a sump for this 10 gallon ?
tr	Ind	Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?
tr	Ind	I don ' t want an iPad or Kindle .
tr	Ind	I just want an e - reader that does a little bit more than just read .
tr	Ind	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Ind	Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
tr	Ind	Hey there , I ' m trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday .
tr	Ind	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Ind	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Ind	We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I ' m not an expert on the area .
tr	Ind	A little help is always great . =)
tr	Ind	"Go to a local market or drug store , and buy this month ' s copy of the "" Philadelphia Magazine ""."
tr	Ind	Wishing your husband a happy birthday !
tr	Ind	If you ' re looking for a good burger , some great fries ( they are too die for !), and good drinks , go to Chickie & Pete ' s !
tr	Ind	How to start a new fish tank ?
tr	Ind	I ' m getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
tr	Ind	I ' m still a beginner .
tr	Ind	Newer semi - automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft .
tr	Ind	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Ind	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Ind	If your ( US ) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company , you texts and calls will go through .
tr	Ind	They will , however , cost a bunch .
tr	Ind	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Ind	You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada .
tr	Ind	Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection .
tr	Ind	$ ometime $ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $ involved what $ ome of your money .
tr	Ind	So now i wanted to bouild up relationship with him so i got a piece of carrot and i put it on my hand , i moved very slowly and he suddenly run away to his tube .
tr	Ind	He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit .
tr	Ind	Is Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
tr	Ind	My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years .
tr	Ind	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Ind	... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
tr	Ind	I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
tr	Ind	And now they are finishing a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only !
tr	Ind	Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
tr	Ind	I ' m a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
tr	Ind	No matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
tr	Ind	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Ind	Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don ' t plan on making another one for a while .
tr	Ind	I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don ' t know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
tr	Ind	My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill .
tr	Ind	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Ind	I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
tr	Ind	At 18 years , your cat has had a long life .
tr	Ind	By comparison , outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment .
tr	Ind	According to a couple sources , the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon , England who reportedly live to the age of 36 .
tr	Ind	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Ind	Anything after 12 is a bonus .
tr	Ind	A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you .
tr	Ind	"Eating by his cage and keeping a "" sleep cage "" in your room is a good idea ."
tr	Ind	Keep his cage open and go on your computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
tr	Ind	he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .

tr	Ind	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Ind	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Ind	maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
tr	Ind	yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way , hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
tr	Ind	Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
tr	Ind	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Ind	These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
tr	Ind	is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
tr	Ind	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Ind	i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
tr	Ind	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it

tr	Ind	Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
tr	Ind	Go to a sumo tournament .
tr	Ind	Eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
tr	Ind	You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
tr	Ind	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Ind	It ' s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
tr	Ind	You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
tr	Ind	Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa .
tr	Ind	Naha ' s not a very big city .
tr	Ind	I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model , and in the game it ' s 3 - shot burst .
tr	Ind	2 ) did Vietnam m16 ' s have a 3 - shot burst function ?
tr	Ind	As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming .
tr	Ind	Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you ' ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
tr	Ind	In case of an earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and don ' t go outside as possible debris will fall .

tr	Ind	"So don ' t be afraid to get something a little bigger than "" perfect "" just in case you hit a growth spurt ."
tr	Ind	A taller horse doesn ' t always mean a horse you can ' t handle .

tr	Ind	If you Don ' t want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
tr	Ind	For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls .
tr	Ind	London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
tr	Ind	You will be able to have a good time there .
tr	Ind	"I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal ( apparently this is "" washing down "" your food "") and not ordering wine ."
tr	Ind	You ' ll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
tr	Ind	However , if you ' re allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
tr	Ind	If your French is good / moderate , then head to Paris without a doubt .
tr	Ind	I also highly recommend staying with a French family .

tr	Ind	"There is no such thing as a BTA or "" Basic Travel Allowance ""- this is 100 % a scam - as the first poster said , cut off any and all contact with this person - they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be ."
tr	Ind	i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
tr	Ind	First you need a compatible pair .
tr	Ind	Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed .
tr	Ind	I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
tr	Ind	Recently she has been peeing A LOT .
tr	Ind	Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
tr	Ind	But your cat is passing a LOT of urine , and this is bad .
tr	Ind	Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
tr	Ind	"You should check for updated information on a regular basis ."""
tr	Ind	But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident .
tr	Ind	So keep checking at least on a weekly basis .
tr	Ind	GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http :// www . canadavisa . com / canadian - immigration - faq - skilled - workers . html .
tr	Ind	"Your application is still evaluated on a number of criteria , not all of them as "" cast in steel "" as the points ."
tr	Ind	"Why have a "" minimum "" if it is going to be ignored ?"
tr	Ind	Alright , so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it .
tr	Ind	( I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again ) so I fineally checked it , and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida !!!
tr	Ind	We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days .
tr	Ind	and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places , i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go . : D
tr	Ind	Enjoy it while you can , and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time .
tr	Ind	Hope you have a crapload of fun !
tr	Ind	( In a good way ...)
tr	Ind	Have a look at this , it may help .
tr	Ind	I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
tr	Ind	I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitors visa .
tr	Ind	do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
tr	Ind	i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country .
tr	Ind	An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
tr	Ind	I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U . K .
tr	Ind	You should be fine with just a passport , unless you ' re staying longer than six months .
tr	Ind	You ' ll have a great time , so no worries there .
tr	Ind	What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
tr	Ind	i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
tr	Ind	A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred * mutt * chicken .
tr	Ind	There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
tr	Ind	All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
tr	Ind	Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
tr	Ind	Crest : Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene .
tr	Ind	So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .
tr	Ind	Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
tr	Ind	deleting a question where you dont like the answer won ' t get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
tr	Ind	Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I dont think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
tr	Ind	Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements .
tr	Ind	I ' ve had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I didn ' t notice at first .
tr	Ind	In all my travels I ’ ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
tr	Ind	After a person dies , their remains are “ waked ” in their home for roughly 2 - 3days .
tr	Ind	Another unique custom ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
tr	Ind	Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
tr	Ind	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Ind	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Ind	I ' m unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn ' t react to seeing another cat on TV .
tr	Ind	I heard that a company ( here is a link : http :// news . yahoo . com / nestl - purina - releases - commercial - aimed - dogs - 183443091 . html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans can ' t hear .
tr	Ind	If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
tr	Ind	Although , I don ' t think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they ' ll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
tr	Ind	Well , T . V . is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture .
tr	Ind	To a dog , watching T . V . is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80Hz .
tr	Ind	Hearing is a dog ’ s secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
tr	Ind	If they ask how much I ' m willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
tr	Ind	I saw a site that charges $ 0 . 70 per mile .
tr	Ind	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Ind	I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
tr	Ind	I want to take a cruise around the world .
tr	Ind	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Ind	1 . Here ' s a site that lists world cruises including prices .
tr	Ind	"Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high "" single supplement "" costs in addition ."
tr	Ind	( Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone .
tr	Ind	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Ind	There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China , there were lots of Japanese who ' d been displaced during WWII .
tr	Ind	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Ind	It was an evolution .
tr	Ind	There has always been a Mexican - American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico .
tr	Ind	We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
tr	Ind	EDIT : My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time .
tr	Ind	I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
tr	Ind	We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
tr	Ind	There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
tr	Ind	My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
tr	Ind	yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
tr	Ind	we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
tr	Ind	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Ind	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Ind	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Ind	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Ind	Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Ind	I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Ind	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ).
tr	Ind	Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
tr	Ind	You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
tr	Ind	I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http :// www . mikegigi . com / meltmetl . htm and http :// www . mikegigi . com / firehole . htm
tr	Ind	Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
tr	Ind	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Ind	We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
tr	Ind	I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which weren ' t a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
tr	Ind	I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
tr	Ind	It will become EU law in a couple of years .
tr	Ind	If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
tr	Ind	How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python ?
tr	Ind	When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
tr	Ind	Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
tr	Ind	Once you ' ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
tr	Ind	Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
tr	Ind	My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
tr	Ind	Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
tr	Ind	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Ind	Once you ' re there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
tr	Ind	Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ).
tr	Ind	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Ind	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Ind	I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
tr	Ind	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Ind	I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
tr	Ind	Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock .
tr	Ind	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Ind	Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
tr	Ind	( Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn ' t count for at least two years .)
tr	Ind	"A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
tr	Ind	Coming to stay , and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD .
tr	Ind	You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
tr	Ind	It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
tr	Ind	You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
tr	Ind	"Being an American and from the "" south "" you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud ."
tr	Ind	I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
tr	Ind	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Ind	Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
tr	Ind	You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
tr	Ind	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Ind	Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
tr	Ind	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Ind	Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
tr	Ind	or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
tr	Ind	try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
tr	Ind	This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
tr	Ind	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Ind	I ' ve stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
tr	Ind	In Agra I ' ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
tr	Ind	Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
tr	Ind	You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
tr	Ind	a degu , a rat , a mouse , a hamster or a guinea pig ?
tr	Ind	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Ind	I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
tr	Ind	Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
tr	Ind	They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
tr	Ind	I ' ve never met a hamster that didn ' t bite me .
tr	Ind	Never had / handled a Degu .
tr	Ind	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Ind	They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
tr	Ind	My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
tr	Ind	Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated .
tr	Ind	They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
tr	Ind	They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
tr	Ind	If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , its simple to do it over the computer .
tr	Ind	You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
tr	Ind	When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital .
tr	Ind	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Ind	Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .
tr	Ind	We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
tr	Ind	Usually you can ' t go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
tr	Ind	Do you speak a foreign language ?
tr	Ind	I could spend a year in Spain alone .
tr	Ind	A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland .
tr	Ind	I ' ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
tr	Ind	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Ind	Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ' ll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you ' re there .
tr	Ind	I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
tr	Ind	Nigeria , a lovely country .
tr	Ind	More than a tourist centre .
tr	Ind	How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
tr	Ind	Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
tr	Ind	We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
tr	Ind	How could we make it settle in a new house .
tr	Ind	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Ind	you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
tr	Ind	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Ind	you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
tr	Ind	he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
tr	Ind	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Ind	in a week ' s time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
tr	Ind	let him out for half an hour , to explore .
tr	Ind	I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
tr	Ind	Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
tr	Ind	I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wont work .
tr	Ind	I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
tr	Ind	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .
tr	Ind	I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog .
tr	Ind	Maybe get a book on training .
tr	Ind	I would start with a leash .
tr	Ind	Let him walk in and out for a few days .
tr	Ind	will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
tr	Ind	I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
tr	Ind	Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
tr	Ind	I am just a satisfied customer .
tr	Ind	Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe .
tr	Ind	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Ind	If you ' re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
tr	Ind	From either of those cities , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
tr	Ind	You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
tr	Ind	PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken ' s hotel .
tr	Ind	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Ind	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Ind	He ' ll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
tr	Ind	Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
tr	Ind	We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
tr	Ind	We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
tr	Ind	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Ind	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Ind	I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
tr	Ind	Because I don ' t feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
tr	Ind	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Ind	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Ind	Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
tr	Ind	Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
tr	Ind	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Ind	Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
tr	Ind	All this will help you use both legs evenly , keep proper contact and use your wight correctly , to keep your leg in a good position .
tr	Ind	Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
tr	Ind	i wouldn ' t bother with yoga i ' d practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , theres also a way to ride on your knees ?
tr	Ind	maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i ' ve thought about getting one .
tr	Ind	You don ' t want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
tr	Ind	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Ind	He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
tr	Ind	They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
tr	Ind	My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
tr	Ind	Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc ..'
tr	Ind	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
tr	Ind	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Ind	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
tr	Ind	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
tr	Ind	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Ind	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
tr	Ind	Christiane gave you a good answer .
tr	Ind	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
tr	Ind	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Ind	True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
tr	Ind	Is there a future for our nation ' s youth ?
tr	Ind	I ' m two years into an undergraduate degree .
tr	Ind	There ' s obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc .)
tr	Ind	I ' ve also considered becoming a teacher , but it ' s not a job I ' m cut out for .
tr	Ind	I also wish I ' d applied for a scholarship .
tr	Ind	I mean , I wasn ' t smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
tr	Ind	* gasps * So I wouldn ' t make a good prostitute ?
tr	Ind	A little mellow dramatic ?
tr	Ind	I ' m studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I ' m done .
tr	Ind	I ' ve also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
tr	Ind	Try living in Sydney on a teacher ' s salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
tr	Ind	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Ind	I guess I ' m extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree .
tr	Ind	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
tr	Ind	Get an education !
tr	Ind	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it ' s not anything new .
tr	Ind	i have a baby eastern king snake .
tr	Ind	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Ind	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Ind	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Ind	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
tr	Ind	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Ind	he hasn ' t eaten in an entire month .
tr	Ind	i ' ve only tried to feed him one at a time .
tr	Ind	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Ind	Remember snakes can go awhile without eating .
tr	Ind	They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
tr	Ind	Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
tr	Ind	Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding .
tr	Ind	In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
tr	Ind	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Ind	It ' s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
tr	Ind	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Ind	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Ind	you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
tr	Ind	right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
tr	Ind	if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .
tr	Ind	"A hiss is basically a "" get the f * ck away "" sound ."
tr	Ind	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Ind	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Ind	Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
tr	Ind	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Ind	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Ind	There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
tr	Ind	I just bought a baby one yesterday .
tr	Ind	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Ind	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
tr	Ind	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Ind	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
tr	Ind	UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .
tr	Ind	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
tr	Ind	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Ind	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Ind	That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
tr	Ind	Is a finch or a parakeet better ?
tr	Ind	I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
tr	Ind	I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
tr	Ind	After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
tr	Ind	I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
tr	Ind	A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
tr	Ind	They are a big part of our family .
tr	Ind	When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
tr	Ind	Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
tr	Ind	( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
tr	Ind	If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
tr	Ind	They sometimes dont get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
tr	Ind	I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
tr	Ind	If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
tr	Ind	After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
tr	Ind	And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
tr	Ind	a parakeet is friendlier
tr	Ind	I have a parakeet named Cookie . : P
tr	Ind	Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?
tr	Ind	Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
tr	Ind	Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid - July – again , it ’ s all part of the uncertainty principle .
tr	Ind	Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
tr	Ind	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Ind	Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
tr	Ind	You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
tr	Ind	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Ind	You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
tr	Ind	If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below .
tr	Ind	( I ' ve even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer !
tr	Ind	If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .
tr	Ind	Use a well rinsed medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non - crumbly styrofoam to float them .
tr	Ind	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
tr	Ind	Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .
tr	Ind	Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .
tr	Ind	Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult ' s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
tr	Ind	If a pair isn ' t leaving eggs ... check the following :
tr	Ind	1 . Is a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the eggs ?
tr	Ind	Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .
tr	Ind	Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5 . 8 to 10 . 6 DH should be fine for gardneri .
tr	Ind	They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ).
tr	Ind	A number of minerals are not of much consequence .
tr	Ind	However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo .)
tr	Ind	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Ind	Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .
tr	Ind	Other will add a drop of Methylene blue .
tr	Ind	If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
tr	Ind	Should I get a balcony ?
tr	Ind	Any tips or advice to make this a great experience ??
tr	Ind	Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
tr	Ind	Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
tr	Ind	This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
tr	Ind	It is really an entertainment for the kids .
tr	Ind	I would suggest a warmer season , but not Spring Break or early summer .
tr	Ind	With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
tr	Ind	They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
tr	Ind	Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
tr	Ind	Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
tr	Ind	We had a ball .
tr	Ind	We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
tr	Ind	There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
tr	Ind	You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
tr	Ind	If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
tr	Ind	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Ind	If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
tr	Ind	I have known this guy for a long time , but we ' ve never been good friends or anything .
tr	Ind	He is my farrier ( shoes my horses feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
tr	Ind	""" Well , if you ever just want to see me I ' ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after ."""
tr	Ind	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Ind	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Ind	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Ind	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Ind	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Ind	It ' s a father and son business .
tr	Ind	Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
tr	Ind	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Ind	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Ind	He is a few years older than me .
tr	Ind	And they usually come out within a few days .
tr	Ind	When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby ..( for those who don ' t Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
tr	Ind	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Ind	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Ind	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Ind	This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
tr	Ind	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Ind	Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .
tr	Ind	NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .
tr	Ind	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
tr	Ind	Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well .
tr	Ind	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Ind	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Ind	I am not going to go pick up a horse I can ' t afford .
tr	Ind	I will also be having my other vet up who ' s a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
tr	Ind	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Ind	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Ind	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Ind	We ' ve had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
tr	Ind	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Ind	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Ind	You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study .
tr	Ind	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Ind	Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?
tr	Ind	West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn ' t always include a fever .
tr	Ind	You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I don ' t think I could take in a horse right now these issues .
tr	Ind	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Ind	A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .
tr	Ind	Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy ?
tr	Ind	Or a difficult birth ?
tr	Ind	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Ind	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
tr	Ind	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .
tr	Ind	Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor .

tr	Ind	Never gives a receipt .
tr	Ind	To make a order you may have to go to back of line .

tr	Ind	They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services .
tr	Ind	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
tr	Ind	A very satisfied new customer !
tr	Ind	As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
tr	Ind	Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict .
tr	Ind	T ' s has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
tr	Ind	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Ind	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Ind	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
tr	Ind	Looks like there ' s a lot of talent in this place .
tr	Ind	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Ind	I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
tr	Ind	If you ' re looking to buy a car , definitely give them a call .
tr	Ind	They have a huge inventory .
tr	Ind	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Ind	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Ind	Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
tr	Ind	As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
tr	Ind	As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
tr	Ind	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Ind	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
tr	Ind	Dr . Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
tr	Ind	Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general , Dr . Taylor was the best !
tr	Ind	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Ind	I am not a client of liquidweb . com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
tr	Ind	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you ' ll love Vetri .
tr	Ind	I ' ve been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
tr	Ind	He doesn ' t just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won ' t even notice that there ' s a camera there .
tr	Ind	My husband just got a bike there as a gift he ' s only had it a month .
tr	Ind	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Ind	But just this week a peddle broke .
tr	Ind	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
tr	Ind	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Ind	I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
tr	Ind	Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
tr	Ind	They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
tr	Ind	Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
tr	Ind	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
tr	Ind	"I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "" AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ."
tr	Ind	As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
tr	Ind	This place is a Rip - Off
tr	Ind	"I brought a car in to have the "" check engine "" light diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
tr	Ind	Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ).
tr	Ind	My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn ' t want to wait in line at Outback .
tr	Ind	What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
tr	Ind	I came in and saw Dr . Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
tr	Ind	I sent a customer of mine to you .
tr	Ind	Signs of Saltford - an excellent supplier of value for money signs and banners etc .
tr	Ind	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Ind	Hello my name is Vera and I ' m writing a review about my own counseling practice in Bellevue , WA . and in Renton WA .
tr	Ind	I am a licensed mental health counselor and I work with variety of mental health problems .
tr	Ind	I am a preferred provider with most insurance companies .
tr	Ind	If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you ' ll love this zoo .
tr	Ind	You should give her a try - it ' s worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
tr	Ind	( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
tr	Ind	$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
tr	Ind	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Ind	I ' ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
tr	Ind	Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that ' s going to be anywhere you go !
tr	Ind	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Ind	A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
tr	Ind	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Ind	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Ind	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Ind	I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
tr	Ind	really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I ' d stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
tr	Ind	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
tr	Ind	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
tr	Ind	While there wasn ' t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
tr	Ind	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Ind	Do yourself a favor , call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again ..
tr	Ind	a great vacation !
tr	Ind	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Ind	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I ' m sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
tr	Ind	OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
tr	Ind	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Ind	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Ind	I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
tr	Ind	She did a great job !
tr	Ind	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Ind	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don ' t let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
tr	Ind	I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
tr	Ind	Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
tr	Ind	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Ind	Alot .
tr	Ind	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Ind	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Ind	I normally don ' t write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one won ' t be getting my business , nor my family ' s , nor my co - workers .
tr	Ind	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Ind	I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
tr	Ind	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
tr	Ind	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Ind	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Ind	They won ' t have a second chance from me .
tr	Ind	Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle .
tr	Ind	Mr . Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
tr	Ind	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
tr	Ind	I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
tr	Ind	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Ind	""" Dr . Shady "" is a jerk ."
tr	Ind	I did not have a good experience w / Dr . Ghassemlou .
tr	Ind	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can ' t see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
tr	Ind	Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
tr	Ind	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
tr	Ind	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Ind	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Ind	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
tr	Ind	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Ind	Rate a church ?
tr	Ind	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Ind	Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure .
tr	Ind	He had a robe that was made back in the ' 60s .
tr	Ind	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Ind	ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
tr	Ind	me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
tr	Ind	i ' ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
tr	Ind	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Ind	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
tr	Ind	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Ind	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
tr	Ind	Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc . THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN ' T PAID .
tr	Ind	We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
tr	Ind	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Ind	Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that ' ll change my mind .... and a different server .
tr	Ind	i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
tr	Ind	This insurance co . Is a joke !!!
tr	Ind	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Ind	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F %# king Assh @%$ e !!!
tr	Ind	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
tr	Ind	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
tr	Ind	I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need .
tr	Ind	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Ind	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
tr	Ind	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
tr	Ind	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
tr	Ind	My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
tr	Ind	After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
tr	Ind	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
tr	Ind	But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
tr	Ind	Lucky I had a spare with me !
tr	Ind	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
tr	Ind	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
tr	Ind	College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE !
tr	Ind	Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont .
tr	Ind	They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
tr	Ind	Don ' t go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
tr	Ind	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
tr	Ind	Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
tr	Ind	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
tr	Ind	I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
tr	Ind	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren ' t the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
tr	Ind	I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
tr	Ind	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
tr	Ind	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Ind	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Ind	( But this is a certified car from a dealer .)
tr	Ind	My dental surgeon , Dr . Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
tr	Ind	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Ind	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Ind	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Ind	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
tr	Ind	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Ind	After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner .
tr	Ind	After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
tr	Ind	This was a less than impressive experience at Trio ' s .
tr	Ind	Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software .
tr	Ind	We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
tr	Ind	Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
tr	Ind	Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time .
tr	Ind	On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
tr	Ind	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
tr	Ind	I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
tr	Ind	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
tr	Ind	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
tr	Ind	None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
tr	Ind	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Ind	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Ind	( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...)
tr	Ind	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9 : 30am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
tr	Ind	Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we didn ' t mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
tr	Ind	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Ind	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever its like driving a new car .
tr	Ind	I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
tr	Ind	All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
tr	Ind	After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , its less dry & smoother !
tr	Ind	I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!!!
tr	Ind	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Ind	A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
tr	Ind	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife ' s work and towed it back to fix it .
tr	Ind	I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
tr	Ind	I wonder if they were going down a hill !
tr	Ind	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
tr	Ind	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Ind	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Ind	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Ind	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
tr	Ind	My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
tr	Ind	There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
tr	Ind	As a yoga studio , I ' m sure you ' re all aware that all actions generate karma …
tr	Ind	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
tr	Ind	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Ind	Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber .
tr	Ind	We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
tr	Ind	Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !
tr	Ind	I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80 ' s , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960 ' s .
tr	Ind	They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
tr	Ind	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Ind	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Ind	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
tr	Ind	I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here .
tr	Ind	You ' d think they would do a good job but they don ' t care unless they are getting paid full price .
tr	Ind	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
tr	Ind	Then I got a bill for $ 483 . 00 .
tr	Ind	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
tr	Ind	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Ind	We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
tr	Ind	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Ind	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
tr	Ind	They recently surprised me a larger order .
tr	Ind	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
tr	Ind	They have a customer for life in us !
tr	Ind	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
tr	Ind	Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
tr	Ind	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Ind	Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
tr	Ind	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Ind	Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be .
tr	Ind	I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
tr	Ind	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
tr	Ind	On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
tr	Ind	With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chilis , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
tr	Ind	Orr ' s a nightmare !
tr	Ind	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Ind	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Ind	FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
tr	Ind	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ).
tr	Ind	Now , of course , there ' s a new building , with presumably better facilities .
tr	Ind	For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
tr	Ind	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
tr	Ind	There ' s a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
tr	Ind	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Ind	I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
tr	Ind	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
tr	Ind	Stop in and have a bite you won ' t regret it .
tr	Ind	A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
tr	Ind	I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
tr	Ind	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
tr	Ind	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Ind	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Ind	Wouldn ' t go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
tr	Ind	Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
tr	Ind	They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
tr	Ind	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Ind	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Ind	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Ind	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Ind	And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well !)
tr	Ind	I am a college student .
tr	Ind	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Ind	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend ' s aunt recommended it .
tr	Ind	An Asset to Richmond
tr	Ind	For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
tr	Ind	There ' s plenty of parking , and I ' ve never had an issue with audience members who won ' t stop talking or answering their cellphones .
tr	Ind	A great cinema in a great location .
tr	Ind	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
tr	Ind	What a history .
tr	Ind	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Ind	This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
tr	Ind	Great name for a great store !
tr	Ind	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Ind	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
tr	Ind	I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
tr	Ind	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Ind	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
tr	Ind	I ' ma regular at the HH .
tr	Ind	Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ), and don ' t go if you have a limited amount of time .
tr	Ind	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
tr	Ind	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Ind	This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
tr	Ind	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Ind	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Ind	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Ind	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Ind	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Ind	He was referred to me by a friend , who didn ' t have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
tr	Ind	I figure I would give this company a chance .
tr	Ind	However , after giving a required $ 500 . 00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
tr	Ind	We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
tr	Ind	Just curtains and a couple of accessories .
tr	Ind	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
tr	Ind	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Ind	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Ind	Imagine a hotel having problems with people .
tr	Ind	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Ind	My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
tr	Ind	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn ' t budge .
tr	Ind	I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
tr	Ind	I emailed 4 times , never a response .
tr	Ind	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
tr	Ind	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
tr	Ind	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
tr	Ind	Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
tr	Ind	So I ordered a slice .
tr	Ind	We visited on 7 / 26 / 08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia ' s on Greenfield Ave .
tr	Ind	ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
tr	Ind	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Ind	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Ind	its like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
tr	Ind	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Ind	their pizza was a little salty for me , but its still good .
tr	Ind	My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100 , 000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
tr	Ind	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Ind	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
tr	Ind	That ' s all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
tr	Ind	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
tr	Ind	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Ind	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
tr	Ind	A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
tr	Ind	Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
tr	Ind	It sucked having an SUV .
tr	Ind	If I found a spot , I couldnt fit in it .
tr	Ind	Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
tr	Ind	I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
tr	Ind	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Ind	It ' s without a doubt , the best service experience I ' ve ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville ' s price for putting on the other rear tire .
tr	Ind	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Ind	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Ind	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Ind	A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good , right ?
tr	Ind	Well , this may be an exception .
tr	Ind	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
tr	Ind	Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
tr	Ind	I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
tr	Ind	First of all , if you call for an appointment they won ' t tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
tr	Ind	"They also don ' t tell you that they ' re going to mail you an "" application "" to be admitted to be a patient ."
tr	Ind	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Ind	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
tr	Ind	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
tr	Ind	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
tr	Ind	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
tr	Ind	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
tr	Ind	"Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
tr	Ind	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Ind	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Ind	Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
tr	Ind	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
tr	Ind	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
tr	Ind	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Ind	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Ind	Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
tr	Ind	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Ind	A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
tr	Ind	"A mid - afternoon "" fire drill "" was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel ."
tr	Ind	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Ind	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
tr	Ind	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Ind	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
tr	Ind	We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
tr	Ind	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Ind	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
tr	Ind	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
tr	Ind	With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
tr	Ind	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Ind	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club ' s actual OWNER ?!
tr	Ind	I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don ' t show up , they ' ll charge you .
tr	Ind	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Ind	Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
tr	Ind	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Ind	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
tr	Ind	However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
tr	Ind	I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
tr	Ind	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Ind	I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
tr	Ind	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
tr	Ind	( They even got me a couch pretty quickly .)
tr	Ind	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Ind	If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would .
tr	Ind	No one will give me a date .
tr	Ind	How do you lose a drawer .
tr	Ind	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
tr	Ind	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Ind	Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
tr	Ind	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
tr	Ind	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Ind	My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !
tr	Ind	"To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !"
tr	Ind	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
tr	Ind	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Ind	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Ind	"PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "" all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and I will tell you that I don ' t know these people except from eating at their restaurant ."
tr	Ind	We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
tr	Ind	Dr . Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
tr	Ind	I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
tr	Ind	A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
tr	Ind	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
tr	Ind	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Ind	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Ind	But not at a risk to other people ' s pets .
tr	Ind	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Ind	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Ind	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe don ' t jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don ' t want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
tr	Ind	I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
tr	Ind	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Ind	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Ind	Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno ' s .
tr	Ind	Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
tr	Ind	"Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year !""."
tr	Ind	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
tr	Ind	I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
tr	Ind	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
tr	Ind	They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
tr	Ind	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M , no exceptions .
tr	Ind	We returned after 3PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
tr	Ind	If they think you ' ve taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1 . 50 per can .
tr	Ind	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Ind	Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that didn ' t exist .
tr	Ind	Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that didn ' t work .
tr	Ind	It ' s an entirely up and down experience , however .
tr	Ind	Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
tr	Ind	I guess that tells you a lot .
tr	Ind	Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
tr	Ind	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Ind	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Ind	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Ind	What a waste of TIME .
tr	Ind	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
tr	Ind	Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
tr	Ind	Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
tr	Ind	Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
tr	Ind	They promised it ' d be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
tr	Ind	"A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that "" I "" left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car )."
tr	Ind	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Ind	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Ind	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
va	Def	From the AP comes this story :
va	Def	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .
va	Def	The sheikh in wheel - chair has been attacked with a F - 16 - launched bomb .
va	Def	He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they didn ' t .
va	Def	In the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station , killing several people .
va	Def	The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe .
va	Def	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Def	The US troops fired into the hostile crowd , killing 4 .
va	Def	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Def	Read the entire article ; there ' s a punchline , too .
va	Def	My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat ' s passing for al - Qaeda has appeared at Newsday .
va	Def	The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
va	Def	If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership cannot find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues .
va	Def	Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
va	Def	"Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror ."""
va	Def	"The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , "" condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq ."""
va	Def	"Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was "" criminal "" and that "" the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad ""."
va	Def	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Def	"This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region ,"" the message claimed ."
va	Def	"Xinhua alleged that "" Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation ."""
va	Def	Ever since the first whispers about Google ' s IPO , most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that , even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution , the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit .
va	Def	Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
va	Def	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
va	Def	The other problem ?
va	Def	As the survey cited in the above - linked article shows , most Google users don ' t intend to use Gmail , and Google isn ' t even as popular as Yahoo ! and AOL .
va	Def	Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
va	Def	""" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in ,"" Masoud Shojai , head of the country ' s "" Iran Cartoon "" association and the fair organizer , said ."
va	Def	""" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison ,"" he added ."
va	Def	""" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ?"""
va	Def	Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran ' s Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
va	Def	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Def	This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
va	Def	When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
va	Def	The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
va	Def	Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
va	Def	The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah .
va	Def	Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
va	Def	Allawi ' s aged cousin and the man ' s wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
va	Def	The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance .
va	Def	If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
va	Def	The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
va	Def	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Def	The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
va	Def	Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .
va	Def	The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons .
va	Def	Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
va	Def	For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’ s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
va	Def	At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
va	Def	Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
va	Def	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’ s ever seen .
va	Def	With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
va	Def	Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
va	Def	The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
va	Def	It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
va	Def	North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
va	Def	The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
va	Def	Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq .
va	Def	I ran across this item on the Internet .
va	Def	"The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U . S . citizens ( most of whom were "" dual - citizens "")."
va	Def	Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U . S . citizen .
va	Def	"To pander to the mythical "" Arab street "", of course ."
va	Def	Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ).
va	Def	Yet we didn ' t charge them for the evacuation .
va	Def	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U . S . citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
va	Def	The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts .
va	Def	Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
va	Def	The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
va	Def	""" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home ,"" Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit ."
va	Def	"Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin ' s "" White House Briefing "" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ):"
va	Def	At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
va	Def	After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
va	Def	""" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that ."
va	Def	It ' s on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O ' Neill in Midland , Texas .
va	Def	He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
va	Def	The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor .
va	Def	One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn .
va	Def	The painting is based upon the hymn called , ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Def	The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .
va	Def	""" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep ."
va	Def	And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
va	Def	"That was the name of his "" autobiography "" -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 ."
va	Def	I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
va	Def	Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
va	Def	As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc . of Mountain View , California .
va	Def	My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1 . 1 , 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 releases .
va	Def	I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
va	Def	"Me and the big "" G """
va	Def	Following on the heels of Ben ' s annoucement yesterday , I thought I ' d post that I have joined Google as well .
va	Def	Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
va	Def	Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years ,...
va	Def	Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it ' s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
va	Def	In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
va	Def	If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
va	Def	They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
va	Def	I ' m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non - Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they ' re ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
va	Def	Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic .
va	Def	Thanks for the link .
va	Def	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr ' s movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
va	Def	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
va	Def	One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
va	Def	State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
va	Def	The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up .
va	Def	Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ).
va	Def	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
va	Def	The Washington Monthly ' s Who ' s Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
va	Def	"Sept . 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept . 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "" protect Israel ,"" according to the Asian Times ."
va	Def	Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
va	Def	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
va	Def	""" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same ,"" al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad ."
va	Def	He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
va	Def	And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
va	Def	The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
va	Def	I ' m not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
va	Def	Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for .

va	Def	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Def	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Def	In other words the table is set .
va	Def	Deal your meal from where the dishes are located .
va	Def	I . E . the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
va	Def	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .

va	Def	"I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper "" Making the most of mean reversion "" to estimate the mean reversion speed ."
va	Def	However , the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept .
va	Def	The coefficient and standard error are as followed :
va	Def	Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign .
va	Def	I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same .

va	Def	The complaint , filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St . Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St . Thomas , now known as River Garden .
va	Def	The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St . Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement .
va	Def	Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation , former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees .
va	Def	Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .

va	Def	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Def	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Def	NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
va	Def	On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
va	Def	""" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ], but I do not expect it ,"" Griffin added ."
va	Def	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
va	Def	Normally this author is semi - objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi . com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ).
va	Def	Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan . 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec . 25 , 2004 .
va	Def	It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
va	Def	He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
va	Def	Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel ' s partially completed West Bank barrier .
va	Def	Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
va	Def	Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
va	Def	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
va	Def	The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence .
va	Def	Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory .
va	Def	In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
va	Def	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Def	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Def	Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil .
va	Def	""" We ' re not happy with Hamas ' s position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians ,"" commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official ."
va	Def	""" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel ' s scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure ,"" Habib said ."
va	Def	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."

va	Ind	So he ' s got a -- I ' m a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
va	Ind	""" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer ."
va	Ind	This is not a filibuster .
va	Ind	That ' s a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
va	Ind	Now that ' s a rambling response .
va	Ind	"And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "" A Charge to Keep ""?"

va	Ind	Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .

va	Ind	Most likely not , if there is not a bird sitting on the eggs .

va	Ind	Make sure he isn ' t trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out .
va	Ind	i want a small indoor pet that my mother will let me have please help
va	Ind	Having a pet isn ' t easy .
va	Ind	They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up .
va	Ind	If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster .
va	Ind	I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse , rat , hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold .
va	Ind	Ive been dating a man from brittany france for a couple of months now .

te	Ind	What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e - mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
te	Ind	Google is a nice search engine .
te	Ind	Is that a money maker ?
te	Ind	John Donovan from Argghhh ! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah .
te	Ind	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Ind	( You don ' t need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you don ' t need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you ' re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ).
te	Ind	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
te	Ind	Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country ' s wealth and power .
te	Ind	BREYER filed a concurring opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG joined .
te	Ind	KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II .
te	Ind	SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO joined .
te	Ind	THOMAS filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA joined , and in which ALITO joined as to all but Parts I , II - C - 1 , and III - B - 2 .
te	Ind	ALITO filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III .
te	Ind	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
te	Ind	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Ind	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Ind	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).
te	Ind	He mentions his wife ' s death having an effect on him .
te	Ind	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Ind	This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .
te	Ind	I ' ve been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .
te	Ind	This is a terrorist organization plain and simple .
te	Ind	"In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "" raiding forces "" in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins ."
te	Ind	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Ind	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :
te	Ind	"U . S . Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "" war with Islamic fascists ,"" saying the term could inflame anti - Muslim tensions ."
te	Ind	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Ind	We ' ve got a Steven , the one word that didn ' t crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .
te	Ind	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Ind	But because we don ' t want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone ' s a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it ' s ever been .
te	Ind	This pledge is a new development .
te	Ind	This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush ' s aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .
te	Ind	It is a setback for the war on terror .
te	Ind	"Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "" Afghan Arabs "" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden ."
te	Ind	Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia ' s some 15 million citizens .
te	Ind	After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .
te	Ind	Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .
te	Ind	They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .
te	Ind	Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .
te	Ind	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .
te	Ind	"Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were "" no good targets "" in Afghanistan ."
te	Ind	Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .
te	Ind	But in fall of 1999 , Gen . Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .
te	Ind	Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .
te	Ind	i can think of a few things
te	Ind	that ' s fine , i don ' t want to see you either , i just need to make a cd .
te	Ind	i was thinking somewhere that requires a jacket , like tony ' s .
te	Ind	someplace that is like $ 30 an entree .
te	Ind	i had a blast that night .
te	Ind	Someone told me that Chase is planning a shitload of layoffs .
te	Ind	He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva .
te	Ind	This was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding performance .
te	Ind	I think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California ' s broken system --- a potential spoiler .
te	Ind	I ' m not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil .
te	Ind	i need to now get a job at house of pies b / c that is the only way to pay the bills .
te	Ind	can ' t go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket .

te	Ind	"While Tanya is reviewing credit , can you please send a "" blank form Paragraph 13 "" for this master ."
te	Ind	I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft Credit Support Annex ( similar in form to the one previously executed with ENA ).
te	Ind	I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a general feel of your end of the process .

te	Ind	In Wei ' s art , a logician could see mathematical logic , a cellist could see a ripple of nine bass notes , a country girl could see straw , and Harry Potter could see two accompanied green blazes .
te	Ind	"""... to gaze at Wei ' s art is like entering a floating world of dreams ."""

te	Def	( And , by the way , is anybody else just a little nostalgic for the days when that was a good thing ?)
te	Def	I ' m staying away from the stock .
te	Def	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Def	One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah .
te	Def	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Def	Compare the flags to the Fallujah one .
te	Def	This Fallujah operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the US Military since the end of the war .
te	Def	Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google ' s new toolbar , which , as noted in the linked article , commits just about every sin an online marketer could commit , and makes up a few new ones besides .
te	Def	I ' m not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument
te	Def	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Def	The United States doesn ' t believe the Iranian Government .
te	Def	One can suspect the Iranian Government .
te	Def	They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti - proliferation treaty .
te	Def	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn ' t even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
te	Def	One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage .
te	Def	Angry crowds chanted anti - American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop . 256 , 000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday .
te	Def	"Reuters reported that "" Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today ."""
te	Def	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Def	"Let aggressive ( American ) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city ' s security and safety , and ask them to lift their hands from the city ."""
te	Def	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders .
te	Def	Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there , since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals .
te	Def	They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .
te	Def	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v . Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D . C . Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
te	Def	The actual vote is a little confusing .
te	Def	Stay with me now : John Paul STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV , VI through VI - D - iii , VI - D - v , and VII , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined , and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI - D - iv , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined .
te	Def	I ' ll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I ' m finished .
te	Def	Important news such as President Bush ' s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti - gay ( update : he ' s not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
te	Def	I had to go to the BBC for this report .
te	Def	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Def	Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .
te	Def	At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .
te	Def	Two weeks later , and the violence continues .
te	Def	The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15 , 000 , according to analysts .
te	Def	And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .
te	Def	So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .
te	Def	Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
te	Def	I ' m not sure how the market will react .
te	Def	It doesn ' t change the company ' s intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
te	Def	On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
te	Def	em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .
te	Def	Because the 10 . 000 . 000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead .
te	Def	Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :
te	Def	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
te	Def	To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria ' s promised withdrawal .
te	Def	Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .
te	Def	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."
te	Def	"Over three years after 9 - 11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "" terrorist "" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts ."
te	Def	The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
te	Def	The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .
te	Def	This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80 ' s and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?
te	Def	This is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .
te	Def	The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .
te	Def	It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .
te	Def	The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .
te	Def	That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .
te	Def	Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans .
te	Def	"The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , "" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah ."
te	Def	"Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral ."""
te	Def	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .
te	Def	"The statement said , "" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal ."""
te	Def	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .
te	Def	Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti - Shiite pogroms .
te	Def	U . S . officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .
te	Def	"By using the word "" Islamic "" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier ."
te	Def	And if you haven ' t heard by now , the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :
te	Def	Nabeel Hussain , 21 , Waltham Forest Lest you be confused with the suspects from an earlier plot foiled in Canada a few months ago : Fahim Ahmad , 21 , Toronto ;
te	Def	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Def	Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days .
te	Def	One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .
te	Def	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Def	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Def	In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ).
te	Def	They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .
te	Def	( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ).
te	Def	Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .
te	Def	The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al - Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings .
te	Def	The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday .
te	Def	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Def	"The question is , "" Should he have known it was coming ?"""
te	Def	"The answer is , "" Yes !"""
te	Def	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Def	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
te	Def	Even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq .
te	Def	The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ).
te	Def	( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9 / 11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ??)
te	Def	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .
te	Def	Bush did not have his eye on the ball .
te	Def	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Def	Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
te	Def	"Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet ' s hair was "" on fire "" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists ."
te	Def	As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .
te	Def	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
te	Def	The plan was all set and could have succeeded .
te	Def	The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .

te	Def	We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction , now that the forex desk has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market .
te	Def	Further to my voicemail , our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve on the PSE swap .
te	Def	They are currently using 9 . 5 % fixed based on the 1 year implied volatility .
te	Def	Volatility of USD / DM has been in the range of between 7 % and 11 %.
te	Def	In addition , is there someone who could consider the correlation between US CPI and the $/ euro exchange rate .
te	Def	The credit guys are currently assuming that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the credit reserve on this basis too .
te	Def	I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston .

te	Def	The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995 .
te	Def	By September of that year the Dow had tumbled to 744 .
te	Def	The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of ' 67 .
te	Def	By March of ' 68 the Dow had fallen to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of ' 68 .
te	Def	The Dow then sank to 631 in December of ' 70 .
te	Def	By April of ' 71 the Dow had climbed back to 950 , only to fall to 869 in February of ' 72 .
te	Def	But by December of ' 73 the Dow had collapsed to 788 .
te	Def	Think that was bad - by December of ' 74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 .
te	Def	At that time , the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism .
te	Def	Of course , that was the bottom
te	Def	And that ' s the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down .

te	Def	"Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made in support of EPMI ' s obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement ("" PPA "") and Green Premium Sharing Agreement ("" GSPA "").?"
te	Def	The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our Cabazon Wind Power Project ( the project most recently financed by EWC ) and the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty .
te	Def	As we discussed last week , since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants , we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks .
te	Def	We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller ' s obligations under the PPA .
