tr	Masc	You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets .
tr	Masc	Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul .
tr	Masc	On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home .
tr	Masc	In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district .
tr	Masc	His mother was also killed in the attack .
tr	Masc	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Masc	The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas .
tr	Masc	Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran .
tr	Masc	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Masc	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Masc	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Masc	A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died .
tr	Masc	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al - Sahhaf .
tr	Masc	""" They are targetting ambulances "", "" American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women "", and "" They are using cluster bombs against civilians "" is all you get to hear from him ."
tr	Masc	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Masc	Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents .
tr	Masc	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Masc	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Masc	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Masc	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Masc	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Masc	If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts .
tr	Masc	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Masc	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Masc	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Masc	He could not name the others .
tr	Masc	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Masc	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Masc	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Masc	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Masc	"I still remember him stuttering about "" the General ,"" unable to remember Musharraf ' s name ."
tr	Masc	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Masc	"He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with "" stability ."""
tr	Masc	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Masc	He couldn ' t tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
tr	Masc	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Masc	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Masc	Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
tr	Masc	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Masc	He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
tr	Masc	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Masc	For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga ' s government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
tr	Masc	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Masc	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Masc	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Masc	Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell ' s bluff , challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands .
tr	Masc	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Masc	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Masc	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Masc	As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
tr	Masc	That he didn ’ t show up for duty in Alabama ?
tr	Masc	That he missed a physical ?
tr	Masc	That his daddy got him in ?
tr	Masc	Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
tr	Masc	As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
tr	Masc	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Masc	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Masc	He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
tr	Masc	And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
tr	Masc	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Masc	His superior officers said OK .
tr	Masc	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Masc	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Masc	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Masc	Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .
tr	Masc	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Masc	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Masc	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Masc	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Masc	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Masc	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty .”
tr	Masc	And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well .
tr	Masc	His column appears in The Hill each week .
tr	Masc	Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
tr	Masc	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Masc	"Chalabi describing Sha ' lan as a "" Ba ' athist "" and a "" former double agent for Saddam and the CIA "", while Sha ' lan dismisses Chalabi as a "" thief "" and an "" Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran ""."
tr	Masc	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Masc	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Masc	After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can ' t mention here .
tr	Masc	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Masc	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Masc	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Masc	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Masc	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Masc	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Masc	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Masc	And though he ' d been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
tr	Masc	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
tr	Masc	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Masc	But then , maybe that wouldn ' t have saved him either , because Posada is not Meiring .
tr	Masc	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Masc	An embarrassment to the US still , just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami , gloating in his freedom .
tr	Masc	"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Masc	So his name will remain unspoken .
tr	Masc	Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
tr	Masc	Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell ' s whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics .
tr	Masc	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross - examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .
tr	Masc	Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
tr	Masc	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Masc	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Masc	"Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records "" for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P . Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA ."""
tr	Masc	Judge Hughes wrote : ` government knowingly used false evidence against him ,' concluding ` honesty comes hard to government .'
tr	Masc	Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church .
tr	Masc	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .
tr	Masc	The newly released papers , showing him complicit in the airliner bombing , were mentioned
tr	Masc	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
tr	Masc	""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell ' s Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners ,"" he said ."
tr	Masc	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
tr	Masc	A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
tr	Masc	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Masc	He also writes for Aakrosh , India ' s defense - tied quarterly journal .
tr	Masc	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Masc	Until then he had said Pakistan ’ s options were open .
tr	Masc	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Masc	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Masc	Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
tr	Masc	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Masc	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .
tr	Masc	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Masc	He has never lived in a war zone .
tr	Masc	What was Bush doing with his youth ?
tr	Masc	He was drinking .
tr	Masc	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Masc	He gave no service to anyone , risked nothing , and did not even slack off efficiently .
tr	Masc	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Masc	"( Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet , "" Let heads roll !"")"
tr	Masc	He clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching executions .
tr	Masc	His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
tr	Masc	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Masc	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Masc	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Masc	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Masc	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Masc	Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
tr	Masc	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Masc	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Masc	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Masc	He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
tr	Masc	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Masc	On the phone , you could hear his accent .
tr	Masc	But he just melded with everybody .
tr	Masc	Blount ' s support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon ' s postmaster general .
tr	Masc	That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father ' s urging . . .
tr	Masc	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Masc	Ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5 : 30 or 6 : 00 in the evening .
tr	Masc	GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of ' 72 , Red Blount ' s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr . Bush ' s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
tr	Masc	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Masc	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Masc	After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr . Bush about it .
tr	Masc	The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
tr	Masc	In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
tr	Masc	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Masc	GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr . Bush enjoyed his freedom .
tr	Masc	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Masc	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Masc	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Masc	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Masc	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Masc	GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr . Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
tr	Masc	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Masc	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Masc	"And he would always laugh about that . """
tr	Masc	He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him .
tr	Masc	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Masc	""" He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself ."""
tr	Masc	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Masc	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Masc	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
tr	Masc	One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father ' s own brother .
tr	Masc	One man ' s relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post - war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year .
tr	Masc	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Masc	During this search , Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son ' s disappearance .
tr	Masc	"They ' re inseparable ,"" he says ."
tr	Masc	"Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : "" To hell with death ""."
tr	Masc	He blended belief systems such as Shamanism , Christianity , Buddhism , Paganism , Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil ' s vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners .
tr	Masc	I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W ' s head if he were to actually read the letter , but it is hard to picture him actually reading this letter .
tr	Masc	They have been accumulating for years , and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever he feels like it .
tr	Masc	Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
tr	Masc	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Masc	No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
tr	Masc	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
tr	Masc	There was certainly more despair in Saddam ' s Iraq than in Paul Bremmer ' s Iraq , and no one exploded himself .
tr	Masc	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Masc	Mr . Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
tr	Masc	"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "", the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader ""."
tr	Masc	He is now being outperformed by his successors .
tr	Masc	Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
tr	Masc	International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
tr	Masc	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Masc	He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
tr	Masc	The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities .
tr	Masc	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Masc	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Masc	Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $ 14 , 000 in July , accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks .
tr	Masc	"Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable , has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "" anthrax for Jew sympathizer only ."""
tr	Masc	He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader .
tr	Masc	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Masc	He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise .
tr	Masc	At one time , some thought he had been spotted in Iran .
tr	Masc	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Masc	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Masc	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Masc	Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda .
tr	Masc	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Masc	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Masc	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Masc	The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax .
tr	Masc	Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
tr	Masc	Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the fugitives .
tr	Masc	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Masc	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Masc	"His nickname is "" Jafar the Pilot ."""
tr	Masc	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Masc	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Masc	He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also has received pilot training .
tr	Masc	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Masc	According to at least some reports , Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad .
tr	Masc	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Masc	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Masc	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Masc	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Masc	Along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden .

tr	Masc	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Masc	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .
tr	Masc	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Masc	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him .

tr	Masc	I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn ' t want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis .
tr	Masc	I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say .
tr	Masc	He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality .
tr	Masc	He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then .
tr	Masc	Give him a call tommorow .
tr	Masc	Hopefully he didn ' t spel anyting incorrectly .
tr	Masc	I think he would be a good fit .
tr	Masc	Paul is out of the office today so I haven ' t had a chance to talk to him .
tr	Masc	I talked with Markat SW Gas - just honro his numbers
tr	Masc	They will be there by noon on the 20th , and the surgery will last 1 . 5 hours and then they ' ll watch him for 2 more hours before they put him into ICU .
tr	Masc	They are hoping he ' ll only be in the hospital 48 hours .
tr	Masc	Is this related to the problems he is having getting around ( circulatory ?)?
tr	Masc	He is joining an excellent company .
tr	Masc	I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA .
tr	Masc	Unfortunately , do to Mr . Lay ' s schedule he will not be able to participate .
tr	Masc	Meanwhile , Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to brainstorm on the ideas we ' ve generated and also to give us a sense of some of the issues as he sees them .
tr	Masc	Please let me know when he can expect to receive it .
tr	Masc	Unfortunately , Mr . Lay will be in San Jose , CA participating in a conference , where he is a speaker , on June 14 .
tr	Masc	I believe someone called about this today , but Mr . Lay asked me to let you know that these dates don ' t work for him , either .
tr	Masc	I spoke with Gerald and he said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad ' s place .

tr	Masc	I sure like his style of writing .
tr	Masc	His books are always hard to put down .
tr	Masc	His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L . L . C .

tr	Masc	I expect Craig didn ' t want Mom to see his place because it was messy .
tr	Masc	I think compared to my house , he ' s embarrased about his apartment .
tr	Masc	Then , also , he ' s got so much stuff in there right now , that I don ' t know how he ' s going to fit baby stuff .
tr	Masc	They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don ' t want 3 people in that small apartment .
tr	Masc	So he ' s going to have to start looking for another place .
tr	Masc	And his apartment is so run down down I ' m afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby .
tr	Masc	As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes , if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn ' t tell by his voice .
tr	Masc	Why didn ' t Craig show Ma his appartment ?
tr	Masc	What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben ( he was almost shocked )?
tr	Masc	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co - signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we ' re OK .
tr	Masc	As for Ted , things are still going well although I haven ' t see him at all this week ( we are two very busy people ).
tr	Masc	Anyway , I ' m sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
tr	Masc	Hopefully , if we ' re still dating come December , you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit .
tr	Masc	I ' m planning on dragging him to at least one of the U . T . games , I just have to find out when he wants to go ( as well as properly prepare him for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that is a U . T . game ).
tr	Masc	I think they ' ll send us another update once he ' s out of emergency and into a room .?
tr	Masc	Bobby is a member of a bicycle team , while cycling this weekend , he and other members of his team were injured by a truck .?
tr	Masc	He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub Hospital .?

tr	Masc	Keep Bobby , his team members and their families in your prayers .
tr	Masc	We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others .
tr	Masc	Unfortunately , I can ' t forward your message to him directly ( there seems to be a problem with the attachment ).
tr	Masc	Please send the draft to Troy Black and he will forward to the CP .
tr	Masc	Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp . likes their resolutions drafted than we are .
tr	Masc	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .

tr	Masc	I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives , and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London .
tr	Masc	He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business .

tr	Masc	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Masc	As I mentioned in my e - mail , John Lepore at Select Energy ( Settlements Group ) is trying to reconcile our list with his list .
tr	Masc	He needs more info about these trades ( i . e ., price info ) and would like to talk with you about it .
tr	Masc	His number is 860 - 665 - 2368 and e - mail address is leporjj @ selectenergy . com .
tr	Masc	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Masc	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Masc	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Masc	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Masc	He didn ' t mention anything about it .
tr	Masc	Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .
tr	Masc	Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .
tr	Masc	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Masc	""" Terry did this by himself ,'' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
tr	Masc	""" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing ."""
tr	Masc	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Masc	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Masc	""" We don ' t know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out ,"" Dunn said ."
tr	Masc	""" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact .''"
tr	Masc	We should resurrect Mike Smith ' s note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one .

tr	Masc	Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him .
tr	Masc	Dr . Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
tr	Masc	The bear dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 Mr . Parenteau , knocking him to the ground , he said .
tr	Masc	""" The bear gave chase and I gave chase ,"" he said ."
tr	Masc	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Masc	Dr . Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
tr	Masc	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr . Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr . Fortier said .
tr	Masc	Mr . Crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .

tr	Masc	Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from ' The Lotus Position ' or ' Padmasana '.
tr	Masc	Founder Paul Galvin came up with this name when his company started manufacturing radios for cars .
tr	Masc	Andreas Bechtolsheim built a microcomputer ; Vinod Khosla recruited him and Scott McNealy to manufacture computers based on it , and Bill Joy to develop a UNIX - based OS for the computer .
tr	Masc	The word was invented by Jonathan Swift and used in his book ' Gulliver ' s Travels '.
tr	Masc	My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
tr	Masc	This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U . S .- British subsidiary .
tr	Masc	My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
tr	Masc	""" They ' re just pushing them aside ,"" he said ."

tr	Masc	""" Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world ,"" he said ."
tr	Masc	""" Sudan is the primary example ,"" he said ."
tr	Masc	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
tr	Masc	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Masc	He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
tr	Masc	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Masc	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
tr	Masc	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Masc	His co - workers love him .
tr	Masc	His fellow judges love him .
tr	Masc	His family loves him .
tr	Masc	President Bush loves him .
tr	Masc	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Masc	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan . 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
tr	Masc	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Masc	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Masc	""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President ."""
tr	Masc	""" Commander In Chief "" doesn ' t mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
tr	Masc	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
tr	Masc	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Masc	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Masc	He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week ' s Chinese mission through formal channels .
tr	Masc	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .
tr	Masc	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Masc	But this is what he says about civet cats :
tr	Masc	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Masc	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Masc	""" I ' m pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations ,"" however , he cautioned ."
tr	Masc	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf ' s status .
tr	Masc	Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
tr	Masc	"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic ."""
tr	Masc	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .
tr	Masc	Meanwhile , President George W Bush has said he will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled .
tr	Masc	The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors .
tr	Masc	"At least he isn ' t using this disaster for cheap political point - scoring ."""
tr	Masc	Here , cars are absolutely necessary , and he ' d have to have one , too .
tr	Masc	What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he didn ' t order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
tr	Masc	About 30 seconds into his address , he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time .
tr	Masc	Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk .
tr	Masc	Even he can ' t believe that he is trotting out this old saw again .
tr	Masc	I ' m sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off .
tr	Masc	Like William Shakspere RAPHAEL ( the painter ) died on his April birthday Laura & Bridget ' s day :
tr	Masc	Upon the same day he conquered Darius , won a great victory at sea , & died the same day .
tr	Masc	Neither was this day less fortunate to his father Philip ; for on the same day he took Potidea ; >> - JOHN AUBREY , F . R . S .
tr	Masc	A Spanish refugee , ANTONIO PEREZ , visited England in 1593 and became acquainted with Francis & ANTHONY Bacon , with whom for a time he seems to have been on terms of intimacy , which did not last very long , for the Spaniard developed so much affectation & bombast that he became unpopular in Court circles .
tr	Masc	"In the play Holofernes is ridiculing Don Adriana "" the traveler from Spain "" and says of him : "" He is too picked , too spruce , too affected , Too odd , as it were , too PEREGRINate , as I may call it ."""

tr	Masc	1561 Ruy Lopez writes his book on chess .
tr	Masc	1576 Boi taken prisoner , but wins his freedom playing chess .
tr	Masc	The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly , in the light of one candle , at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations .
tr	Masc	Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading from the waters over the land , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . .
tr	Masc	He turned away .
tr	Masc	He could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare , which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss .
tr	Masc	<< He could do little during the day , for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas , or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
tr	Masc	At night , however , he slept alone , and the avenger might find him .
tr	Masc	On a certain evening , which had been prearranged , I sent my friend final instructions , for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room .
tr	Masc	He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note .
tr	Masc	He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress .
tr	Masc	They had gagged me , and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address .
tr	Masc	I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia .
tr	Masc	How they murdered him I do not know , save that it was Murillo ' s hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .
tr	Masc	I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed .
tr	Masc	At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar ; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks .
tr	Masc	"John Lennon ' s divorce followed , as well as his entering the world of black magic , as deeply as to buy the apartment . where the "" Rosemary ' s baby "" had been filmed , previous property of Roman Polansky , and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations ."
tr	Masc	"At the same time , the devil acted through his other main puppets with "" Sympathy for the devil "" that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ), murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin ."
tr	Masc	"Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "" Peace "", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of "" The ballad of John and Yoko "": "" the way things are going , they ' re going to crucify me ..."", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine ( today condensed in the "" Lennon remembers "" book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming "" whatever is up there "" for it ( referring to God )."
tr	Masc	The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead .
tr	Masc	"After George Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : "" I want to talk about the divinity of man "", he was given throat cancer by GOD because of those words , which made metastasis and carried on to final death .."
tr	Masc	"To Paul McCartney whose company ' s logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "" Sir "" ( when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir , as long as he produces money for the nation ), GOD provided cancer to the wife ."
tr	Masc	"The advertising farce of how much he loved Linda ( woman whose quality he did not deserve ), was exposed when it was known that Paul had an affair with Heather Mills , Linda ' s intimate friend , with whom McCartney went on a trip to New York and to whom he bought things and presents , while he was still mourning for his "" dear Linda ""."
tr	Masc	At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda ' s death for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity .
tr	Masc	Paul was going out with Heather , but in front of the audience he played the faithful husband ' s masquerade pretending to suffer for Linda , for the afore mentioned promotional ends .
tr	Masc	Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he didn ' t say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much .
tr	Masc	"The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality , he grew the beard that we see in the "" Let it Be "" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film , doing every effort he could to be seen as a man ...."
tr	Masc	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Masc	Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg , so that he could stand out , being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again , as Jane and Linda did .
tr	Masc	This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
tr	Masc	He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness .
tr	Masc	Besides being a murderer , John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern , trauma from which he never recovered .
tr	Masc	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."
tr	Masc	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Masc	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .
tr	Masc	The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George ' s house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from .
tr	Masc	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Masc	George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon ....
tr	Masc	Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic , and he does lots of charity , thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife ' s life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic .
tr	Masc	He thinks he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived .
tr	Masc	"After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "" Devil ' s Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc ., etc .,"
tr	Masc	This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil ' s Island .

tr	Masc	Ugh my dad is so stupid ... he just doesn ' t understand anything !
tr	Masc	I have 5 sisters and so including my mom ... he is the only guy in a house of six females .
tr	Masc	Now I ' m the youngest and I just got my period so now we all have ours and he thinks it ' s a good thing ?
tr	Masc	"He ' s always like "" ohh you must be so happy to finally have yours , I wish I had mine !"" and he isn ' t even joking ."
tr	Masc	I think just living in a house with so many girls is making him go crazy ?
tr	Masc	Yep , the females are just getting to him ... dads ..
tr	Masc	Don ' t blame him please , he feels lonely and wants to show his attention to all of you to look after you , please forgive and sympathy if he miss something .
tr	Masc	I am sorry for him , he is a good dad
tr	Masc	He loved it .
tr	Masc	But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ).
tr	Masc	He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
tr	Masc	I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn ' t use it -
tr	Masc	he makes so much MORE noise , as he plays and digs and jumps ( seriously )
tr	Masc	in his cage in the bathroom ?
tr	Masc	If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
tr	Masc	Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .
tr	Masc	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Masc	You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .
tr	Masc	I would personally put him somewhere else .
tr	Masc	I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body .
tr	Masc	When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
tr	Masc	He might be sick take him to the vet to see
tr	Masc	If he always does this , welcome to the club .
tr	Masc	What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
tr	Masc	Hey there , I ' m trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday .
tr	Masc	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Masc	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Masc	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Masc	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Masc	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Masc	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Masc	When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can ' t produce milk .
tr	Masc	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Masc	him to get to know his new home .
tr	Masc	As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now .
tr	Masc	So now i wanted to bouild up relationship with him so i got a piece of carrot and i put it on my hand , i moved very slowly and he suddenly run away to his tube .
tr	Masc	Why , how can i build up realtion ship with him he is also not useing the thing that he runs on and he wakes up walks around and goes to sleep again ???
tr	Masc	Please help im worried about him !!!
tr	Masc	Firstly , your hammie was not stressed out , he wanted attention .
tr	Masc	Thirdly , just put your hand in his cge ans leave it their .
tr	Masc	He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit .
tr	Masc	Give him time .
tr	Masc	You only got him yesterday .
tr	Masc	He ' s probably still scared and unsure .
tr	Masc	Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
tr	Masc	Once he is more comfy with his surroundings , then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more .
tr	Masc	But just give him time for now .
tr	Masc	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Masc	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Masc	I thought that I had gained my cockatiel ' s trust , but now he ' s not coming to me when I open his cage .
tr	Masc	Did anything happen before losing his trust ?
tr	Masc	A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you .
tr	Masc	"Eating by his cage and keeping a "" sleep cage "" in your room is a good idea ."
tr	Masc	Keep his cage open and go on your computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
tr	Masc	Let him go at his own pace , don ' t rush with him , and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird .
tr	Masc	he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
tr	Masc	But then again he could be !
tr	Masc	How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
tr	Masc	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Masc	Almost every day he ' d even wake me up like 5am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
tr	Masc	I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
tr	Masc	Do you think he ' s teething ?
tr	Masc	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Masc	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Masc	He ' d just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
tr	Masc	When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
tr	Masc	he may be teething but i dont think it can be stopped .
tr	Masc	maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
tr	Masc	lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , hes also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
tr	Masc	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
tr	Masc	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
tr	Masc	He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
tr	Masc	"He ' s the issue , you are trying to "" Make "" them mate ."

tr	Masc	( I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again ) so I fineally checked it , and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida !!!
tr	Masc	lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
tr	Masc	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Masc	The place where I ' m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
tr	Masc	I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
tr	Masc	He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
tr	Masc	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Masc	My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
tr	Masc	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Masc	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Masc	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Masc	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
tr	Masc	Recently I ' m having trouble training him .
tr	Masc	He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
tr	Masc	And he is not following me when I was walking .
tr	Masc	Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
tr	Masc	And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , doesn ' t listen to me .
tr	Masc	He is really excited about anybody he see .
tr	Masc	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Masc	This way , he cannot reach the leash to chew it .
tr	Masc	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Masc	Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
tr	Masc	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Masc	You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
tr	Masc	Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
tr	Masc	why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
tr	Masc	try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
tr	Masc	or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
tr	Masc	So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
tr	Masc	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Masc	Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
tr	Masc	you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
tr	Masc	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Masc	you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
tr	Masc	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Masc	you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
tr	Masc	close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
tr	Masc	he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
tr	Masc	he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
tr	Masc	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Masc	in a week ' s time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
tr	Masc	let him out for half an hour , to explore .
tr	Masc	then put him back in .
tr	Masc	he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .
tr	Masc	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Masc	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Masc	remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
tr	Masc	remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
tr	Masc	he might even start peeing on things in fear .
tr	Masc	good luck with your new house and with his new territory !
tr	Masc	( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
tr	Masc	I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
tr	Masc	My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
tr	Masc	I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wont work .
tr	Masc	He wont even get close to the crate .
tr	Masc	If I come towards him , he will run away .
tr	Masc	How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
tr	Masc	He wont do anything on command .
tr	Masc	Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason .
tr	Masc	Let him walk in and out for a few days .
tr	Masc	At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
tr	Masc	Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
tr	Masc	With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
tr	Masc	He will learn to really like this .
tr	Masc	Have patience with him , you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home .
tr	Masc	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Masc	He ' ll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
tr	Masc	He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight .
tr	Masc	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Masc	I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it .. what should i do ?
tr	Masc	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Masc	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Masc	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Masc	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .
tr	Masc	He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
tr	Masc	3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
tr	Masc	He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ).
tr	Masc	They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
tr	Masc	i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
tr	Masc	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Masc	according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
tr	Masc	he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
tr	Masc	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Masc	i handle him every few days .
tr	Masc	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Masc	i just love him to death .
tr	Masc	i don ' t know why he won ' t eat though !
tr	Masc	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
tr	Masc	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
tr	Masc	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Masc	he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
tr	Masc	he doesn ' t seem to know that they are food .
tr	Masc	"i have tried "" braining "" both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he doesn ' t care ."
tr	Masc	he wont even try to bite .
tr	Masc	he hasn ' t eaten in an entire month .
tr	Masc	i ' ve only tried to feed him one at a time .
tr	Masc	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Masc	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
tr	Masc	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
tr	Masc	If he doesn ' t seem interested in them at all I would say he ' s just not hungry .
tr	Masc	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Masc	right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
tr	Masc	as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
tr	Masc	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Masc	you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
tr	Masc	that will help to reassure him , and he will be less aggressive with her .
tr	Masc	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
tr	Masc	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Masc	He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
tr	Masc	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Masc	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Masc	The people rejected their attempt to topple the government , and for all intents and purposes the US military ( and the ARVN ) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time - frame he ordered it .
tr	Masc	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Masc	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Masc	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Masc	They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it .
tr	Masc	In the end Nixon kept his promise for “… peace with honor ….”
tr	Masc	He ' s getting used to his new home , but hasn ' t eatin yet .
tr	Masc	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Masc	1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
tr	Masc	He is my farrier ( shoes my horses feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
tr	Masc	Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty .
tr	Masc	He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
tr	Masc	We were also just talking about my horse ' s crappy feet and he mentioned .
tr	Masc	""" Well , if you ever just want to see me I ' ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after ."""
tr	Masc	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Masc	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Masc	He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
tr	Masc	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Masc	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Masc	I don ' t know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
tr	Masc	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Masc	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Masc	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Masc	Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
tr	Masc	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Masc	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Masc	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Masc	He is a few years older than me .
tr	Masc	And yes , I do like him .
tr	Masc	To answer Barry White , yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he ' s waiting for .
tr	Masc	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Masc	He will call you back Im sure !
tr	Masc	Sounds like He really likes you ..
tr	Masc	would You like going for * coffee * with him ?
tr	Masc	or is he Not your type ?
tr	Masc	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
tr	Masc	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
tr	Masc	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
tr	Masc	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
tr	Masc	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Masc	He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
tr	Masc	Well one day he said to me You know i don ' t wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
tr	Masc	Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn ' t see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
tr	Masc	Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
tr	Masc	I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
tr	Masc	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Masc	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Masc	From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he ' s doing a really shitty job .
tr	Masc	Leaving nails out so you ' ll call and have him come back out later ?
tr	Masc	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Masc	This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
tr	Masc	He ' s not lame , but he ' s been having issues .
tr	Masc	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Masc	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
tr	Masc	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ).
tr	Masc	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
tr	Masc	Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .
tr	Masc	He can eat all his feed and doesn ' t drop any , but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
tr	Masc	He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .
tr	Masc	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Masc	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
tr	Masc	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
tr	Masc	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
tr	Masc	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
tr	Masc	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
tr	Masc	I ' ll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....
tr	Masc	Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .
tr	Masc	I will be calling my vet and chiro about him .
tr	Masc	Worse comes to worse , I ' m out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
tr	Masc	He ' s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
tr	Masc	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Masc	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Masc	I will also be having my other vet up who ' s a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
tr	Masc	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Masc	He ' s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn ' t be related ).
tr	Masc	He ' s not starving .
tr	Masc	He ' s dropping we
tr	Masc	He ' s not starving .
tr	Masc	He ' s dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days .
tr	Masc	He ' s not putting it back on .
tr	Masc	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
tr	Masc	If that is the case then acupuncture isn ' t going to hurt him .
tr	Masc	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
tr	Masc	One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM .
tr	Masc	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Masc	Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy ?
tr	Masc	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Masc	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
tr	Masc	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Masc	He knows what hes doing .
tr	Masc	the guy came on time and didn ' t take any breaks , he went straight to work and finished the job efficiently and promptly !
tr	Masc	I would rate Fran pcs an A + because the price was lower than everyone else , i got my computer back the next day , and the professionalism he showed was great .
tr	Masc	He took the time to explain things to me about my computer , i would recommend you go to him .
tr	Masc	"As a qualified criminal defense attorney , he will work every possible legal "" angle "" ( leaving no stone unturned ) of your case to achieve the most favorable result possible ."
tr	Masc	He was less than half of the price of the cheapest quote we got , and his work was top notch .
tr	Masc	They are preparing my older son for kindergarten and looks forward to seeing his teacher and friends everyday .
tr	Masc	I would recommend him to anyone .
tr	Masc	We trust and appreciate Scott Larson and know that he will always take good care of us and listen to our needs !

tr	Masc	Dr . Wallen explained the procedure in detail and took his time with me .
tr	Masc	For example , I actually forgot to feed my cat , and they went out of their way to take care of him .
tr	Masc	Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion ( Not Digital ) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
tr	Masc	I didn ' t end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
tr	Masc	Dr . Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday .
tr	Masc	We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos .
tr	Masc	He knows his bees !
tr	Masc	This French born , French trained chef and his creative partners offer a taste fresh , locally sourced , fabulously prepared food in the most unlikely of locations .
tr	Masc	Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable !
tr	Masc	My husband has been a professional chef , so he is a good judge of quality food .
tr	Masc	went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake !
tr	Masc	I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
tr	Masc	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
tr	Masc	He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
tr	Masc	I will reccommend his services however / whenever possible !
tr	Masc	Nigel from Nidd Design has always provided a first class service , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications .
tr	Masc	His knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application , ensuring compliance with the building regulations .
tr	Masc	He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home !
tr	Masc	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
tr	Masc	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Masc	If your coach has no fights and you never see him train and sweat something is wrong !
tr	Masc	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
tr	Masc	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
tr	Masc	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Masc	I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
tr	Masc	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
tr	Masc	Dave is a patient and methodical teacher , who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take .
tr	Masc	Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
tr	Masc	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Masc	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Masc	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Masc	I would recommend him to everyone !
tr	Masc	He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
tr	Masc	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Masc	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Masc	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
tr	Masc	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Masc	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
tr	Masc	He was patient and adapted when everything didn ' t go according to schedule on my wedding day .
tr	Masc	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Masc	He got the pictures back to me quickly .
tr	Masc	He will exceed your expectations !
tr	Masc	He doesn ' t just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won ' t even notice that there ' s a camera there .
tr	Masc	My husband just got a bike there as a gift he ' s only had it a month .
tr	Masc	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
tr	Masc	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Masc	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Masc	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
tr	Masc	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Masc	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
tr	Masc	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Masc	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Masc	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
tr	Masc	"grey shirt "" mark "" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing ....."
tr	Masc	OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
tr	Masc	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Masc	I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
tr	Masc	"He told me "" no problem , we will match the offer or do better ."""
tr	Masc	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Masc	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
tr	Masc	I think he could ' ve done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
tr	Masc	Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
tr	Masc	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Masc	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Masc	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Masc	He had a robe that was made back in the ' 60s .
tr	Masc	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Masc	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
tr	Masc	In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
tr	Masc	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Masc	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
tr	Masc	If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
tr	Masc	He did warm it up .
tr	Masc	He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
tr	Masc	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Masc	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ).
tr	Masc	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Masc	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
tr	Masc	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Masc	I could not understand any his reasons .
tr	Masc	At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
tr	Masc	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
tr	Masc	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Masc	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Masc	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Masc	To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
tr	Masc	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Masc	"We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , "" was I gotta have it !"""
tr	Masc	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Masc	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Masc	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Masc	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Masc	He was referred to me by a friend , who didn ' t have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
tr	Masc	He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
tr	Masc	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
tr	Masc	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Masc	Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
tr	Masc	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Masc	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
tr	Masc	"When I inquired he rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out you ' ll get it back ."""
tr	Masc	"He responded "" we have problem with ' people '""."
tr	Masc	I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
tr	Masc	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Masc	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Masc	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Masc	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Masc	"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" you do not order what you do not know about "" and "" you don ' t know how pizza is made ""."
tr	Masc	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
tr	Masc	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn ' t so well - done ( actually , burnt ).
tr	Masc	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my * ss .
tr	Masc	This chef knows what he is doing .
tr	Masc	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Masc	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Masc	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
tr	Masc	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car .
tr	Masc	He is my mechanic going forward !
tr	Masc	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Masc	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Masc	After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
tr	Masc	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Masc	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which isn ' t true .
tr	Masc	I mean , I don ' t care if he doesn ' t know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there ' s no way I ' m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
tr	Masc	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Masc	He stood there and told us how he wasn ' t at fault .
tr	Masc	And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
tr	Masc	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Masc	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Masc	"After he already put product on my hair he said "" I should warn you , I ' m expensive ."""
tr	Masc	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Masc	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Masc	"He then "" fixed "" it for free but it still looked like crap ."
tr	Masc	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
tr	Masc	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Masc	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
tr	Masc	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Masc	He said yes .
tr	Masc	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Masc	I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
tr	Masc	He never once contacted us .
tr	Masc	He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and didn ' t seem terribly apologetic .
tr	Masc	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Masc	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Masc	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
tr	Masc	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Masc	"He later said that by 2 months he "" meant at least two months ""."
tr	Masc	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
tr	Masc	He also never even said he was sorry .
tr	Masc	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Masc	I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
tr	Masc	He said it sarcastically .
tr	Masc	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
tr	Masc	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Masc	And he says : You ' re at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
tr	Masc	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Masc	He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I ' m in PHILLY .
tr	Masc	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Masc	he says : Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
tr	Masc	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Masc	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
tr	Masc	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Masc	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Masc	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Masc	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Masc	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Neut	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Neut	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Neut	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Neut	But in my view it is highly significant .
tr	Neut	And there is nothing we can do about it really , people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land .
tr	Neut	Most people haven ' t gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal is ).
tr	Neut	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Neut	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Neut	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Neut	It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
tr	Neut	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Neut	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Neut	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Neut	Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .
tr	Neut	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Neut	Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .
tr	Neut	It should continue to be defanged .
tr	Neut	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Neut	Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there .
tr	Neut	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .
tr	Neut	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Neut	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Neut	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Neut	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Neut	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Neut	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Neut	So , one answer to Bush ' s charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
tr	Neut	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Neut	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Neut	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel ' s security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Neut	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Neut	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Neut	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Neut	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Neut	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
tr	Neut	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Neut	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country ' s petroleum reserves .
tr	Neut	Israel ' s security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
tr	Neut	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Neut	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Neut	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Neut	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Neut	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Neut	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Neut	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Neut	The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession .
tr	Neut	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""
tr	Neut	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Neut	India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China ( which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
tr	Neut	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
tr	Neut	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Neut	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Neut	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Neut	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Neut	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Neut	They don ' t let just anybody do it .
tr	Neut	It was full - time work .
tr	Neut	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Neut	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Neut	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Neut	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it ’ s important or not in November .
tr	Neut	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Neut	And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush ’ s service , while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry ’ s .
tr	Neut	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Neut	It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha ' lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
tr	Neut	Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
tr	Neut	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Neut	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Neut	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Neut	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .

tr	Neut	And It ' s Not Hard To Do .... IF You Know HOW .
tr	Neut	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Neut	It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar .
tr	Neut	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Neut	It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea .
tr	Neut	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Neut	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Neut	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Neut	Considering the islands ' huge strategic importance , it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been .
tr	Neut	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Neut	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Neut	In fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti - India outfits , such as the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these networks and weaken India ' s eastern flank .
tr	Neut	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Neut	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Neut	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Neut	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Neut	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate . ]
tr	Neut	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Neut	The neighbours are still interfering , but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’ s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it .
tr	Neut	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Neut	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Neut	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Neut	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Neut	Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
tr	Neut	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Neut	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate .
tr	Neut	So far what they have done together has been good for us and that ’ s how we would like to keep it ’’, says Karzai .
tr	Neut	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Neut	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Neut	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Neut	( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn ' t absent yourself from it .
tr	Neut	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Neut	But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
tr	Neut	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Neut	It was a Texas accent .
tr	Neut	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Neut	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Neut	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Neut	I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
tr	Neut	It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .
tr	Neut	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Neut	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Neut	"Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : "" It ' s unbelievable that no one can account for 200 , 000 assault rifles ."
tr	Neut	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Neut	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Neut	It ' s always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration ' s harshest mainstream critics .
tr	Neut	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Neut	And it ' s guilty :
tr	Neut	""" It was about how he could humiliate her the most ,"" prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments ."
tr	Neut	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
tr	Neut	just go here , its simply amazing
tr	Neut	Of course law enforcement has dragged it ' s feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
tr	Neut	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .

tr	Neut	""" Another generation of heavy metal has taken over , and -- sorry -- it ain ' t just about strippers and dope ."
tr	Neut	Okay , it ' s partly about strippers and dope .

tr	Neut	It ' s become a guardian of morality -- not church morality ; real morality .
tr	Neut	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Neut	The wikipedia entry for Aerocom is just a stub .. waiting for someone to put some information into it ....
tr	Neut	That ' s it .
tr	Neut	Well , it ' s not as simple and clear cut as all that .
tr	Neut	Here is a thought : When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Neut	It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
tr	Neut	They are doing it deliberately .
tr	Neut	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Neut	When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
tr	Neut	Why don ' t you state it ?
tr	Neut	( Don ' t wish to use Wikipedia again , it ' s just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information .)
tr	Neut	Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers .
tr	Neut	It would have been too painful to watch .
tr	Neut	But succintly making point after succint point , the text of the letter stands on its own merit , regardless .
tr	Neut	"As I read the letter , I considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it , vs . that of the mind of the man who once said "" Bring it on !"""
tr	Neut	Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
tr	Neut	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush ' s claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
tr	Neut	I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
tr	Neut	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
tr	Neut	I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non - violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it ' s important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
tr	Neut	It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi - nation corporation .
tr	Neut	It ' s a long but very worthwhile read .
tr	Neut	However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
tr	Neut	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
tr	Neut	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
tr	Neut	Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
tr	Neut	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Neut	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Neut	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Neut	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Neut	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Neut	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Neut	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Neut	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Neut	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Neut	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Neut	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Neut	Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
tr	Neut	It creates headlines .
tr	Neut	It is spectacular .
tr	Neut	It is frightening .
tr	Neut	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Neut	It is always shown on television in great detail .
tr	Neut	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Neut	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
tr	Neut	And it is a war !
tr	Neut	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
tr	Neut	No relative of anyone influential has done it .
tr	Neut	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Neut	It never happens there .
tr	Neut	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Neut	If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
tr	Neut	Russia is beginning to understand it .
tr	Neut	Turkey understands it well .
tr	Neut	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
tr	Neut	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Neut	It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
tr	Neut	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Neut	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Neut	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Neut	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Neut	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
tr	Neut	It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
tr	Neut	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Neut	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Neut	The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
tr	Neut	But it cannot be avoided .
tr	Neut	Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
tr	Neut	I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
tr	Neut	It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
tr	Neut	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Neut	The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
tr	Neut	What can we do about it ?
tr	Neut	In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
tr	Neut	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Neut	"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" supplies "" from expanding the tumor ."
tr	Neut	If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
tr	Neut	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Neut	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Neut	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Neut	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Neut	It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
tr	Neut	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Neut	It is ruthless .
tr	Neut	It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
tr	Neut	It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
tr	Neut	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Neut	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Neut	Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
tr	Neut	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Neut	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Neut	When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
tr	Neut	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Neut	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Neut	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Neut	But it really does not matter .
tr	Neut	In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
tr	Neut	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Neut	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Neut	It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
tr	Neut	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Neut	"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."""
tr	Neut	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Neut	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Neut	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Neut	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Neut	It ' s just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI ' s ( former ) theory about a lone , American scientist .
tr	Neut	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Neut	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Neut	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"

tr	Neut	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Neut	The confidante and right - hand man of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets .
tr	Neut	The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts .
tr	Neut	Significantly , the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ), upon being contacted , does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft . Detrick .
tr	Neut	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Neut	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Neut	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Neut	As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino .
tr	Neut	It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui , who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology .
tr	Neut	While it ' s not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought .
tr	Neut	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Neut	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Neut	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Neut	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Neut	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Neut	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Neut	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""

tr	Neut	I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
tr	Neut	Business Case : If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $ 10 , 000 increase ( approximately 25 %) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
tr	Neut	It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted .
tr	Neut	Let me know your thoughts .... then I will run it by Oxley .
tr	Neut	It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion .
tr	Neut	It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing , including market - based pricing alternatives to FERC ' s traditional pricing methods .
tr	Neut	The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system .
tr	Neut	There is a corporate data sheet for this company , but this entity seems to have been inactive since it ' s creation .
tr	Neut	So I suggest it be assigned to Leon .
tr	Neut	It should be 4 - easy .
tr	Neut	It should be assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ).
tr	Neut	I see that it is a 4 , so that will be no problem .
tr	Neut	By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent .
tr	Neut	They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
tr	Neut	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
tr	Neut	"It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling )."
tr	Neut	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20 , 000 .
tr	Neut	Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .
tr	Neut	I haven ' t even changed the wording after I first put it down .
tr	Neut	Neil has a meeting in San Antonio ( usually it is in Miami , San Francisco , Phoenix - not so great this year ).
tr	Neut	It is the officer ' s meeting for Enterprise , and spouses are invited .
tr	Neut	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
tr	Neut	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
tr	Neut	All the guys at work are saying I shouldn ' t bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one .
tr	Neut	Don ' t take that deal out until I look at it .
tr	Neut	I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book ( I only wrote it in my red book ).
tr	Neut	I haven ' t had a chance to send it yet .
tr	Neut	I ' ll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not .
tr	Neut	Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle ' s help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
tr	Neut	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
tr	Neut	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Neut	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations .
tr	Neut	I have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so I hope that it makes sense .
tr	Neut	Don ' t worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker .
tr	Neut	Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is .
tr	Neut	You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
tr	Neut	WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
tr	Neut	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Neut	They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .
tr	Neut	Are whole offices ( eg Tokyo ) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices ?
tr	Neut	it ' s on tonight
tr	Neut	it ' s did you watch your girl on tv last night ?
tr	Neut	They are invoicing for this and I don ' t have an invoice for it .
tr	Neut	They are invoicing for this and I don ' t have an invoice for it .

tr	Neut	I ' m still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement .
tr	Neut	Also , it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly .
tr	Neut	You review and approve it , keep it on your desk , and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday .
tr	Neut	Then I ' ll take it to Ed for his approval .
tr	Neut	I will deliver it to you for your approval .
tr	Neut	love TO HAVE YOU ALONG FOR THE COMPANY , BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY .
tr	Neut	I ' ll still be here in Boston so we ' d do it over the phone .
tr	Neut	Will you be in Houston on that day or we shall do it over the phone ?
tr	Neut	July 12 , 2 : 30 it is .
tr	Neut	How can we arrange it ?
tr	Neut	I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality .
tr	Neut	I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures .
tr	Neut	It ' s a very ambitious site -- with state - of - the - art WSI weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL .
tr	Neut	After one month ' s full - bore effort , I ' m pleased with the results ( e . g ., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ).
tr	Neut	It will be nice to see you again .
tr	Neut	Can you find out who I need to send it to in HR ?
tr	Neut	They showed some kids on TV , and they were quite taken with it .
tr	Neut	If you are not the intended recipient or an authorized representative of the intended recipient , you are hereby notified that any review , dissemination or copying of this email and its attachments , if any , or the information contained herein is prohibited .
tr	Neut	Yes , but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood to the brain .
tr	Neut	I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information regarding some of the titles for various employees .
tr	Neut	I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet .
tr	Neut	It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file is accurate , including titles , as this information is being given directly to John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen .
tr	Neut	I finally got it to blackline correctly .
tr	Neut	Here it is .
tr	Neut	It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly .
tr	Neut	As I watched my mother and father ' s health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die , it is a very defining time in our lives .
tr	Neut	As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable , it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can .
tr	Neut	It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney .
tr	Neut	It was a 7 lb ., 10 oz ., 20 inch little boy .
tr	Neut	Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work .
tr	Neut	In the next week or so , we ' ll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues , and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it .
tr	Neut	Ken said to go ahead and equip it with what you think it should have .
tr	Neut	Now it is time to take the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education system .

tr	Neut	I can ' t remember if you guys could do it or not .
tr	Neut	Actually it is not a new truck .
tr	Neut	Oh , it is dueled out through one catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound .
tr	Neut	Now , Debbie wants it .
tr	Neut	It is very clean and is Sandalwood , Driftwood or something of that nature in color .
tr	Neut	Debbie said , it is going to be hard on me to sale my old dodge truck .
tr	Neut	It was sure beautiful coming up last night .
tr	Neut	I am half way through the first and you can borrow it when I am through .
tr	Neut	1 . I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to change it over to you name .
tr	Neut	I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year .
tr	Neut	Otherwise , I will be sending it to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning .
tr	Neut	It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn ' t know anything about it and get them to initial it .
tr	Neut	I can print it here , initial it , and fax it to whomever you want .
tr	Neut	Where and to whom do you want it faxed ?
tr	Neut	Since it will be Janet signing , it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first .
tr	Neut	Otherwise , I will be sending it to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning .
tr	Neut	I ' m working on it now .
tr	Neut	Maybe we ( Enron ) could review it tomorrow morning , then send it to FCE .
tr	Neut	That way , we can get it to them in time for weekend review .
tr	Neut	It was good to hear from you !
tr	Neut	It ' s funny , because usually it ' s just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia doesn ' t really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me !), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
tr	Neut	It was good having the girls down .
tr	Neut	It ' s not for the meek .
tr	Neut	It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
tr	Neut	It ' s got its own bathroom and tv , and is pretty cozy .
tr	Neut	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Neut	But , I guess , it ' s a start ...
tr	Neut	It ' s good chatting with you .
tr	Neut	Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving , I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I ' ve ever had ( I not gonna tell them that , I don ' t want them getting swell heads ).
tr	Neut	Your gonna be the first to see the new baby ( woudn ' t it be wierd if the baby gets botn on Jan 5th ?)
tr	Neut	If so , I ' ll get it signed by Craig Breslau today , then bring it to you for countersignature .
tr	Neut	No , it does not mean that .
tr	Neut	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Neut	I ' d forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
tr	Neut	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Neut	I ' m going to assume that you didn ' t get around to it .
tr	Neut	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Neut	I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully .
tr	Neut	Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have established , I have the memory of an elephant ).
tr	Neut	Thought you ' d like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec . 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it ' s all about you and your needs .
tr	Neut	I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ).
tr	Neut	There is no pleasure in having nothing to do ; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it .
tr	Neut	fyi ... it sound like Bobby is in serious condition .
tr	Neut	Then it ' s real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number .? The address is below .?
tr	Neut	It doesn ' t sound like he can receive visitors yet .
tr	Neut	I think it ' s a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ).
tr	Neut	Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires ?
tr	Neut	Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with more than one of you in one place .
tr	Neut	If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
tr	Neut	"If you still have it , can you send it to him at "" Mark EI . London Taylor ""?"
tr	Neut	I will take care of it .
tr	Neut	Ineos is an English company which has a majority of its operations in the US .
tr	Neut	If they ' re OK with it , we ' d like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections .
tr	Neut	Hope you ' ve been storing up sleep , cause it looks like you won ' t be getting much for a while .
tr	Neut	I don ' t want to wait till month end , let ' s adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order , lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts .
tr	Neut	However , if you can wait til 2 : 00pm to eat , go ahead and grab something and expense it !
tr	Neut	I ' ll believe it when I see it .
tr	Neut	I ' m glad they want to follow - up with Steve ( I ' ve been pushing it ) and I ' ve got some follow - up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post - call .
tr	Neut	Attached for your review are copies of the settlement documents that were filed today in the Gas Industry Restructuring / Natural Gas Strategy proceeding , including the Motion for Approval of the Comprehensive Settlement that is supported by thirty signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement , the Comprehensive Settlement document itself , and the various appendices to the settlement .?
tr	Neut	You have all devoted considerable time , resources and spirit in the preparation of this document - and it shows .?
tr	Neut	You still considering it ?
tr	Neut	Let us know and we can add it , and make any other changes you ' d like to make at this end .
tr	Neut	Sandi sez it ' s actually happening at 10 AM and it ' s renewable - focused .
tr	Neut	Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
tr	Neut	If we are covered , then was it necessary to register EnronOnline ?

tr	Neut	It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend .
tr	Neut	I am going to count it as signed , since BC Gas has signed , but we still need it to be signed by ECC .
tr	Neut	Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me .
tr	Neut	Updating another blue file because Susan B ., this time , has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes !
tr	Neut	It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on , and you probably didn ' t see them at first .
tr	Neut	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Neut	I understand that it is a competitive process , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , extracurricular activities , etc ., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate for my disability .
tr	Neut	I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Neut	It has been a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future .

tr	Neut	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .
tr	Neut	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?
tr	Neut	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
tr	Neut	My concern with adding the language below is , could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate ??
tr	Neut	In discussion with Dave , we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers .
tr	Neut	Here it is .
tr	Neut	It incorporates Mr . Stojic ' s and Mr . Kelly ' s initial comments .
tr	Neut	Please review it and let me know if you have any comments on or before Tuesday afternoon ( I will be out of the office Monday ).
tr	Neut	Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer ' s duplicity , but after tempers cooled , MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response .
tr	Neut	As it stands , MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers .
tr	Neut	Yea -- it was outstanding news !
tr	Neut	Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC ?
tr	Neut	If so , I will handle it .
tr	Neut	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Neut	Sorry I guess I didn ' t read it very well .
tr	Neut	It ' s ok with me .
tr	Neut	It will give us some weekend reading !
tr	Neut	It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
tr	Neut	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."
tr	Neut	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Neut	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
tr	Neut	I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and , if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure , please let me know .

tr	Neut	I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher , as well , just to make sure it is handled .
tr	Neut	We ' re formatting one this week , and we ' ll send it when it ' s done .

tr	Neut	It ' s a good starting point .
tr	Neut	Here it is -- we printed this 2 - sided and laminated it .
tr	Neut	It looks like the 2 - day L / C issue is an issue .
tr	Neut	Hope you ' ll have time to review it today .
tr	Neut	Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5 ) and the new l / c wording ( drops the 2 day period to replace an l / c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay ).
tr	Neut	( if .....) ( iii ) definitive agreements acceptable to Party A in its sole discretion regarding the debt and all other aspects of [ the project to be owned by Party B ], including but not limited to the senior debt facility , commitments and all project documents , have been fully negotiated and executed and the [ project ] has been brought to financial close .
tr	Neut	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Neut	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Neut	IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
tr	Neut	Rates can ' t go up w / out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion --- trying to finesse it .
tr	Neut	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Neut	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Neut	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Neut	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Neut	It was posted on Dec . 11 , but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet , it is open .
tr	Neut	I ' m not sure how I would have handled it .
tr	Neut	It was now , 8 : 15 and there was no sign of her bus .
tr	Neut	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Neut	7 . Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6 . 2 . 1 .
tr	Neut	12 . Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6 . 1 .
tr	Neut	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Neut	It is Enpower No . 295870 .

tr	Neut	Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts / materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in - service date of May 1 .
tr	Neut	It is a fairly standard , fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar .
tr	Neut	I just couldn ' t remember if it was you or Terry .
tr	Neut	Here it is .
tr	Neut	As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships .
tr	Neut	It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey .
tr	Neut	Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ).
tr	Neut	Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts / materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in - service date of May 1 .

tr	Neut	I can dig it up if you ' d like .
tr	Neut	It ' s a two way street , of course .
tr	Neut	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Neut	It settled anyway , a long time ago .

tr	Neut	Marriage is , in and of itself , a noble concept , but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck .
tr	Neut	It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them .
tr	Neut	It ' s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
tr	Neut	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .
tr	Neut	Probably it is .
tr	Neut	It must be stamped out .
tr	Neut	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Neut	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
tr	Neut	"Seeing another "" Columbia "" incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas )."
tr	Neut	Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems ( as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses ).
tr	Neut	One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one , that there is no separation between you and I , we are all together in this thing called life , we human beings , the birds and the tress , the rocks and the sky , all of it .

tr	Neut	China ' s insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
tr	Neut	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .
tr	Neut	Then , this month , it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran ' s nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
tr	Neut	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Neut	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Neut	This year it overtook Japan as the world ' s second largest consumer of energy , behind the US .
tr	Neut	Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .
tr	Neut	"Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to "" go abroad "" to ensure supply , they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border ."
tr	Neut	China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East .
tr	Neut	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Neut	Increasingly , analysts are saying that China ' s efforts have gone beyond what is safe or even in its own interests .
tr	Neut	""" It may be a difficult political issue but I don ' t think the energy content is worthwhile ."""

tr	Neut	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Neut	Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ), the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
tr	Neut	It surrounds you .
tr	Neut	With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
tr	Neut	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Neut	"Its meaning is "" Infinite happiness is everywhere ""."
tr	Neut	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Neut	Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you ' re repeating it .
tr	Neut	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Neut	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
tr	Neut	It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
tr	Neut	Well maybe a miracle could happen , but lets face it we ' re ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !
tr	Neut	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Neut	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .
tr	Neut	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
tr	Neut	"This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "" secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity .”"
tr	Neut	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Neut	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Neut	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Neut	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Neut	Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
tr	Neut	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .

tr	Neut	China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
tr	Neut	China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China ' s Gansu Province .
tr	Neut	Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .
tr	Neut	But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
tr	Neut	""" They are not going to rush it , because they don ' t want it to be a budget buster ."
tr	Neut	China ' s overtures to join the U . S .- led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country ' s human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat .
tr	Neut	As it turned out , the Soviets never made it to the moon .
tr	Neut	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Neut	Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
tr	Neut	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Neut	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Neut	So , if anyone can give me some advice , I ' d sure appreciate it !
tr	Neut	I ' ve pasted the email for those who haven ' t seen or would like to re - read it .
tr	Neut	It ' s also got the website where the song has been uploaded .
tr	Neut	And what am I DOING about it ?
tr	Neut	"This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
tr	Neut	If anyone wants the complete article , email me , as it is a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy .
tr	Neut	If anyone is interested in listening to this song , and in offering their opinion , whether it be positive or negative , I ' d appreciate it .

tr	Neut	So I checked it out with the U . S . Post Office ( 1 - 800 - 238 - 5355 ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal !!
tr	Neut	Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you need money , you can use it again , and again .

tr	Neut	All you have to do , and It Really works !!!
tr	Neut	Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
tr	Neut	Over time , the wolf ' s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
tr	Neut	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Neut	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Neut	""" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people ,"" Beschta told Blue Planet ."
tr	Neut	It ' s important with regard to the quality of streams .
tr	Neut	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal ' s status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
tr	Neut	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Neut	It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
tr	Neut	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Neut	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non - human natural world to changing conditions , and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming .
tr	Neut	The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to .
tr	Neut	Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat .

tr	Neut	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""

tr	Neut	I didn ' t expect to react that way , but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else looked pretty much like me , it was really very eerie .
tr	Neut	Yes , it ' s a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .

tr	Neut	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Neut	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Neut	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Neut	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Neut	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Neut	"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."
tr	Neut	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Neut	""" More concerning ,"" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy ."
tr	Neut	It is Iran ' s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .
tr	Neut	The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .
tr	Neut	Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2 . 2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .
tr	Neut	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .
tr	Neut	Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 sailors .
tr	Neut	The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .
tr	Neut	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
tr	Neut	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23 , 000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
tr	Neut	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .
tr	Neut	Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
tr	Neut	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .
tr	Neut	More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .
tr	Neut	""" The hardest blow on Americans ,"" concluded Roberts , "" will fall when China does revalue its currency ."
tr	Neut	Should they decide to squeeze , we will all feel it .
tr	Neut	American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .
tr	Neut	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Neut	Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .

tr	Neut	If you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant .
tr	Neut	hi everyone .... just hav my hands on my new OLYMPUS X940 digital camera .. wel , i always wanted 2 hav one by sony .. but anyways , ended up having olympus X940 from my dad ....... does any1 already has it ?
tr	Neut	how has ur experience with it ?
tr	Neut	is it a gud option for casual / formal functions photography ?????
tr	Neut	wht abt its picture quality ???
tr	Neut	is it comparable to sony products or not ??
tr	Neut	it has 14 mega pixel camera ... n 4xwide optical zoom ...
tr	Neut	It is def worth more than the price .
tr	Neut	or it is normal ?
tr	Neut	Are you sure it isn ' t dirt on the sensor ?
tr	Neut	If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can ' t find something in your own field .
tr	Neut	That would be preferable but it doesn ' t matter , could be something similar
tr	Neut	It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Neut	It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa .
tr	Neut	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Neut	A quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it ' s head .
tr	Neut	1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
tr	Neut	And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile !
tr	Neut	Is there any way to strengthen it ?
tr	Neut	3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?
tr	Neut	changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed , mean , sick , or will not want to be around you .

tr	Neut	RP : Is it wrong to want to remove a contact because they are really really stupid ...?
tr	Neut	its definitely not you .
tr	Neut	Its not any of you lol
tr	Neut	it ' s not me is it !?
tr	Neut	can i buy a laptop in u . k and then take it to rep . ireland and put a irish pay , go dongle init ?
tr	Neut	Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
tr	Neut	But word of advice if you ' re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
tr	Neut	Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded .
tr	Neut	I ' m assuming it ' s to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies .
tr	Neut	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Neut	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Neut	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Neut	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Neut	I know that ' s vague , but it depends on the horse .
tr	Neut	Can someone cunclude how long it might take me to save up for the canan t3i or some extra tips to save / gain money ? : O
tr	Neut	It ' s around $ 100 less , which means you get the same camera but quicker !
tr	Neut	Don ' t worry about it .
tr	Neut	does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air ?
tr	Neut	its for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
tr	Neut	"took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ("" the way you would icing "") to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "" mud """
tr	Neut	- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
tr	Neut	- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
tr	Neut	For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm # LGGOBPROJ
tr	Neut	I ' m quite sure , you don ' t even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it ' s edges , the part that is making the noise .
tr	Neut	If yes , you don ' t need to change it because you board later .
tr	Neut	I don ' t remember near which station it is though .
tr	Neut	They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones ?
tr	Neut	It makes a huge difference .
tr	Neut	Problem is , for some reason , the visa process took longer than it should , thus I missed school this semester ( visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn ' t attend ), now I no longer want to go into that school ( because they only would accept me again on September of 2012 ), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012 , can I use the same visa that was issued to me ?
tr	Neut	( in the visa itself , it does not mention anything about which school I m suppose to attend , and problem is , the embassy here in DC are not too nice and would never answer ANY questions ....) any advice please ?
tr	Neut	would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it cant escape i can buy it a wheel
tr	Neut	I ' ve never had a dwarf hamster but I ' ve had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it can ' t out .
tr	Neut	I love this cage , it ' s easy to clean , very spacious and fun for the hamster
tr	Neut	I don ' t know the best way of doing it .
tr	Neut	Would it be best for me to finish college ?
tr	Neut	But right now its the most convenient thing to do .
tr	Neut	What is the best way of doing it ?
tr	Neut	The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
tr	Neut	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Neut	Why is it stil doing this even though I don ' t have the other phone connected ?
tr	Neut	Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well ?
tr	Neut	if everything is filtered , and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there , try doubling up on the filters ...
tr	Neut	It ' s light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera .
tr	Neut	It ' s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you ' re outside .
tr	Neut	My argument is it ' s art and therefore should not be censored he ' s making us censor it who ' s right
tr	Neut	no , it ' s only a body of a young man
tr	Neut	You don ' t think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
tr	Neut	No , it was guys .
tr	Neut	I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments .
tr	Neut	It ' s narrowed down to Butcher and Singer , Davio ' s , and Del Friscos .
tr	Neut	You also don ' t want it getting too warm for him too often .
tr	Neut	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
tr	Neut	It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
tr	Neut	It ' s so much fun over there , and I ' m positive that you ' ll love it ! :)
tr	Neut	It ' s a really huge place over there , and so many visitors / foreigners went to put chains and locks over there !
tr	Neut	It ' s so much fun !
tr	Neut	Everyone loves it ! ^ _ ^
tr	Neut	( It ' s indoors and outdoors !)
tr	Neut	( it ' s all outdoors and the pictures are only a fourth of the real Everland !)
tr	Neut	its really amazing there , itll blow your mind
tr	Neut	it ' s almost like paradise there
tr	Neut	what do I feed it ?
tr	Neut	I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood , its wing is injured , so I ' m currently taking care of it .
tr	Neut	It ' s pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I don ' t know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
tr	Neut	What should I feed it ?
tr	Neut	make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
tr	Neut	its jacks aquarium and pets I believe . ?
tr	Neut	"Stay on it until the "" Saint - Michel Notre - Dame "" station ."
tr	Neut	"Change there to the 13 line toward "" Chatillon Montrouge "" and take it until the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" station ."
tr	Neut	I use GIMP and Its not cutting it , looks terrible .
tr	Neut	It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
tr	Neut	Open your image while it ' s still in color
tr	Neut	I must through it away .
tr	Neut	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Neut	It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive .
tr	Neut	Even if you mash it with a spoon he can ' t do that ,
tr	Neut	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Neut	If you took some Olympic - level horses on a trail ride , they just couldn ' t do it .
tr	Neut	It doesn ' t matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
tr	Neut	I have a 10 gallon filter on it .
tr	Neut	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Neut	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Neut	Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that ' s not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
tr	Neut	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Neut	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Neut	I ' m pretty sure it ' ll be worth it .
tr	Neut	Judging by Nook Tablet ' s processor it ' s supposed to be quite faster !
tr	Neut	Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
tr	Neut	It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
tr	Neut	It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
tr	Neut	If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you won ' t regret it :)
tr	Neut	I ' m getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
tr	Neut	Start up your filter ( sponge filters are the best for bettas ) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
tr	Neut	If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home .
tr	Neut	ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up , they would know
tr	Neut	Add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
tr	Neut	Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang ?
tr	Neut	The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on .
tr	Neut	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Neut	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Neut	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Neut	And do you get charged for it ?
tr	Neut	The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it wouldn ' t work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
tr	Neut	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Neut	It varie $ company to company .
tr	Neut	$ ometime $ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $ involved what $ ome of your money .
tr	Neut	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Neut	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Neut	... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
tr	Neut	Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains !
tr	Neut	So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but its quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
tr	Neut	Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
tr	Neut	Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works .
tr	Neut	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Neut	I don ' t know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don ' t see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
tr	Neut	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Neut	Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it ' s lost so easily !
tr	Neut	like my dogs , they really like me and trust me , but when I open the door to get them outside , they run from me , they know I ' m going to take them outside and they don ' t like it .
tr	Neut	the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage , and birds don ' t usually like cages .
tr	Neut	I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit .
tr	Neut	And when I move it I guess he figures I ' m playing . x . x
tr	Neut	It ' s getting out of hand .
tr	Neut	yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way , hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
tr	Neut	If you use this cage it ' s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
tr	Neut	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Neut	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Neut	i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
tr	Neut	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Neut	from my understanding , if its heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
tr	Neut	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Neut	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Neut	on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
tr	Neut	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
tr	Neut	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Neut	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Neut	We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .
tr	Neut	Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
tr	Neut	I ' m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
tr	Neut	It doesn ' t have to be underground it could be any type of music .
tr	Neut	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Neut	It ' s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
tr	Neut	I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model , and in the game it ' s 3 - shot burst .
tr	Neut	Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it wasn ' t .
tr	Neut	Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
tr	Neut	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Neut	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Neut	I ' m assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , don ' t worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
tr	Neut	Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
tr	Neut	However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and hasn ' t been cleared away yet .
tr	Neut	( ps . I ' m assuming you ' ll stop off in Wellington , and since its summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
tr	Neut	Yes it ' s ok .
tr	Neut	I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
tr	Neut	"It ' s "" tall "" being it ' s bigger than a pony , but it ' s on the small end for a horse ."
tr	Neut	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Neut	If you Don ' t want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
tr	Neut	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Neut	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Neut	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
tr	Neut	"THERE IS NO SUCH THING any more , anywhere , it ’ s an online dating scam ."""
tr	Neut	The below site from the US government verifies this - it ' s the same for Canada , too .....
tr	Neut	It doesn ' t work .
tr	Neut	Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Neut	Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Neut	They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
tr	Neut	When the males aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
tr	Neut	"According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / immigrate / skilled / assess / index . asp , it states "" Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing ."""
tr	Neut	"Why have a "" minimum "" if it is going to be ignored ?"
tr	Neut	Alright , so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it .
tr	Neut	It said it was in January but still !!!!
tr	Neut	So I kept reading and then I saw the dates , it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday . :(
tr	Neut	Enjoy those 2 days it better then not going at all .!
tr	Neut	and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places , i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go . : D
tr	Neut	Well , I mean , you don ' t have to be mad about it .
tr	Neut	Enjoy it while you can , and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time .
tr	Neut	If they don ' t like it , it ' ll only be two days , remember ?
tr	Neut	Have a look at this , it may help .
tr	Neut	"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann ."
tr	Neut	Hope it helps !
tr	Neut	i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country .
tr	Neut	It is free .
tr	Neut	In all my travels I ’ ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
tr	Neut	So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
tr	Neut	So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T . V ., it ’ s probably because of the sounds .
tr	Neut	Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
tr	Neut	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Neut	HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
tr	Neut	so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40K at least .
tr	Neut	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Neut	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Neut	It was an evolution .
tr	Neut	I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
tr	Neut	However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
tr	Neut	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Neut	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Neut	we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
tr	Neut	Molten brass is damn hot and usually it ' s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
tr	Neut	Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
tr	Neut	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Neut	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Neut	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e . g . for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ).
tr	Neut	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ).
tr	Neut	I melt brass and cast it http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm
tr	Neut	You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
tr	Neut	Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
tr	Neut	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Neut	Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
tr	Neut	I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
tr	Neut	I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
tr	Neut	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Neut	It will become EU law in a couple of years .
tr	Neut	Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
tr	Neut	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Neut	Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
tr	Neut	Be persistent , but don ' t pester them about it cause that ' ll get you nowhere fast .
tr	Neut	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Neut	Once you ' re holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
tr	Neut	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Neut	"Ok so if youre snake will take pre - killed , you can "" gas it ""."
tr	Neut	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
tr	Neut	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Neut	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Neut	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Neut	My opinion - take it for what it ' s worth … :-)
tr	Neut	"It is full of gay friendly "" everything ""."
tr	Neut	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Neut	Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
tr	Neut	It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
tr	Neut	Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .
tr	Neut	I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it didn ' t help .
tr	Neut	Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
tr	Neut	Must say , in Delhi it ' s hard to get good price / quality rating .
tr	Neut	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Neut	In Agra I ' ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
tr	Neut	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Neut	It was quite easy to find something .
tr	Neut	Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
tr	Neut	it is in karol bagh .
tr	Neut	some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it .
tr	Neut	it is centrally situated .
tr	Neut	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
tr	Neut	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Neut	Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT !
tr	Neut	That ' s kind of the way it goes .. lol .
tr	Neut	For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
tr	Neut	It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
tr	Neut	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Neut	If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , its simple to do it over the computer .
tr	Neut	For $ 56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
tr	Neut	You can probably do it all on - line .
tr	Neut	My parents didn ' t send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment .
tr	Neut	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Neut	As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
tr	Neut	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Neut	The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
tr	Neut	The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ).
tr	Neut	Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
tr	Neut	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Neut	We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it .
tr	Neut	How could we make it settle in a new house .
tr	Neut	they just do it on their own .
tr	Neut	Its very frustrating .
tr	Neut	I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog .
tr	Neut	Later do it again .
tr	Neut	If you push it , it will never work .
tr	Neut	or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
tr	Neut	I have taken this tour and it was great .
tr	Neut	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Neut	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Neut	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Neut	PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken ' s hotel .
tr	Neut	It ' s called Kiwi Heaven and it ' s across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
tr	Neut	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Neut	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Neut	I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
tr	Neut	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Neut	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Neut	Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
tr	Neut	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Neut	If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
tr	Neut	BTW you dont want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
tr	Neut	When I first started doing it I ' d do it every day .
tr	Neut	Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
tr	Neut	with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it ' s forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
tr	Neut	I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water .
tr	Neut	The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
tr	Neut	Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
tr	Neut	1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
tr	Neut	2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn ' t think it would be helpful .
tr	Neut	It could be due to nausea or any number of things .
tr	Neut	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
tr	Neut	My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
tr	Neut	Is it true ?
tr	Neut	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Neut	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Neut	""" Non !"" means "" non "", not "" I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case ."""
tr	Neut	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there ' s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
tr	Neut	Why not just take your chances and do it your way ?
tr	Neut	it ' s very logical .
tr	Neut	I ' ve also considered becoming a teacher , but it ' s not a job I ' m cut out for .
tr	Neut	And it ' s not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
tr	Neut	Try living in Sydney on a teacher ' s salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
tr	Neut	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Neut	And they ' re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
tr	Neut	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Neut	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it ' s not anything new .
tr	Neut	It depends on what you hunger for .
tr	Neut	as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
tr	Neut	They can smell it so i ' m sure he knows what it is and just don ' t want it .
tr	Neut	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Neut	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
tr	Neut	Its body will be dull looking , too .
tr	Neut	In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
tr	Neut	It ' s natural and so long as you don ' t see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
tr	Neut	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Neut	It ' s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
tr	Neut	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
tr	Neut	make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
tr	Neut	It means they ' ve gone too far .
tr	Neut	Thing is , it worked .
tr	Neut	The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ).
tr	Neut	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Neut	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Neut	Try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
tr	Neut	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Neut	"My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the "" sun rays "" he needs ?"
tr	Neut	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Neut	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Neut	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Neut	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Neut	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Neut	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Neut	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Neut	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Neut	Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so its anyone ' s guess whether or not he ' ll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
tr	Neut	I tell all my customers they can try it , but don ' t count on it .
tr	Neut	At first it was all cool and all .
tr	Neut	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Neut	I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
tr	Neut	This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them .
tr	Neut	Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .
tr	Neut	After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
tr	Neut	and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
tr	Neut	They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
tr	Neut	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Neut	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Neut	It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
tr	Neut	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Neut	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Neut	Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid - July – again , it ’ s all part of the uncertainty principle .
tr	Neut	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Neut	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
tr	Neut	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Neut	It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
tr	Neut	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
tr	Neut	The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
tr	Neut	You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
tr	Neut	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Neut	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Neut	Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult ' s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
tr	Neut	Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5 . 8 to 10 . 6 DH should be fine for gardneri .
tr	Neut	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Neut	If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
tr	Neut	It is vacation time .
tr	Neut	From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more .
tr	Neut	It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
tr	Neut	It is really an entertainment for the kids .
tr	Neut	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Neut	We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
tr	Neut	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Neut	but food is always available and it is consistently good .
tr	Neut	It ' s a father and son business .
tr	Neut	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Neut	Ok , calm down , it ' s not like he ' s some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
tr	Neut	"It ' s always just "" Okay , they ' re feet need to be done , better call the farrier ."""
tr	Neut	sorta wonder what it would have been like ?
tr	Neut	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Neut	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Neut	EPM , Anyone Dealt with it ?
tr	Neut	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Neut	Think I should do it ?
tr	Neut	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Neut	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Neut	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Neut	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Neut	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Neut	If so go for it and I ' ll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .
tr	Neut	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Neut	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
tr	Neut	As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we ' ve had to deal with it .
tr	Neut	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Neut	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Neut	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Neut	Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?
tr	Neut	Was it always like this ?
tr	Neut	Or has it occurred since birth .
tr	Neut	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Neut	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .
tr	Neut	It came out better than I even imagined .
tr	Neut	its great to know you can get great service , great product , and for the best price all in one !
tr	Neut	I have been here 3 to 4 times and every time food they served seems warmed up not cooked after you order it .
tr	Neut	We attend LFTD and our children LOVE it !!
tr	Neut	Had a meal in this pub and i have to say it was excellant .
tr	Neut	It has to be one of the nicest pubs that i have been into in a long time , the decor is nice and it has a really nice garden and a lovely decking area .
tr	Neut	Incredibly rude and I will not return to it .
tr	Neut	The team at Bradley Chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death !
tr	Neut	They close whenever they feel like it , often well before their listed closing time .
tr	Neut	I don ' t get it .
tr	Neut	It is busy every day at lunch for a reason , the service is fast and the food is great .
tr	Neut	It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
tr	Neut	It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others .
tr	Neut	I would have had to because with the economy the way it is i aint haves much monies fo repairs round the House ....
tr	Neut	and it works !
tr	Neut	No amount of sugar and milk can mask it .
tr	Neut	Westfield and Rt 1 do it well , WHY CANT U ????
tr	Neut	Hair By Nivine in eastgardens fixed my hair after i had my hair cut and colored at another salon i felt more confident and the girls are fantastic and ive been going there now for 2 years always happy and they care about my hair had my hair done for my wedding it looked fabolous !
tr	Neut	I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances .
tr	Neut	I ' ma soccer mom so I wasn ' t sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear .
tr	Neut	I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer .
tr	Neut	we purchased a new home but was unable to sell our old house so we contacted this property management company and they have helped us quickly rent out our house and keep it maintained .
tr	Neut	From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
tr	Neut	It wasn ' t until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you .
tr	Neut	Yes , they accepted it .
tr	Neut	Then , they sold me overpriced stuffs , such as oil tank cap , so that my car can pass it right away .
tr	Neut	I don ' t get it .
tr	Neut	It ' s impossible to get an appointment .
tr	Neut	It ' s the best meal for the money you will find in all of metro Atlanta .
tr	Neut	It is very clean , staff is friendly , and I have never waited !
tr	Neut	I go every other week for the shallac / gel manicure which is only $ 25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks !
tr	Neut	I love it .
tr	Neut	November 7 , 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience .
tr	Neut	Maybe next time they will have it .
tr	Neut	It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive !!
tr	Neut	It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal !
tr	Neut	We sat in the front dining area , it was very cozy and pleasant .
tr	Neut	brought dog home and its all choppy now !
tr	Neut	It ' s helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting .
tr	Neut	If you watch a lot of fights ( youtube ) and research some of the history ( http :// en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bullfighting ) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more !
tr	Neut	Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .
tr	Neut	It was a no brainer really .
tr	Neut	It ' s dark , dingy & dirty .
tr	Neut	"This place may have been something sometime ; but it way past it "" sell by date ""."
tr	Neut	I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it .
tr	Neut	it wasent going an had a gear box problem ....
tr	Neut	i coldn ' t find anywere else local to fix it so i took it there and they fixed it for $ 150 ...
tr	Neut	When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
tr	Neut	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Neut	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
tr	Neut	I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see ??
tr	Neut	THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE , I GUARANTEE IT .
tr	Neut	I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
tr	Neut	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
tr	Neut	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Neut	I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like its getting infected .
tr	Neut	This town needs some food soul and this is not it .
tr	Neut	I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
tr	Neut	It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Neut	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Neut	Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
tr	Neut	It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
tr	Neut	That did it for me .. no more Raina ' s .
tr	Neut	The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
tr	Neut	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Neut	I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
tr	Neut	The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
tr	Neut	When i say jiu - jitsu or mma i mean it !
tr	Neut	Best jiu - jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up !
tr	Neut	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Neut	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Neut	Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
tr	Neut	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
tr	Neut	SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
tr	Neut	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
tr	Neut	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
tr	Neut	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Neut	A bit pricey , so I didn ' t go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
tr	Neut	I ' m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
tr	Neut	Don ' t even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
tr	Neut	Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got it .
tr	Neut	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
tr	Neut	Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
tr	Neut	A lack of organisation , coupled with the distain for its customers , makes this the worst rental agency I have used .
tr	Neut	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Neut	Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
tr	Neut	But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
tr	Neut	It ' s located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
tr	Neut	It ' s durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
tr	Neut	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Neut	They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS , they will NOT take it back !
tr	Neut	My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
tr	Neut	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
tr	Neut	We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it ' s worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
tr	Neut	It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
tr	Neut	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
tr	Neut	I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
tr	Neut	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
tr	Neut	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
tr	Neut	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Neut	Took a bite , it tasted odd .
tr	Neut	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
tr	Neut	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Neut	Now , I won ' t eat fast food Chinese unless it ' s from this place .
tr	Neut	My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
tr	Neut	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Neut	I HATED SUSHI BEFORE BUT NOW I CANT STOP EATTING IT !!!!!!!
tr	Neut	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ), but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
tr	Neut	Only if it is of the quality of That ' s Amore .
tr	Neut	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Neut	If you ' ve been to North County , chances are it ' s in your favorites list already .
tr	Neut	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Neut	I rated it 5 stars .
tr	Neut	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Neut	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Neut	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Neut	They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won ' t hurt my score .
tr	Neut	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Neut	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Neut	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Neut	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Neut	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Neut	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn ' ta fps .
tr	Neut	Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we ' d try it .
tr	Neut	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Neut	It ' s pretty ridiculous !
tr	Neut	"I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "" AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ."
tr	Neut	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Neut	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Neut	# 1 its immaculately clean .
tr	Neut	TRY THIS PLACE - YOU ' LL LOVE IT .
tr	Neut	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
tr	Neut	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Neut	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Neut	Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that doesn ' t impress me .
tr	Neut	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Neut	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Neut	It would have been more than one could bear !
tr	Neut	It ' s not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
tr	Neut	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Neut	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Neut	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Neut	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Neut	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Neut	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Neut	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
tr	Neut	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
tr	Neut	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I ' ve always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
tr	Neut	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Neut	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Neut	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Neut	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Neut	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Neut	It ' s pretty combative actually .
tr	Neut	you ' ll love it
tr	Neut	With these fusions , chiropractric isn ' t as successful , but it still is very helpful .
tr	Neut	Even after my fusions , my back continued to hurt , but now it doesn ' t hurt any more .
tr	Neut	"I regularly request Kim ' s business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!!"""
tr	Neut	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
tr	Neut	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Neut	( it ' s by the door , on the hostess stand )
tr	Neut	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Neut	I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
tr	Neut	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
tr	Neut	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
tr	Neut	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Neut	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Neut	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Neut	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Neut	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Neut	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Neut	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Neut	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Neut	We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
tr	Neut	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Neut	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Neut	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Neut	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Neut	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
tr	Neut	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Neut	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Neut	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Neut	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Neut	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Neut	( For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me !)
tr	Neut	The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
tr	Neut	Very affordable ( don ' t call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
tr	Neut	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Neut	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
tr	Neut	This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
tr	Neut	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Neut	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Neut	However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
tr	Neut	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Neut	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Neut	On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
tr	Neut	I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
tr	Neut	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
tr	Neut	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
tr	Neut	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Neut	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Neut	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Neut	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Neut	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Neut	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Neut	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
tr	Neut	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Neut	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
tr	Neut	It wasn ' t completly impossible !!!!
tr	Neut	After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
tr	Neut	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Neut	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Neut	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
tr	Neut	On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
tr	Neut	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Neut	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Neut	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Neut	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Neut	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Neut	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Neut	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever its like driving a new car .
tr	Neut	After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , its less dry & smoother !
tr	Neut	Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
tr	Neut	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife ' s work and towed it back to fix it .
tr	Neut	Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything , and smile while doing it .
tr	Neut	However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
tr	Neut	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
tr	Neut	I brought it back with 9000 miles .
tr	Neut	I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
tr	Neut	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Neut	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Neut	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Neut	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
tr	Neut	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
tr	Neut	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Neut	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Neut	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
tr	Neut	not only is this place too expensive for what it is , its horrible !
tr	Neut	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Neut	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Neut	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Neut	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
tr	Neut	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Neut	How much could it possibly cost ?
tr	Neut	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Neut	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
tr	Neut	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
tr	Neut	Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
tr	Neut	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Neut	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
tr	Neut	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell ' s .
tr	Neut	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Neut	It is also the largest .
tr	Neut	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
tr	Neut	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Neut	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Neut	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Neut	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Neut	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Neut	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Neut	Stop in and have a bite you won ' t regret it .
tr	Neut	I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
tr	Neut	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Neut	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Neut	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Neut	On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
tr	Neut	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
tr	Neut	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Neut	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Neut	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Neut	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend ' s aunt recommended it .
tr	Neut	It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
tr	Neut	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
tr	Neut	I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier .
tr	Neut	No problem , sounded like it ' s done every day .
tr	Neut	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Neut	I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
tr	Neut	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Neut	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Neut	I think they ' re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
tr	Neut	They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it ' s not room temperature at best when you get it home .
tr	Neut	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical !
tr	Neut	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Neut	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Neut	It ' s just not worth it .
tr	Neut	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Neut	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Neut	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Neut	Please do not go there if it ' s professional , friendly , diligent medical services you ' re looking for .
tr	Neut	That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
tr	Neut	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Neut	We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
tr	Neut	Do not live here , you will regret it !
tr	Neut	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Neut	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
tr	Neut	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Neut	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Neut	It tasted like I just flew back home .
tr	Neut	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Neut	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
tr	Neut	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Neut	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
tr	Neut	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Neut	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Neut	BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
tr	Neut	its like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
tr	Neut	it seems like its healthier too , but its prolly not .
tr	Neut	also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it delivered **.
tr	Neut	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Neut	their pizza was a little salty for me , but its still good .
tr	Neut	anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
tr	Neut	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
tr	Neut	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Neut	My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100 , 000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
tr	Neut	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Neut	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Neut	It sucked having an SUV .
tr	Neut	If I found a spot , I couldnt fit in it .
tr	Neut	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Neut	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Neut	It ' s without a doubt , the best service experience I ' ve ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville ' s price for putting on the other rear tire .
tr	Neut	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Neut	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Neut	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Neut	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Neut	I mean , that ' s the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
tr	Neut	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Neut	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Neut	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Neut	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
tr	Neut	Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
tr	Neut	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Neut	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Neut	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Neut	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Neut	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Neut	How has it gone so far ?
tr	Neut	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Neut	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Neut	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Neut	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Neut	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Neut	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Neut	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Neut	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone elses .
tr	Neut	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
tr	Neut	We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
tr	Neut	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Neut	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Neut	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
tr	Neut	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
tr	Neut	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Neut	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Neut	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Neut	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Neut	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
tr	Neut	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Neut	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
tr	Neut	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Neut	I wasn ' t going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
tr	Neut	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
tr	Neut	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Neut	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Neut	On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
tr	Neut	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Neut	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Neut	"Gerry pleasantly said "" since I am already here why don ' t we give it shot ."
tr	Neut	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Neut	But we don ' t just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
tr	Neut	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Neut	Because we think IT ' S THE BEST !!!
tr	Neut	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Neut	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Neut	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Neut	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Neut	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Neut	No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so isn ' t it reasonable to think they might know what they ' re doing ?
tr	Neut	I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
tr	Neut	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Neut	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Neut	Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
tr	Neut	Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
tr	Neut	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Neut	If you go later , it ' s all cleaned up .
tr	Neut	It ' s an entirely up and down experience , however .
tr	Neut	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).
tr	Neut	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Neut	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Neut	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
tr	Neut	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Neut	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Neut	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Neut	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Neut	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Neut	They promised it ' d be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
tr	Neut	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Neut	Of course I couldn ' t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ).
tr	Neut	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Neut	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .

tr	Fem	How could I work with her to get off her four hand , get balance , and lope smoothly and slowly ??
tr	Fem	Put on a pair of spurs and before she makes that trot step , it ' s in the feeling when you feel her think trot , tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving .

tr	Fem	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Fem	Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
tr	Fem	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Fem	In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .
tr	Fem	[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
tr	Fem	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .

tr	Fem	When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
tr	Fem	She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
tr	Fem	My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .

tr	Fem	Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .

tr	Fem	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .
tr	Fem	She tosses me around like its nothing !
tr	Fem	Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc ..'
tr	Fem	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Fem	She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
tr	Fem	She is also nicer when we are both alone .
tr	Fem	However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
tr	Fem	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
tr	Fem	My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along .
tr	Fem	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
tr	Fem	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
tr	Fem	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
tr	Fem	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
tr	Fem	Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
tr	Fem	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Fem	If she is nicer when you are alone I ' d say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
tr	Fem	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Fem	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Fem	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Fem	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Fem	giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
tr	Fem	put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
tr	Fem	then let her out for ten minutes .
tr	Fem	this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
tr	Fem	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn ' t now .
tr	Fem	she knows she is invading someone else ' s territory , but can ' t help it , and has no where to go .
tr	Fem	she will be able to sleep without being afraid .
tr	Fem	your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
tr	Fem	putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .
tr	Fem	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Fem	The real testament is not in how much she likes your animals but how much they like her .
tr	Fem	I highly recommend her .

tr	Fem	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
tr	Fem	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Fem	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
tr	Fem	I can ' t say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
tr	Fem	Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me !!!!
tr	Fem	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
tr	Fem	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Fem	She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
tr	Fem	You should give her a try - it ' s worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
tr	Fem	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Fem	I know that ' s ugly ... but she won ' t help you out for anything ... sad story .
tr	Fem	She may be the reason for all the change .

tr	Fem	She did a great job !
tr	Fem	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Fem	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Fem	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Fem	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Fem	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
tr	Fem	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Fem	I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
tr	Fem	I would recommend her highly !
tr	Fem	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
tr	Fem	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Fem	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Fem	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Fem	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Fem	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
tr	Fem	She recommended products but absolutely didn ' t pressure me to buy .
tr	Fem	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
tr	Fem	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren ' t paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
tr	Fem	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Fem	She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
tr	Fem	The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
tr	Fem	Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
tr	Fem	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Fem	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Fem	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Fem	My dental surgeon , Dr . Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
tr	Fem	Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
tr	Fem	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
tr	Fem	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Fem	The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
tr	Fem	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Fem	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Fem	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Fem	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Fem	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Fem	What I like most about Dr . Liau is that she is very caring .
tr	Fem	She talks to you at each appointment .
tr	Fem	I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
tr	Fem	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Fem	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Fem	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
tr	Fem	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
tr	Fem	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
tr	Fem	The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
tr	Fem	Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
tr	Fem	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Fem	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Fem	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
tr	Fem	Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
tr	Fem	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
tr	Fem	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
tr	Fem	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Fem	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
tr	Fem	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Fem	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
tr	Fem	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Fem	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Fem	With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
tr	Fem	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Fem	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Fem	YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
tr	Fem	She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
tr	Fem	Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we don ' t go past broad ?
tr	Fem	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Fem	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M , no exceptions .
tr	Fem	Then she was gone .
tr	Fem	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Fem	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Fem	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
va	Masc	He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they didn ' t .
va	Masc	Today ' s incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace .
va	Masc	""" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison ,"" he added ."
va	Masc	He added that around 1 , 100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
va	Masc	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Masc	In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
va	Masc	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Masc	North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
va	Masc	At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
va	Masc	This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn ' t anticipated .
va	Masc	He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
va	Masc	So he ' s got a -- I ' m a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
va	Masc	"And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "" A Charge to Keep ""?"
va	Masc	"That was the name of his "" autobiography "" -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 ."
va	Masc	He announced this in January :
va	Masc	He also announced this in January :
va	Masc	"' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group ' s "" striking arm "" in Iraq ."
va	Masc	Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas .
va	Masc	""" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same ,"" al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad ."
va	Masc	He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
va	Masc	And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
va	Masc	However , he also mentioned we were a close sixth , that is close to the fifth highest bid .
va	Masc	He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid .
va	Masc	He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure .
va	Masc	"I used to e - mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article "" The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives "" and he had mailed me the copy ."
va	Masc	What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo ' s resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer .
va	Masc	When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group .
va	Masc	One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship .
va	Masc	He came across as a very bright person , very personable .
va	Masc	I can take him as a summer intern .
va	Masc	He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments .
va	Masc	During the preliminary interrogation , Lone ' confessed ' his involvement in the blasts and gave several vital clues .
va	Masc	He has also had to pay the £ 15 each up front so woul d be grateful if you could get the cash to him as soon as poss ible .
va	Masc	He comes with everything , litter box , carrier , ect .
va	Masc	"Like you said "" the kids egg him on ""."
va	Masc	Maybe he doesn ' t want to play when they want to ..
va	Masc	"He didn ' t take a dislike to the kids for "" no "" reason !"
va	Masc	The former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is refusing to enter the Baghdad courtroom , in protest at how his trial is being conducted .
va	Masc	"If Abbas keeps up this "" macho talk "" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank ."
va	Masc	Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan . 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec . 25 , 2004 .
va	Masc	Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat ' s legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood .
va	Masc	He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
va	Masc	Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel ' s partially completed West Bank barrier .
va	Masc	"Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue "" very important and very dangerous ."""
va	Masc	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
va	Masc	Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .
va	Masc	i could call him r2 for short
va	Masc	I was unsure of what he should wear , it says business casual but that can be interpreted in many different ways .
va	Masc	He deserved respect
va	Masc	What is your cats name and why did you name him / her that ?
va	Masc	I have a Norwegian Forest Cat that is named Achilles bc as a kitten he always attacked your feet when you walked by !
va	Masc	My cats Called Frank because the year we got him was the year Frank Sinatra died
va	Masc	He also had bright blue eyes like Frank Sinatra did :)
va	Masc	if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs .
va	Masc	Well last night while I was sleeping , my hamster escaped from his cage .
va	Masc	He is in my room , but there are so many things inside there , I dunno what to do .
va	Masc	Find him before he finds the dog food .
va	Masc	Make sure he isn ' t trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out .
va	Masc	He will come and eat
va	Masc	He ' s been away for a week and I was thinking of waiting for him in his apartment wearing only his dress shirt .
va	Masc	I just dont want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable .
va	Masc	Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner , or a light snack at his house .
va	Masc	He ' s great !
va	Masc	Dr . Dorn is his backup .
va	Masc	I definitely recommend him :)
va	Masc	He cross examined witnesses relentlessly and had them break down and tell the truth .
va	Masc	He worked on it right on the back of my car .
va	Masc	He is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the repairs to me .
va	Masc	The work on my car was done quickly and I felt I could trust his work .
va	Masc	I highly recommend his shop .
va	Fem	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Fem	Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
va	Fem	The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
va	Fem	Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20 , 000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
va	Fem	jill allen finishes her cpa today and she and her friends are going to party .
va	Fem	Further , she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement , which reads in part : Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind , should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and / or is subject to liens .
va	Fem	She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re - wording of Section 7 .
va	Fem	Catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in PR .
va	Fem	Jackie Taylor - she is located at Court House Concessionaire and under her name in the directory .
va	Fem	I have a friend that has to get rid of one of her cats because of allergies , he is the youngest at 3 years old black , long hair , incredibly friendly .
va	Fem	You can ' t but here ' s an update : The doctor is about to discover the affair between her husband and Jo ( who has become her new best friend ).
va	Fem	When she was a tiny little kitten she looked like those twinky snack cakes .
va	Fem	She is a creme tabby and I ' ve had her for over 2 years now .
va	Fem	I have a siamese lynx name Star we called her that because she has a star pattern on her face .
va	Fem	And she is the STAR of the family .
va	Fem	I love her . :)
va	Fem	If she has no male to fertilize the eggs , the eggs will aways be infertile .
va	Fem	Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny !
va	Fem	If she continues !
va	Fem	I go to see her to have my hair cut .
va	Fem	She ' s an A + and so are her clothes !
va	Fem	She answers all questions asked and provides the best service i have ever seen .
va	Fem	I have a new born daughter and she helped me with a lot .
va	Fem	She has a great way with children and is able to capture their personality as well as many spontaneous images .
va	Fem	You will not be disappointed with her work !!
va	Fem	Barb does an AMAZING JOB , she is always learning new things on how to use her hands and body , to give every person an AWESOME MASSAGE , CALL TODAY AND SCHEDULE YOU MUST SEE HER , YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE SHE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST !
va	Fem	I recommend you to everyone in Calgary , as she is a professional and the cost for her was low .
va	Neut	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Neut	Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company ' s story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who haven ' t heard it .
va	Neut	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Neut	"Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror ."""
va	Neut	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Neut	That ' s overstating it , I know .
va	Neut	What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it ' s always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
va	Neut	Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
va	Neut	It ' s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
va	Neut	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
va	Neut	""" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ?"""
va	Neut	When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
va	Neut	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’ s ever seen .
va	Neut	It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
va	Neut	It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
va	Neut	It ' s a Western scene by a guy named W . H . S . Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Neut	It ' s on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O ' Neill in Midland , Texas .
va	Neut	""" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep ."
va	Neut	And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
va	Neut	It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
va	Neut	Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it ' s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
va	Neut	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Neut	They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
va	Neut	It ' s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
va	Neut	It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis - matches .
va	Neut	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
va	Neut	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
va	Neut	Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ).
va	Neut	There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don ' t want to fall into it .
va	Neut	But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
va	Neut	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
va	Neut	The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
va	Neut	"Work it into your speech -- something along the line of , "" And Jen , you come from great people and have fantastic friends ."
va	Neut	no , i am not kidding and no i don ' t want it b / c of the taco bell dog .
va	Neut	i want it b / c it is really small and cute .
va	Neut	i knew someone in college who had one and i loved it .
va	Neut	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Neut	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Neut	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .
va	Neut	plus we can be outside watching it .

va	Neut	You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment ..

va	Neut	Can you send me the data you used : I shall take a look at it .
va	Neut	It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter .
va	Neut	Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer .
va	Neut	It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector .
va	Neut	Again , it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school .

va	Neut	It is easy to get discount airfare for them since they travel very frequently .
va	Neut	I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet .
va	Neut	The test itself is what is called a substitution test .
va	Neut	It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
va	Neut	I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it .
va	Neut	A person can take it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA .
va	Neut	i dont know what it is , but since a very young age i have had a strange but very gratifying urge to torture or maime animals .
va	Neut	Currently , I am writing a book on natural supplements to aid weight loss , with Harry Preuss , MD , a Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University ; it is scheduled for publication by Broadway ( Random House ) in January 2007 .

va	Neut	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Neut	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Neut	NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
va	Neut	""" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ], but I do not expect it ,"" Griffin added ."
va	Neut	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
va	Neut	Normally this author is semi - objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi . com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ).
va	Neut	It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
va	Neut	Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory .
va	Neut	In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
va	Neut	"Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "" unrestricted "" strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight ."
va	Neut	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Neut	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Neut	""" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda ."""
va	Neut	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."
va	Neut	... Nope and I am proud of it ... because my teacher havent taught us that yet ...

va	Neut	It ' s my two year anniversary in a few days and was wondering if somone could tell me about a great restaurant in sf or other nearby cities
va	Neut	I like Hayes Street Grill .... another plus , it ' s right by Civic Center , so you can take a romantic walk around the Opera House , City Hall , Symphony Auditorium ... all very beautiful .
va	Neut	its kind of expensive though
va	Neut	It would be similar to flying the flag of the Third Reich in modern day Germany or in Israel .
va	Neut	The police would make you take it down and you may face fines and imprisonment ( but definitely not execution .)
va	Neut	Yes , it would be an execution punishment .
va	Neut	It closed on Sunday ...
va	Neut	I ' ve tried calling them a week ago , they said they can ' t give me those details over the phone , or let me know , keep asking me to go to some website , but there ' s nothing useful on it
va	Neut	Why not look it up !
va	Neut	maybe it ' s beacuse you love to work with animals and you just can ' t be ha [[ y if you weren ' t soing that job
va	Neut	Try Varkala , its a ammazing and is by the beach .
va	Neut	Just because you have a male and female , it cannot be guaranteed the two mated .
va	Neut	You can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light .
va	Neut	If you see a dark spot in the egg , that means it is fertilized and will hatch if cared for properly .
va	Neut	I ' m not sure about the origin of the name but they are a lot of different cities with different and unique names like Miramar so it ' s just a name .
va	Neut	There ' s lots of towns called Miramar , it ' d help alot if you listed a state or some sort of context you ' re looking for it in .
va	Neut	ok well i have a crush on 2 guys but unforchunitly it is almost valentines day afnd i just broke up with my and i have dated one of theguys i like and one guy lives in my naborhood guy i need your help i am a girl but i need a guys help what shoul i do ?
va	Neut	it may sound like a bad idea
va	Neut	is it still available ?
va	Neut	because i have read that there are times its not available .
va	Neut	if its not available is there nearby alternative to store my luggage ?
va	Neut	Pay attention , altough there are automatic storage , you can only pay with coins ( they ' re now installing some where you ' ll be able to pay with credit card , but it ' s sporadic now .
va	Neut	I don ' t know , and it is because I don ' t like them , do you know that , morcillas is coagulated blood from animals , ewww
va	Neut	it is not frequent .
va	Neut	I have wifi at my house , but thats just at my house ... is there anyway i can buy some card to make the ipod itself have wifi ?
va	Neut	i want to be able to use it in my car , out n about etc ... i guess like an iphone , but thats later on and , i know what they are so no suggestions on just goin out to buy one im talking about right now just for an ipod ??.
va	Neut	You gotta get an iPhone for 3G ... only way ... actually there is a thing that you pay for monthly that gets wifi from satellite and you can connect to it anywhere but you have to Cary it with you
va	Neut	WILL SOMEONE PLZ HELP ME IT ' S DUE WENSDAY !?!?! :(
va	Neut	what does it mean when a veiled chameleon egg is soft ?
va	Neut	If you take a flash light and shine it through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away !
va	Neut	It ' ll take you to all the major sites ( GG Bridge , Haight , Chinatown , etc ) and you can get off anyplace you want to spend more time at .
va	Neut	It ' s an amazing experience !
va	Neut	Is it better to book a cruise online or by a travel agent ?
va	Neut	I ' m not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down in the basement and it was as big as a rat .
va	Neut	It had been eating dog food the whole time .
va	Neut	It was huge and scared the crap out of me .
va	Neut	the easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly , feed it the right amt , etc etc x
va	Neut	Its still a fairly new relationship and we havent had sex yet so its kind of a big deal .
va	Neut	Is it ok for a woman in french culture to make the first move ?
va	Neut	French women are the ones to say yes , the way we say it is not usually as straigthforward as you propose to do .
va	Neut	And you take it up from there .
va	Neut	Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol .
va	Neut	it is now bislas .
va	Neut	long lines on the weekends but worth it
va	Neut	Really enjoyed it .
va	Neut	can ' t remember good or bad , so it must have been meh .
va	Neut	Most of all , my daughter loves it !
va	Neut	Loved every bit of it . :)
va	Neut	Its fab !
va	Neut	The best pizza ever im fat so ive had a ton of pizza other than pizza from chicago its the best
va	Neut	It made me feel good to see people work so hard to take care of others belongings .
va	Neut	It ' s now called Sushi Lover .
va	Neut	Food is just okay .. won ' t crave it , but wouldn ' t mind coming back for a quick meal .
va	Neut	Its the only pizza place I recommend in Woodland Hills .
va	Neut	Lied right to my face then denied it .
va	Neut	So i booked the lesson and loved it .
va	Neut	It ' s fine for ...
va	Neut	It ' s fine for mass - market chocolate , but with companies like Scharffen Berger , TCHO , and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area , why ?
va	Neut	it was worth of the ride more than an hour ...
va	Neut	It is , surprisingly , near the Blue Water Bridges , some miles to the west of this location .
va	Neut	It ' s fresh and really tasty .
va	Neut	But otherwise , it can feel pricey for what you get .
va	Neut	How much better does it get ?!
va	Neut	I loved the atmosphere here and the food is good , however the tables are so close together that it feels very cramped .
va	Neut	Luckily I live very close , so I can abuse it during week - ends ...
va	Neut	Happened on to this place while out of town on business , and it was great !
va	Neut	It is a cloth napkin kind of place , but I thought well worth it .
va	Neut	It was ok , nice management , they let us check in early , but the place was old .
va	Neut	It was clean , but just a little dumpy .
va	Neut	What a neat gem of a restaurant in a corner one wouldn ' t expect it .
va	Neut	It clearly had been prepared from fresh ingredients .
va	Neut	They offer a good portions at a great price , it ' s enough food to fill you up , but you don ' t ever feel like you ate too much .
va	Neut	Plus , it ' s super healthy !
va	Neut	it ' s passable as a pub , but the pizza is not that great .
va	Neut	Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for this dentist ( a HUGE number compared to the others in the area ), but that they all have the same unique grammar structure ?
va	Neut	Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in .
va	Neut	I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my receipt was $ 8 . 95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show $ 10 . 74 .
va	Neut	I took my Mustang here and it looked amazing after they were done , they did a great job , I ' m very satisfied with the results .
te	Neut	What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e - mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
te	Neut	This BuzzMachine post argues that Google ' s rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we ' ve all heard before , but it ' s particularly well - put in this post .
te	Neut	Does anybody use it for anything else ?
te	Neut	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Neut	Click here To view it .
te	Neut	( You don ' t need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you don ' t need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you ' re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ).
te	Neut	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Neut	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
te	Neut	But we can ' t prove it .
te	Neut	It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof .
te	Neut	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Neut	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v . Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D . C . Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
te	Neut	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
te	Neut	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Neut	It ' s just disappointing .
te	Neut	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Neut	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Neut	It doesn ' t change the company ' s intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
te	Neut	On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
te	Neut	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Neut	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
te	Neut	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."
te	Neut	It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .
te	Neut	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Neut	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Neut	We ' ve got a Steven , the one word that didn ' t crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .
te	Neut	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Neut	But because we don ' t want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone ' s a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it ' s ever been .
te	Neut	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Neut	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Neut	It is a setback for the war on terror .
te	Neut	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Neut	Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .
te	Neut	The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday .
te	Neut	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Neut	This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .
te	Neut	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .
te	Neut	As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .
te	Neut	It should be easily googled .
te	Neut	probablyl gonna just kick it
te	Neut	I don ' t know how much it will help however .
te	Neut	Richard Harper and Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you ' ve already gone through it with them .
te	Neut	When you discussed it , i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult .
te	Neut	is it for guitar ?
te	Neut	Well , wouldn ' t you know it .
te	Neut	However , do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season .
te	Neut	"The sample includes our "" caveat "", so it should be fine ."
te	Neut	I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a general feel of your end of the process .
te	Neut	But let me know if I can spend a day , morning , or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good time .
te	Neut	I think it will help me very much in my role .
te	Neut	I need a new lawnmower , so I ' ll try to bump it up a little more .
te	Neut	WE AT HOME LOVE IT AT $ 80 +++
te	Neut	it is to late for me to add changes .
te	Neut	And that ' s the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down .
te	Neut	Opinions , conclusions and other information in this message that do not relate to the official business of my firm shall be understood as neither given nor endorsed by it .
te	Neut	that deal is making like it wants to close and the traders scheduled a 430 call to wrap it up
te	Neut	The design of the model and its potential economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be .
te	Neut	I wish I could make it .
te	Neut	could you also CC me the first few times you send it ?
te	Neut	After friday , I will no longer have access to the estate , so if you could shoot this off over night so I could have something in the morning to work with I would appreciate it .
te	Neut	its good .
te	Neut	u must read it .
te	Neut	Its awesome - better than book 5
te	Neut	I just finish reading a really good book ( it was actually a ebook ) from some new series called the The Tale of Terra .
te	Neut	The story had brillant battle scenes , lovable heroes and villians , a compelling story line , and it left me dying for the next part of the series :) go to taleofterra . com to learn more aboout it
te	Neut	WE HAVE A DATE FOR THE RELEASE OF RAGNAROK ONLINE 2 ( beta anyway ) September 16 - 18 , this was announced by Gravity CEO Kim Jung - Ryool on either 16th or 17th of july and as i don ' t want to take someone ' s credit ' s i got it here ^^ GameSpot
te	Neut	I like the way Otto Jespersen ( in ' Language : Its Nature , Development and Origin ') aptly summarised the nature of language changes by comparing it with one of the theories of the Manchester School of Economics :
te	Neut	So be sure to get your pet ' s memorial on the site and if you have a charity / rescue , make sure it is listed on their database so you can receive some of the profits from the site .
te	Neut	Alteration of the Mississippi River and the destruction of wetlands at its mouth have left the area around New Orleans abnormally vulnerable to the forces of nature .
te	Neut	n3td3v saw this story on BBC News Online and thought you should see it .
te	Neut	Web giant Google is resisting an attempt by the US to force it to reveal what users are searching for .
te	Neut	So I started a small mailing list and added their addresses to it .
te	Neut	Dogs , cats , rabbits , wolves , moose , horses , you name it , we have it .
te	Neut	Wiki Media Foundation , the group behind the Wikipedia online encyclopedia project , said Friday that search giant Google has volunteered to host some of its content on company servers .
te	Neut	It looks like the war between Microsoft and Google is quickly brewing on the horizon .
te	Neut	Google is probably making this move to counter Microsoft Search using Encarta ( it ' s online dictionary ).
te	Neut	But it looks like Google isn ' t opening it ' s mouth about the reason behind the offer as Linux News reports :
te	Neut	""" While we don ' t have anything specific to announce today , Google and the Wikimedia Foundation are collaboratively evaluating creative ways to support Wikipedia . org and its community ."""
te	Neut	Sure Google , although this would put it on coarse for global domination of the internet by 2014 .
te	Neut	It will be interesting to see whether or not Google will finally slay the Microsoft Goliath , who has known no major defeat and seeks to vanquish all competition .
te	Neut	I ' m getting in touch because I think it could be useful to people campaigning about hospital closures .
te	Neut	It would be great if the person from CHANT who started this page would put up a short description of the campaign and a list to this group page on the Action Network site .
te	Neut	""" Well ,"" says the boy , "" because it wouldn ' t be an accident , and it certainly wouldn ' t be a great loss !"""
te	Neut	"It looks like The Lunar Transportation Systems , Inc . is visualizing a "" space highway "" going from the moon to Earth ( and back again )."
te	Neut	""" We are so excited that the White House and the recent new government space policy underscores the need to involve the private sector in assisting NASA develop its plans for the new Vision for Space Exploration ,"" said Walter Kistler , LTS co - founder and Chairman ."
te	Neut	"With their proposal of a "" Earth - Moon "" highway , it looks like space tourism may become a reality sooner than we think ."
te	Neut	It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved .
te	Neut	Although these new rockets are probably more expensive , they will be able to go at a much greater range than it ' s shuttle cousins , as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well .
te	Neut	The new rocket design will differ slightly from it ' s predecessors , in the fact that the crew and cargo would launch separately from two different rockets each and join up in space later on .
te	Neut	We could certainly slow the aging process down if it had to work its way through Congress .
te	Neut	Money can ' t buy you happiness ... but it does bring you a more pleasant form of misery .
te	Neut	Youth would be an ideal state if it came a little later in life .
te	Neut	Then it ' s time for my nap .
te	Neut	Don ' t worry about avoiding temptation ... as you grow older , it will avoid you .
te	Neut	Maybe it ' s true that life begins at fifty ... but everything else starts to wear out , fall out , or spread out .
te	Neut	It is a place in Argentina lol
te	Neut	how much does it cost to join world resorts international ?
te	Neut	How much does it cost to buy a Big Mac meal in your area ?
te	Neut	Here in Indiana I think it ' s like $ 3 or $ 4 for a meal .
te	Neut	Typically it ' s cold .
te	Neut	jay is it necessary to varnish my oil paintings or just leave them be ?
te	Neut	Can police trace a cell phone even if it is switched off ?
te	Neut	Can police trace a cell phone even if it is switched off ?
te	Neut	Yeah you gotta burn it .. thats the only way
te	Neut	It ' s okay if it ' s a little pricier .
te	Neut	if i preorder a game at gamestop can someone else pick it up for me ?
te	Neut	i put $ 5 bucks down for it too .
te	Neut	Was wondering if anyone knew a rough estimate of how much it costs with travel and training
te	Neut	also i was wondering , is it true that the bigger the speakers are the better .
te	Neut	its a gift from my brother .
te	Neut	why will hav to pay customs if it is a gift ...??
te	Neut	But my resturant is way better than all of them ... and it ' s quite close .
te	Neut	It ' s just up the highway and right around the corner ....
te	Neut	In our hand luggage or do we have to put it into our checked luggage ?
te	Neut	I don ' t think it matters
te	Neut	Yes you can carry your duty free bottles , and liquids onto your connection as it is only a domestic flight :-)
te	Neut	Google the term or find photography supplies websites and put it in the search box ( or look for studio equipment supplies ).
te	Neut	Of THESE three , it ' s a toss - up between Royal and Carnival .
te	Neut	MAD means crazy , or angry , so you do a lot with it , i would put a gorrilla screaming , just the face , and just throw in a lot of brushes fifferent colors , make it look artistic .
te	Neut	can anyone tell me exactly what it is and what took place ?
te	Neut	I cant find any information about it
te	Neut	However , it certainly wouldn ' t hurt if you wanted to provide one .
te	Neut	How much would it cost for me to take me and three friends to Andiamos restaurant for dinner ?
te	Neut	I really want to go to andiamos for my birthday and i was just wondering how much it would cost for the four of us to eat there
te	Neut	Have no idea what kind of restaurant this is or where it is .
te	Neut	its cheap and its good !
te	Neut	prime ribs have very good food but its super expensive
te	Neut	It actually needs to be relatively waterproof - the last one I bought had me soaked in anything more than light / moderate rain .
te	Neut	I ' ll pay up to 200 - 250 for it if I have to .
te	Neut	I have a Kodak Camera ( 10 . 2 Megapixels )... Kodak AF 5x OPTICAL LENS ... how do I pause it while recording ?
te	Neut	I have a Kodak Camera ( 10 . 2 Megapixels )... Kodak AF 5x OPTICAL LENS ... how do I pause it while recording ?
te	Neut	That ' s because of the buffer that holds the data until it ' s ready to be recorded to the memory card .
te	Neut	I know its in the wrong catagory , but still , I wrote this question for a reason , not for you to critisize me .
te	Neut	Any of the tip - top places have great ice - cream , get them to mix it up .
te	Neut	any Ice Cream In NZ no matter where as New Zealand has the best bl ** dy ice cream in the world I was in NZ for a few weeks had some Ice Cream and really enjoyed it I will go back just to eat some Ice Cream
te	Neut	What could it be ?
te	Neut	esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY !!!
te	Neut	I think it was in the Lincoln Square area but don ' t quote me on that .
te	Neut	It ' s ' gimmick ' was that you fill your bowl cafeteria - style from raw ingredients and leave it on the counter with a chopstick listing your table number on it .
te	Neut	Four guys around a large square open hibachi cook your food , and when it ' s finished a server brings it to your table .
te	Neut	It was pretty epic as I remember and would love to send my friend there .
te	Neut	But since in my country it lasts for minimum 6 years , and I want to go aground the world , what do you think , should I do it before or after medical school ?
te	Neut	I would much rather put it off until I can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as I ' m sure this trip is intended to be .
te	Neut	the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in .
te	Neut	is it worthy to send in for warranty repair ?
te	Neut	Your camera isn ' t acting normally , you got warranty , let Canon deal with it .
te	Neut	I also agree it ' s under warranty so get in touch with Canon .
te	Neut	It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re - boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re - start from time to time but it shouldn ' t be happening in a camera .
te	Neut	Looking for something on the casual side and we want it to be fun .
te	Neut	to make convo , it ' s short , so if things go great , you can
te	Neut	extend , and if you want to end it , you just say bye ,
te	Neut	I decided to get a 150 gal aquarium , what can I fill it with ?
te	Neut	Here is the stocking for my 150 gallon tank i upgraded it to 200 at the weekend because of the clownloach A 200 gallon with 6 pairs of Breeding Angel fish fire mouth honey Gouramis 5 8 inch clownloach a Krib and 5 1 inch clown loach with 16 cory cats 5 Australian Rainbows
te	Neut	If you took out the clown loach it would make a nice 150 gallon tank .
te	Neut	fill it with water :) lol
te	Neut	It ' s well cool . :)
te	Neut	It taste better than In and Out ....
te	Neut	Good local steakhouse , I recommend it !
te	Neut	it was a little to high dollar for me
te	Neut	it is a cute little nice and quiet library
te	Neut	It ' s impossible to understand how this place has survived .
te	Neut	Listened to my problem and took care of it .
te	Neut	Make sure to put OILY sauces on your food to make it moist !
te	Neut	I just called this number and it is a Ralph ' s Market .
te	Neut	Keep it up .
te	Neut	I had to get a permit here , it was cool
te	Neut	service could be a little better but its an all round good place
te	Neut	But the servers don ' t pay attention to you whether it ' s busy or not .
te	Neut	Sheer contrast to getting it done at karol bagh which is done under the wooden plank
te	Neut	It ' s a fine place , I ' m just a little mystified about the Michelin star .
te	Neut	Nothing wrong with it , just better options at this price point .
te	Neut	The restaurant is the most beautiful thai restaurant in Geelong ... just love it
te	Neut	Fried rice has NO flavor , it literally taste like water .
te	Neut	When I tried to return it they refused , so I had to leave without a refund and still hungry .
te	Neut	The waiting staff is really friendly , its like every one knows each other , the manager is really sweet and the food .. well no complaints from me .
te	Neut	Yes , its that good .
te	Neut	This place had the worst tasting pizza I have ever tasted it was possible the worst food I ' ve ever eaten .
te	Neut	Bisconti wanted over $ 300 to fix my laptop and these guys fixed it for $ 90 !
te	Neut	Had it fixed within a few days ( had to order a part ).
te	Neut	It ' s a nice , relaxed place to get stuff done and relax .
te	Neut	I was with verizon and I checked my service with tmobile and it was great so I thought I would try tmobile .
te	Neut	It turned out being very good quality tmobile service and I was happy with the new tmobile phone .
te	Neut	I ' ve been a regular customer at this store since it opened , and love the fact that all of the employees are friendly locals .
te	Neut	The door is easy to use and it keeps the cold out during the winter .
te	Neut	It can be a little on the spicy side but just ask them exactly what you want and they are very helpful .
te	Neut	Unfortunately , I ' ve given it a couple of tries at different times and decided to stop going .
te	Neut	The employees don ' t really seem to enjoy what they are doing and it shows .
te	Neut	It was late in the day and I was worried I would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever .
te	Neut	Don ' t judge a book by its cover
te	Neut	From the outside Ichiban looks like it will be terrible .
te	Neut	It was all sorted with no hassle at all and I ' m really grateful - they were fab .
te	Neut	After they showed up there was a little trouble to get my car unlocked , it took quite a bit of time but the job was well done .
te	Neut	Strip mall asian it is not !
te	Neut	yet again it was a great stay from begiinning to end .
te	Neut	Believe it or not , but the channel guide has been most helpful to my family members that visit and don ' t know where to start when it comes to watching satellite tv .
te	Neut	We tried 4 different style of donuts , they were all the same when it came to quality .
te	Masc	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Masc	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Masc	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn ' t even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
te	Masc	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
te	Masc	He has denied this .
te	Masc	We don ' t have to believe him .
te	Masc	Important news such as President Bush ' s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti - gay ( update : he ' s not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
te	Masc	Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
te	Masc	Which essentially sounds like he ' s worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
te	Masc	I assume his actual reason is that he ' s worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can ' t grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
te	Masc	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).

te	Masc	Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .

te	Masc	"The question is , "" Should he have known it was coming ?"""
te	Masc	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
te	Masc	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Masc	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .
te	Masc	Bush did not have his eye on the ball .
te	Masc	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Masc	Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
te	Masc	"Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet ' s hair was "" on fire "" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists ."

te	Masc	Seriously , I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $ 53 , 000 .

te	Masc	The goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well .
te	Masc	I agree with Steve ' s position stated in his separate e ' mail .

te	Masc	I talked with Gary Wilson , and he confirmed that the revised values are correct .
te	Masc	He looked like a great guy for your group .
te	Masc	I have spoken with Mark Lay and he is interested .
te	Masc	Even if we cannot help you here in Enron , he may be able to put you in touch with other CV groups in town .
te	Masc	Please , call him directly and give my name as a reference .

te	Masc	"One little boy stands up and offersthat , "" if my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street when a car came along and killed him , that would be a tragedy ""."
te	Masc	Finally , a boy in the back raises his hand .
te	Masc	"In a timid voice , he says : "" If an airplane carrying Winston Peters was blown up by a bomb , THAT would be a tragedy ""."
te	Masc	I have never hated a man enough to give his diamonds back .
te	Masc	By the time a man is wise enough to watch his step , he ' s too old to go anywhere .

te	Masc	He needs a shower , and he picks his nose all the time .
te	Masc	He is at his best when he is doing his Nerd impression ...

te	Masc	Michelangelo made the marble one but why did he do another if Donatello had already made one ?
te	Masc	Because he liked making statues of David ! : D
te	Masc	Obviously , he should have been arrested and jailed - imagine making a statue or painting on the same subject as another artist - clearly insulting and disrespecting - wasted time that could have been used making a statue with clothes on .

te	Masc	and hopefully you do not know the same people because he tells others about you payment status .
te	Masc	He seemed to understand how important it was for us to make sure the whole house was sprayed so he took his time .
te	Masc	We went through six photographers to find the right photographers that would represent our firm in the light we wished to and Michael and his team made that happen .
te	Masc	He ' s worth every penny .
