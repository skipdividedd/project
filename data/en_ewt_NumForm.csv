tr	Digit	DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad .
tr	Digit	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J . Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s .
tr	Digit	The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings .
tr	Digit	Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers .
tr	Digit	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Digit	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Digit	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Digit	Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
tr	Digit	The trial begins again Nov . 28 .
tr	Digit	Over 300 Iraqis are reported dead and 500 wounded in Fallujah alone .
tr	Digit	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
tr	Digit	Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
tr	Digit	However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
tr	Digit	The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
tr	Digit	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
tr	Digit	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Digit	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Digit	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .
tr	Digit	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Digit	Let ' s just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :

tr	Digit	The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
tr	Digit	Hiller asked , inquiring about Gen . Pervaiz Musharraf , who seized control of the country October 12 .
tr	Digit	""" Wait , wait , is this 50 questions ?"" asked Bush ."
tr	Digit	Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year .
tr	Digit	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .

tr	Digit	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
tr	Digit	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Digit	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Digit	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Digit	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .

tr	Digit	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U . S . State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .

tr	Digit	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Digit	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Digit	The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
tr	Digit	During this time , F - 102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand .
tr	Digit	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
tr	Digit	That was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training periods thrown in as well .
tr	Digit	After training , Bush kept flying , racking up hundreds of hours in F - 102 jets .
tr	Digit	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Digit	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Digit	Bush earned 340 points in 1969 - 1970 .
tr	Digit	He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
tr	Digit	And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
tr	Digit	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti - Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ).
tr	Digit	Requests like that weren ’ t unusual , says retired Col . William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
tr	Digit	“ In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots ,” Campenni says .
tr	Digit	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Digit	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Digit	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Digit	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Digit	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Digit	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Digit	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer .”
tr	Digit	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .

tr	Digit	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Digit	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Digit	Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
tr	Digit	But Posada ' s nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that ' s a vain hope .
tr	Digit	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross - examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .

tr	Digit	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."

tr	Digit	In early February , India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ).
tr	Digit	Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , which took a heavy toll on the Andamans .
tr	Digit	The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base .

tr	Digit	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Digit	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Digit	That changed on September 22 when President George W . Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
tr	Digit	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .

tr	Digit	Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi - national corporation , April , 2004 :
tr	Digit	My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
tr	Digit	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Digit	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
tr	Digit	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Digit	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Digit	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Digit	And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
tr	Digit	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Digit	September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
tr	Digit	The United States understands this now , after September 11 .

tr	Digit	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Digit	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Digit	"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ("" CIA "") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax ."
tr	Digit	"An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "" unbelievable "" biological attack , the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("" KSM "")."
tr	Digit	In November 2003 , a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties .
tr	Digit	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Digit	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Digit	Many people have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the mailings served as a threat and warning .
tr	Digit	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Digit	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
tr	Digit	Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 , included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise .
tr	Digit	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Digit	Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9 / 11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
tr	Digit	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Digit	"In March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9 / 11 but was to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Digit	Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $ 14 , 000 in July , accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks .
tr	Digit	Al Qaeda ' s regional operative , Hambali , who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat , has been captured .
tr	Digit	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Digit	Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
tr	Digit	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Digit	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Digit	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Digit	"A few days before Christmas 2003 , after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks , to include in the US homeland , the threat level was raised to orange or "" high ."""
tr	Digit	Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9 / 11 on US soil .
tr	Digit	"In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop ( from 1995 ) that was signed "" Khalid Sheik Bojinka ""?"
tr	Digit	In May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9 / 11 Commission .
tr	Digit	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Digit	Zawahiri , Al Qaeda ' s # 2 , is head of Al Qaeda ' s biochemical program .
tr	Digit	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Digit	A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
tr	Digit	There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 .
tr	Digit	Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources .
tr	Digit	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Digit	( Spores must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable .)
tr	Digit	US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9 / 11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 .
tr	Digit	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Digit	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Digit	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Digit	As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino .
tr	Digit	Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
tr	Digit	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Digit	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Digit	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Digit	In early June 2003 , a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax .
tr	Digit	Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam ' s son .
tr	Digit	The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq ' s secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
tr	Digit	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Digit	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Digit	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Digit	The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D . C ..
tr	Digit	Abdel Rahman ' s son was captured in Quetta , Pakistan in mid - February 2003 .
tr	Digit	That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 .
tr	Digit	The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM ' s nephew .
tr	Digit	A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
tr	Digit	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Digit	"Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "" The 19 Martyrs ."""
tr	Digit	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Digit	Zawahiri ' s mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes .
tr	Digit	Second , hindsight is 20 / 20 .
tr	Digit	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
tr	Digit	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
tr	Digit	The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .

tr	Digit	Confidential Settlement Document Per CPUC Rule 51
tr	Digit	As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
tr	Digit	* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *
tr	Digit	* Offers a 7 . 5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
tr	Digit	* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3 . 5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
tr	Digit	PG & E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today ' s mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
tr	Digit	This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG & E ' s headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
tr	Digit	"Finally , please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in "" Word 2000 "" format ."
tr	Digit	We look forward to seeing you on January 10 - 11 .

tr	Digit	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California ' s energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices .
tr	Digit	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Digit	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct . 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .
tr	Digit	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .
tr	Digit	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Digit	Records show that on Oct . 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .
tr	Digit	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Digit	What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .
tr	Digit	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Digit	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Digit	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO records show .
tr	Digit	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Digit	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .

tr	Digit	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Digit	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Digit	Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
tr	Digit	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Digit	You don ' t want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
tr	Digit	My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
tr	Digit	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .

tr	Digit	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Digit	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Digit	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .

tr	Digit	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Digit	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Digit	"Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "" light ,"" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
tr	Digit	UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .
tr	Digit	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Digit	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Digit	I tamed them in 4 days .
tr	Digit	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .

tr	Digit	Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
tr	Digit	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Digit	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Digit	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Digit	We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
tr	Digit	I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish .
tr	Digit	1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long .
tr	Digit	2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5cm long .
tr	Digit	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Digit	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Digit	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Digit	Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .
tr	Digit	With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
tr	Digit	Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5 . 8 to 10 . 6 DH should be fine for gardneri .
tr	Digit	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Digit	I will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds .

tr	Digit	My wife and I , in our 60 ' s at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
tr	Digit	He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
tr	Digit	He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
tr	Digit	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Digit	I ' ve known the guy for about 10 years .

tr	Digit	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Digit	Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
tr	Digit	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Digit	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Digit	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Digit	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
tr	Digit	He ' s dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days .
tr	Digit	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Digit	We ' ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .

tr	Digit	I adopted a 3 . 5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
tr	Digit	And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
tr	Digit	Boutique stores dealing in children ' s clothing / gifts are often outrageously priced ( who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie ?)
tr	Digit	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Digit	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Digit	I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
tr	Digit	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Digit	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
tr	Digit	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Digit	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
tr	Digit	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Digit	I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
tr	Digit	In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I ' m already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
tr	Digit	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
tr	Digit	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Digit	I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK .
tr	Digit	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Digit	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
tr	Digit	I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
tr	Digit	I rated it 5 stars .
tr	Digit	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Digit	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Digit	I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
tr	Digit	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Digit	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Digit	That was 4 years ago .
tr	Digit	( I ' ve been through at least 5 places already .)
tr	Digit	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Digit	"I brought a car in to have the "" check engine "" light diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
tr	Digit	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Digit	Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ).
tr	Digit	I did the work myself for $ 50 .
tr	Digit	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Digit	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Digit	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Digit	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Digit	The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
tr	Digit	$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
tr	Digit	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Digit	I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
tr	Digit	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
tr	Digit	While there wasn ' t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
tr	Digit	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Digit	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Digit	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Digit	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Digit	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
tr	Digit	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Digit	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
tr	Digit	The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
tr	Digit	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
tr	Digit	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Digit	I have had my back fused in 2 places .
tr	Digit	I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
tr	Digit	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Digit	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Digit	And students get $ 5 off , can ' t argue with that .
tr	Digit	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
tr	Digit	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Digit	Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
tr	Digit	For the quality , the prices ($ 4 -$ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
tr	Digit	me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
tr	Digit	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Digit	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Digit	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Digit	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
tr	Digit	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Digit	Cons : * Server wasn ' t very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
tr	Digit	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Digit	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Digit	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Digit	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Digit	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Digit	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Digit	Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ($ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
tr	Digit	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Digit	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
tr	Digit	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
tr	Digit	Don ' t go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
tr	Digit	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
tr	Digit	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Digit	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Digit	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
tr	Digit	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Digit	After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
tr	Digit	Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
tr	Digit	Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day ' s training
tr	Digit	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Digit	A & E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
tr	Digit	The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A & E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A & E does not ).
tr	Digit	If the pedicure lasted 20 mins ., that was a stretch .
tr	Digit	I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
tr	Digit	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Digit	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9 : 30am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
tr	Digit	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Digit	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
tr	Digit	I brought it back with 9000 miles .
tr	Digit	Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
tr	Digit	We signed our name in about 6 : 00pm .
tr	Digit	There were 3 names before us .
tr	Digit	The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
tr	Digit	However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
tr	Digit	"January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday ' s 2 PM class "" Beginning Yoga with Brittany ."""
tr	Digit	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Digit	We waited until 2 : 25 PM and then left .
tr	Digit	There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
tr	Digit	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Digit	I ' m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
tr	Digit	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
tr	Digit	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Digit	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Digit	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
tr	Digit	Then I got a bill for $ 483 . 00 .
tr	Digit	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160 . 00 has come through .
tr	Digit	I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
tr	Digit	Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
tr	Digit	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Digit	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Digit	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
tr	Digit	With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chilis , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
tr	Digit	VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
tr	Digit	The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
tr	Digit	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who ' d arrived around 1 : 00 am and were drinking at the springs .
tr	Digit	FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
tr	Digit	For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
tr	Digit	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Digit	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Digit	Prices are reasonable , ( Kids meals are around 4 . 99 ) and Wednesday ' s they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
tr	Digit	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Digit	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Digit	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
tr	Digit	I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
tr	Digit	The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !

tr	Digit	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
tr	Digit	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Digit	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Digit	Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
tr	Digit	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Digit	I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
tr	Digit	So from $ 55 to $ 260 ?
tr	Digit	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Digit	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Digit	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Digit	I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
tr	Digit	At 3 : 15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
tr	Digit	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Digit	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Digit	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Digit	When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
tr	Digit	And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture .
tr	Digit	So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started .
tr	Digit	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Digit	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Digit	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Digit	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Digit	However , after giving a required $ 500 . 00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
tr	Digit	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Digit	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
tr	Digit	Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
tr	Digit	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
tr	Digit	I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
tr	Digit	I emailed 4 times , never a response .
tr	Digit	We visited on 7 / 26 / 08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia ' s on Greenfield Ave .
tr	Digit	I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
tr	Digit	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Digit	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Digit	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Digit	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
tr	Digit	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Digit	My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100 , 000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
tr	Digit	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Digit	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
tr	Digit	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
tr	Digit	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Digit	I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
tr	Digit	That ' s all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
tr	Digit	Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
tr	Digit	I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
tr	Digit	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Digit	Not only did they answer the phone at 4 : 50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
tr	Digit	They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6 : 30 that evening .
tr	Digit	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Digit	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
tr	Digit	THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
tr	Digit	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Digit	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Digit	Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
tr	Digit	May , 2009 .
tr	Digit	Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1 : 00 am !
tr	Digit	There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
tr	Digit	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Digit	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Digit	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Digit	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Digit	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
tr	Digit	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order .
tr	Digit	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Digit	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Digit	Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
tr	Digit	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Digit	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Digit	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Digit	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Digit	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Digit	There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
tr	Digit	$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
tr	Digit	However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6 , 000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
tr	Digit	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Digit	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Digit	On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
tr	Digit	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Digit	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Digit	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
tr	Digit	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Digit	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Digit	I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
tr	Digit	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Digit	"He later said that by 2 months he "" meant at least two months ""."
tr	Digit	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Digit	So I say : I ' m at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
tr	Digit	OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
tr	Digit	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Digit	Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
tr	Digit	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Digit	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Digit	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Digit	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Digit	They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
tr	Digit	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M , no exceptions .
tr	Digit	We returned after 3PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
tr	Digit	If they think you ' ve taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1 . 50 per can .
tr	Digit	# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
tr	Digit	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Digit	# 4 ) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM .
tr	Digit	I ' d go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I wouldn ' t pay their rack rate .
tr	Digit	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Digit	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Digit	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Digit	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Digit	Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
tr	Digit	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Digit	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Digit	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Digit	Of course I couldn ' t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ).
tr	Digit	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Word	Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior !
tr	Word	In Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated .
tr	Word	Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half .
tr	Word	One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
tr	Word	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Word	My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non - stop .
tr	Word	Elena ' s motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
tr	Word	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
tr	Word	CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT : TEN YEARS ON
tr	Word	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post - accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
tr	Word	One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
tr	Word	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Word	"Texas Gov . George W . Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those names ."
tr	Word	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Word	So , one answer to Bush ' s charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
tr	Word	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Word	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Word	And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s four - day visit to India recently .
tr	Word	According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
tr	Word	""" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one ."
tr	Word	Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
tr	Word	Kumaratunga ' s India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .
tr	Word	Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US $ 4 . 5 billion .
tr	Word	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Word	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Word	Two years ago , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements .
tr	Word	India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China ( which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
tr	Word	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Word	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Word	"Under President Hu Jintao , Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year , making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U . N . Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "" permanent five "" that has not yet done so ."
tr	Word	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Word	News coverage of the president ’ s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
tr	Word	Six weeks of basic training .
tr	Word	Fifty - three weeks of flight training .
tr	Word	Twenty - one weeks of fighter - interceptor training .
tr	Word	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Word	Not two years of weekends .
tr	Word	Two years .
tr	Word	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Word	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Word	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Word	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Word	One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
tr	Word	Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi ' s Al - Iraqiya list .
tr	Word	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' gifts ' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi , a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis .
tr	Word	Indeed , Sistani ' s agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
tr	Word	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Word	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
tr	Word	Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
tr	Word	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
tr	Word	Even partition is not a possibility , there are no clear borders between the two .
tr	Word	"The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson did not work "" directly or indirectly "" for the CIA since retiring ."
tr	Word	Last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , threw out Wilson ' s two - decades old conviction .

tr	Word	Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People ' s Front .
tr	Word	Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
tr	Word	All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan .
tr	Word	That temper is only one problem .
tr	Word	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Word	"There is one place in Alabama where Mr . Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Word	Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr . Bush was not one of them .
tr	Word	GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of ' 72 , Red Blount ' s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr . Bush ' s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
tr	Word	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
tr	Word	But the four planeloads of arms have vanished .
tr	Word	This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re - routed to al - Qaeda .
tr	Word	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Word	An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
tr	Word	"After the sentencing one of Robinson ' s tearful supporters "" turned to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [ SNAP ], who had helped reopen the case , and told her , ' I hope you rot in hell !'"""
tr	Word	"Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI ' s list of "" Ten Most Wanted Fugitives ,"" a move that caps law enforcement ' s dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ...[ because of ] the impact that the group ' s practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women ."

tr	Word	Two young men delivering information about the Mormon genealogy program .
tr	Word	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
tr	Word	I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US ' s local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
tr	Word	The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Word	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Word	The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
tr	Word	The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
tr	Word	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Word	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
tr	Word	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
tr	Word	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Word	"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam ' s regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration ""."
tr	Word	Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
tr	Word	Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
tr	Word	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Word	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Word	Do you shoot an arch - murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
tr	Word	Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
tr	Word	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Word	Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
tr	Word	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Word	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Word	"According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda ’ s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face ."""
tr	Word	But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri ' s decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter .
tr	Word	At one time , some thought he had been spotted in Iran .
tr	Word	The CIA has known of Zawahiri ' s plans to use anthrax for a half decade .
tr	Word	Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns .
tr	Word	Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
tr	Word	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Word	"The "" trillion spore "" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
tr	Word	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Word	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Word	Two top Iraqi scientists , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi ' s anthrax program , according to Dr . David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
tr	Word	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Word	A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the conclusion that there were not one , but two , such mailings containing anthrax .
tr	Word	( The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun ).

tr	Word	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .
tr	Word	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .

tr	Word	The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
tr	Word	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."

tr	Word	At least one expert believes China ' s intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA ' s planned lunar return .
tr	Word	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .

tr	Word	""" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change ,"" said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world ' s leading experts on this issue ."

tr	Word	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Word	I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
tr	Word	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Word	Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
tr	Word	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
tr	Word	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Word	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Word	( For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me !)
tr	Word	One of the worst places
tr	Word	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Word	However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
tr	Word	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Word	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Word	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Word	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Word	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Word	One night was too much .
tr	Word	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Word	Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
tr	Word	Their quote came in at half the price of A & E for the same work and same part .
tr	Word	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
tr	Word	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
tr	Word	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Word	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Word	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Word	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Word	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
tr	Word	Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks .
tr	Word	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Word	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
tr	Word	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Word	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Word	For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
tr	Word	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Word	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Word	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
tr	Word	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Word	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Word	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Word	One more thing , they don ' t take any credit cards or checks .
tr	Word	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Word	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet ' s that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
tr	Word	NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD .
tr	Word	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
tr	Word	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Word	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
tr	Word	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Word	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Word	First of all , if you call for an appointment they won ' t tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
tr	Word	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Word	I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
tr	Word	Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
tr	Word	My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind !).
tr	Word	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Word	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
tr	Word	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Word	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
tr	Word	One of the worst experiences I ' ve ever had with a auto repair shop .
tr	Word	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Word	Well , that was strike one .
tr	Word	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
tr	Word	Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
tr	Word	My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
tr	Word	After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces .
tr	Word	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Word	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Word	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Word	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Word	Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
tr	Word	I ' d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they don ' t just take every dog coming in .
tr	Word	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Word	17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
tr	Word	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
tr	Word	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Word	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Word	I WAS calling about one board !!
tr	Word	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Word	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
tr	Word	Don ' t get the rooms off the two kitchens .
tr	Word	Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ).
tr	Word	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Word	OK , one bad experience ... fine .
tr	Word	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Word	Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
tr	Roman	( if .....) ( iii ) definitive agreements acceptable to Party A in its sole discretion regarding the debt and all other aspects of [ the project to be owned by Party B ], including but not limited to the senior debt facility , commitments and all project documents , have been fully negotiated and executed and the [ project ] has been brought to financial close .
tr	Roman	Gas Accord II Settlement Participants :
tr	Roman	Attached is PG & E ' s Gas Accord II ( GA II ) Settlement Proposal .
tr	Roman	* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ). *
tr	Roman	The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal , an Attachment ( a copy of PG & E ' s proposed Gas Rule 27 ), and a set of supporting workpapers .
tr	Roman	<< PG & E Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal 12 - 20 - 00 . doc >> << Proposed Gas Rule 27 . doc >> << COS & Rates Workpapers for GA II 12 - 20 - 2000 Proposal . xls >>
tr	Roman	Also , add a semicolon at the end of clause ( i ).
tr	Roman	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Roman	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .
va	Word	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .
va	Word	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Word	""" Arafat ' s secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky ."
va	Word	US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead .

va	Word	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Word	But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal .
va	Word	At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
va	Word	This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn ' t anticipated .
va	Word	But if -- there ' s a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
va	Word	Four months later , we were married .

va	Word	This is one thought - provoking film .
va	Word	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Word	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr ' s movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
va	Word	One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
va	Word	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
va	Word	i knew someone in college who had one and i loved it .

va	Word	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Word	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
va	Word	One thing is certain for sure .
va	Word	Give it three days barring Sundays and holidays .
va	Word	Out of the 650k est stolen works of art by the Nazis ... 70k still remain missing .. and there are thousands in musems that haven ' t been returned to their right full owners and heirs ..

va	Digit	Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
va	Digit	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
va	Digit	And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
