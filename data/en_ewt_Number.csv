tr	Sing	Al - Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border .
tr	Sing	[ This killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come .]
tr	Sing	DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad .
tr	Sing	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J . Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s .
tr	Sing	The third was being run by the head of an investment firm .
tr	Sing	You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets .
tr	Sing	Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don ' t find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful .
tr	Sing	It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
tr	Sing	Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul .
tr	Sing	The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings .
tr	Sing	On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home .
tr	Sing	In Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated .
tr	Sing	( Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population , who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in .
tr	Sing	This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center - north of the country .)
tr	Sing	In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district .
tr	Sing	His mother was also killed in the attack .
tr	Sing	One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
tr	Sing	( This is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination ; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec . 15 elections .)
tr	Sing	Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec . 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
tr	Sing	The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion .
tr	Sing	This item is a small one and easily missed .
tr	Sing	But in my view it is highly significant .
tr	Sing	The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas .
tr	Sing	Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran .
tr	Sing	He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and won ' t have many seats in the new parliament .
tr	Sing	Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership .
tr	Sing	The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way .
tr	Sing	If someone committed a crime against humanity , prosecute the person .
tr	Sing	If he or she did not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
tr	Sing	Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
tr	Sing	A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died .
tr	Sing	The trial begins again Nov . 28 .
tr	Sing	In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya .
tr	Sing	There has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again .
tr	Sing	My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non - stop .
tr	Sing	Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars , they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area , then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK - 47 ' s in the air .
tr	Sing	And there is nothing we can do about it really , people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land .
tr	Sing	Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood , and those are trained and armed , so don ' t expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn ' t bomb them , and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen ?
tr	Sing	Everyone is apprehensive , there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days .
tr	Sing	What irritates me is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi ' ite clerics , we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance , and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as ' Ba ' athists ', ' Saddamites ', ' Wahhabis ', and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago .
tr	Sing	So what happened ?
tr	Sing	I guess it ' s just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ', or ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again .
tr	Sing	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that is okay for Al - Jazeera .
tr	Sing	Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents .
tr	Sing	Al - Iraqiyah tv said that ICDC were controlling Ramadi .
tr	Sing	"Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ', in which he stated that "" although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions ""."
tr	Sing	"He added that "" America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see "", and that "" the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters ""."
tr	Sing	Elena ' s motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
tr	Sing	UPDATE :
tr	Sing	Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story .
tr	Sing	This is not a post about fault - finding or assigning blame .
tr	Sing	It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
tr	Sing	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
tr	Sing	This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following :
tr	Sing	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
tr	Sing	CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT : TEN YEARS ON
tr	Sing	In the last decade , there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise .
tr	Sing	The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .
tr	Sing	However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
tr	Sing	The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
tr	Sing	... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in women ' s reproductive health , an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ....
tr	Sing	As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
tr	Sing	There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl .
tr	Sing	Being well - informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
tr	Sing	IAEA Report Lessons learned
tr	Sing	I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing .
tr	Sing	radiation :
tr	Sing	As a child in the 50 ' s I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best !) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
tr	Sing	That too was stopped .
tr	Sing	Don ' t have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks -- there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl .......
tr	Sing	The Chernobyl Children ' s Project ( http :// www . adiccp . org / home / default . asp ) offers several ways to help the children of that region .
tr	Sing	One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
tr	Sing	Even a little time spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc . can add years to their lives .
tr	Sing	The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming , and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have .
tr	Sing	Take care , my friend , Linda
tr	Sing	I ' m sorry to say Elena ' s story has been revealed to be a fake .
tr	Sing	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
tr	Sing	The tape was a way to signal priorities .
tr	Sing	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
tr	Sing	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .
tr	Sing	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .
tr	Sing	MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelters Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .
tr	Sing	If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts .
tr	Sing	All this is highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot schemes .
tr	Sing	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .
tr	Sing	"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship ."
tr	Sing	On the other hand , the US should strong - arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue .
tr	Sing	Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf ' s lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
tr	Sing	The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism , and even the threat of nuclear war , than Iraq ever did .
tr	Sing	2 ) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government .
tr	Sing	Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .
tr	Sing	This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks .
tr	Sing	It should continue to be defanged .
tr	Sing	But Sharon ' s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .
tr	Sing	Sharon ' s hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas ' s terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .
tr	Sing	Israel owes the United States at least this much , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace .
tr	Sing	3 ) Make Iraq another Afghanistan , using the Republican Right ' s own tactics against them .
tr	Sing	Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there .
tr	Sing	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .
tr	Sing	The problem of mollifying the Sunnis , though , has to be solved to avoid giving al - Qaeda an entrée .
tr	Sing	Of course , the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less - provocative local or international forces , the better .
tr	Sing	Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn ' t nearly as good a rallying cry for al - Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out .
tr	Sing	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one ' s eyes off the former ball .
tr	Sing	George W . Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .
tr	Sing	The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
tr	Sing	' Bush fails reporter ' s pop quiz on international leaders
tr	Sing	November 5 , 1999
tr	Sing	Web posted at : 3 : 29 p . m . EST ( 2029 GMT )
tr	Sing	WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
tr	Sing	"Texas Gov . George W . Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those names ."
tr	Sing	The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
tr	Sing	Bush
tr	Sing	Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan .
tr	Sing	"Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as "" Lee ."""
tr	Sing	He could not name the others .
tr	Sing	""" Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan ?"""
tr	Sing	Hiller asked , inquiring about Gen . Pervaiz Musharraf , who seized control of the country October 12 .
tr	Sing	""" Wait , wait , is this 50 questions ?"" asked Bush ."
tr	Sing	"Hiller replied : "" No , it ' s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots ."" . . ."
tr	Sing	"Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he ' s just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office ."
tr	Sing	"It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that ' s good news for the subcontinent ."""
tr	Sing	Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan ' s recent coup .
tr	Sing	""" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world ' s oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "" good news ,"" Gore said ."
tr	Sing	""" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
tr	Sing	A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush ' s comments .
tr	Sing	""" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments ,"" said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
tr	Sing	"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with "" taking office ,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world ' s strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" stability !"""
tr	Sing	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military ' s anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
tr	Sing	I can ' t tell you how ominous I found Bush ' s performance in that interview .
tr	Sing	"I still remember him stuttering about "" the General ,"" unable to remember Musharraf ' s name ."
tr	Sing	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
tr	Sing	"He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with "" stability ."""
tr	Sing	And , he didn ' t think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
tr	Sing	He couldn ' t tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
tr	Sing	Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year .
tr	Sing	"This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "" stability "" to the region in fall of 1999 ."
tr	Sing	So , one answer to Bush ' s charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
tr	Sing	Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then .
tr	Sing	Indeed , given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US , one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does .
tr	Sing	"This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : "" Edwards believes that the U . S . must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
tr	Sing	"Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the U . S . has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians ."""
tr	Sing	I don ' t see Bush doing any of this .
tr	Sing	From Friday ' s Daily Star
tr	Sing	By Juan Cole
tr	Sing	Friday , June 04 , 2004
tr	Sing	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti - American terrorism .
tr	Sing	Israel , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
tr	Sing	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings .
tr	Sing	This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
tr	Sing	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
tr	Sing	It is estimated to have some 5 , 000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
tr	Sing	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel ' s security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Sing	Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
tr	Sing	Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians .
tr	Sing	At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
tr	Sing	He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
tr	Sing	By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
tr	Sing	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
tr	Sing	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
tr	Sing	The bungling of post - war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state .
tr	Sing	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15 , 000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
tr	Sing	Anti - Israeli and pro - Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents .
tr	Sing	Worse for Israel , the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites .
tr	Sing	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
tr	Sing	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , which is popular in Jordan .
tr	Sing	Whereas Saddam Hussein ' s dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , they are now free to organize .
tr	Sing	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .
tr	Sing	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country ' s petroleum reserves .
tr	Sing	That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites .
tr	Sing	Ariel Sharon ' s aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
tr	Sing	The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world , including Iraq .
tr	Sing	The promotion by the pro - Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened , not strengthened , Israeli security .
tr	Sing	"Juan Cole ( www . juancole . com ) is a professor of modern Middle East history at the University of Michigan and author of "" Sacred Space and Holy War "" ( I . B . Tauris , 2002 )."
tr	Sing	THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global
tr	Sing	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Sing	India defensive over Sri Lanka
tr	Sing	By Ranjit Devraj
tr	Sing	NEW DELHI -
tr	Sing	"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation ' s two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60 , 000 dead on both sides ."
tr	Sing	And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s four - day visit to India recently .
tr	Sing	According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
tr	Sing	For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga ' s government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
tr	Sing	""" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one ."
tr	Sing	"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive ,"" Muni told IPS ."
tr	Sing	Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
tr	Sing	Kumaratunga ' s India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .
tr	Sing	Colombo , too , seems to be in an intractable position .
tr	Sing	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga ' s government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
tr	Sing	A veteran of India ' s military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
tr	Sing	Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .
tr	Sing	""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement ,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview ."
tr	Sing	Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .
tr	Sing	India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
tr	Sing	Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US $ 4 . 5 billion .
tr	Sing	Japan ' s special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
tr	Sing	"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides ."
tr	Sing	"The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces ."""
tr	Sing	And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
tr	Sing	"She added that recent visits to the island by India ' s top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island ""."
tr	Sing	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka ' s Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
tr	Sing	The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession .
tr	Sing	"In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : "" There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation ."""
tr	Sing	Asia Times Online 16 / 11 / 2004
tr	Sing	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Sing	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Sing	Musharraf calls the bluff
tr	Sing	M . D . Nalapat
tr	Sing	"As Pakistan ' s president had been telling the United States he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this was an embarrassment ."
tr	Sing	The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
tr	Sing	That distinction has now gone to the United States .
tr	Sing	India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China ( which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
tr	Sing	Simultaneously , New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics ), the pendulum of U . S . policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India .
tr	Sing	"This , Pakistan ' s lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told , is the "" minimum "" that the Pakistan army will accept ."
tr	Sing	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
tr	Sing	This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu - majority Jammu , a Buddhist - dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley , with the third state given little of taxpayers ' money but substantial autonomy .
tr	Sing	With luck , the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist , education and services haven within India .
tr	Sing	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U . S . State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .
tr	Sing	Unreported by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded .
tr	Sing	"Thus far , none of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development ."
tr	Sing	Despite Sept . 11 , the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy .
tr	Sing	The U . S . State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and , in most of them , the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
tr	Sing	"That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "" foreigner - led "" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism , has not struck the conferees , among whom have been several Indian "" scholars "" and "" analysts "" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna ."
tr	Sing	Despite many wrinkles , India remains a part - democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op - ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly .
tr	Sing	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China .
tr	Sing	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
tr	Sing	Since then , India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well .
tr	Sing	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
tr	Sing	The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China .
tr	Sing	"Under President Hu Jintao , Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year , making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U . N . Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "" permanent five "" that has not yet done so ."

tr	Sing	Washington Times 28 / 10 / 2004
tr	Sing	During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
tr	Sing	The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
tr	Sing	During this time , F - 102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand .
tr	Sing	( Click here for source . )
tr	Sing	As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
tr	Sing	In all this so - called controversy , has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets ?
tr	Sing	For example , did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry ?
tr	Sing	What follows is the text of an e - mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ).
tr	Sing	Before you fall for Dems ’ spin , here are the facts
tr	Sing	What do you really know about George W . Bush ’ s time in the Air National Guard ?
tr	Sing	That he didn ’ t show up for duty in Alabama ?
tr	Sing	That he missed a physical ?
tr	Sing	That his daddy got him in ?
tr	Sing	News coverage of the president ’ s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
tr	Sing	So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :
tr	Sing	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
tr	Sing	Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
tr	Sing	It was full - time work .
tr	Sing	By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
tr	Sing	After training , Bush kept flying , racking up hundreds of hours in F - 102 jets .
tr	Sing	As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
tr	Sing	At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
tr	Sing	According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ).
tr	Sing	Bush earned 340 points in 1969 - 1970 .
tr	Sing	[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
tr	Sing	- acd ]
tr	Sing	He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
tr	Sing	And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
tr	Sing	Did you know that ?
tr	Sing	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti - Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ).
tr	Sing	Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .
tr	Sing	Requests like that weren ’ t unusual , says retired Col . William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
tr	Sing	“ In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots ,” Campenni says .
tr	Sing	“ The Vietnam War was winding down , and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs .
tr	Sing	In ’ 72 or ’ 73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
tr	Sing	In fact , you were helping them solve their problem .”
tr	Sing	So Bush stopped flying .
tr	Sing	From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points — not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
tr	Sing	Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
tr	Sing	In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
tr	Sing	Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .
tr	Sing	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
tr	Sing	By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
tr	Sing	During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
tr	Sing	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership .”
tr	Sing	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” who “ continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further .”
tr	Sing	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer .”
tr	Sing	Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush ’ s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now .
tr	Sing	And , as it is with Kerry , it ’ s reasonable to look at a candidate ’ s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it .
tr	Sing	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
tr	Sing	And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush ’ s service , while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry ’ s .
tr	Sing	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty .”
tr	Sing	Earlier , Kerry said , “ Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question .”
tr	Sing	Now , after the Swift boat episode , the spotlight has returned to Bush .
tr	Sing	That ’ s fine .
tr	Sing	And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well .
tr	Sing	Byron York is a White House correspondent for National Review .
tr	Sing	His column appears in The Hill each week .
tr	Sing	One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
tr	Sing	I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week .
tr	Sing	There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
tr	Sing	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5 , 000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
tr	Sing	Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
tr	Sing	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' gifts ' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi , a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis .
tr	Sing	Sheikh Naji Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list .
tr	Sing	"Al - Abbudi stated that "" His Emminence "" decided to openly support the list because "" others "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning ."
tr	Sing	Again there is no official written statement from Sistani ' s office confirming this allegation , which I think is intentional .
tr	Sing	Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha ' lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
tr	Sing	"Chalabi describing Sha ' lan as a "" Ba ' athist "" and a "" former double agent for Saddam and the CIA "", while Sha ' lan dismisses Chalabi as a "" thief "" and an "" Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran ""."
tr	Sing	One remark made by Sha ' lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he couldn ' t say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
tr	Sing	It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha ' lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
tr	Sing	Hazim Al - Sha ' lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza ' il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M . S . Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
tr	Sing	The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
tr	Sing	I doubt that will be the outcome though .
tr	Sing	The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
tr	Sing	Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
tr	Sing	I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
tr	Sing	After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can ' t mention here .
tr	Sing	He described Allawi ' s face as that of a f * ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
tr	Sing	I didn ' t argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
tr	Sing	He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
tr	Sing	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
tr	Sing	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba ' athist old - timer who claimed that Ba ' athists have the means to stage a third coup d ' etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
tr	Sing	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba ' athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
tr	Sing	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
tr	Sing	I concur that Ba ' athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
tr	Sing	But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I don ' t believe the US is going anywhere so soon .
tr	Sing	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
tr	Sing	The only hope now is that , following the elections , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties .
tr	Sing	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba ' athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
tr	Sing	Al - Gu ' ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government .
tr	Sing	The Gu ' ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al - Anbar governor some months back .
tr	Sing	The Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid - nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe .
tr	Sing	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
tr	Sing	Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
tr	Sing	Al - Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident .
tr	Sing	I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
tr	Sing	Even partition is not a possibility , there are no clear borders between the two .
tr	Sing	Remember Luis Posada Carriles ?
tr	Sing	Here ' s a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , published yesterday .
tr	Sing	"("" At first I hid a lot ."
tr	Sing	I thought the US government was looking for me .
tr	Sing	"Now I hide a lot less ."")"
tr	Sing	Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials .
tr	Sing	I can ' t imagine they wanted to do this .
tr	Sing	As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
tr	Sing	But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
tr	Sing	And though he ' d been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
tr	Sing	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
tr	Sing	"Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that "" If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you ' ll find out who I am ."""
tr	Sing	But then , maybe that wouldn ' t have saved him either , because Posada is not Meiring .
tr	Sing	Posada can be given up , but Meiring can ' t .
tr	Sing	( Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines .)
tr	Sing	And to those who don ' t even know their crimes , not even that .
tr	Sing	But will Posada be given up ?
tr	Sing	I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
tr	Sing	"I expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial ."
tr	Sing	The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post - Chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
tr	Sing	Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference ; justice would not be served then .
tr	Sing	But Posada ' s nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that ' s a vain hope .
tr	Sing	So instead Posada may be held indefinitely , in comfortable custody .
tr	Sing	An embarrassment to the US still , just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami , gloating in his freedom .
tr	Sing	Meiring is more than an embarrassment .
tr	Sing	"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Sing	So his name will remain unspoken .
tr	Sing	Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
tr	Sing	Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
tr	Sing	I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives .
tr	Sing	I ' ve read the book - it ' s a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
tr	Sing	Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell ' s whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics .
tr	Sing	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross - examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .
tr	Sing	Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
tr	Sing	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence '.
tr	Sing	"Wilson had been able to show that he ' d had more than 80 "" non - social contacts "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution ' s case in turmoil ."
tr	Sing	Then Charles A . Briggs came to the rescue .
tr	Sing	"Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records "" for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P . Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA ."""
tr	Sing	"The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson did not work "" directly or indirectly "" for the CIA since retiring ."
tr	Sing	Last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , threw out Wilson ' s two - decades old conviction .
tr	Sing	Judge Hughes wrote : ` government knowingly used false evidence against him ,' concluding ` honesty comes hard to government .'
tr	Sing	looks like it is rearing its head again in Louisianna ..

tr	Sing	On Monday , Louis Lamonica , 45 , the former pastor of Hosanna Church , was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff ' s Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago .

tr	Sing	Trouble on India ' s islands
tr	Sing	Ramtanu Maitra
tr	Sing	In early February , India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ).
tr	Sing	It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar .
tr	Sing	But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
tr	Sing	It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea .
tr	Sing	Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , which took a heavy toll on the Andamans .
tr	Sing	Deteriorating security
tr	Sing	While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
tr	Sing	The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base .
tr	Sing	It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa .
tr	Sing	This is not unknown to New Delhi .
tr	Sing	A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands , using fake Indian ration cards , while citizens of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave .
tr	Sing	""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell ' s Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners ,"" he said ."
tr	Sing	"An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50 , 000 "" foreigners "" in the Andaman Islands , but unofficial figures are much higher than this ."
tr	Sing	The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns , cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous .
tr	Sing	"One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying , "" Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region ."""
tr	Sing	Considering the islands ' huge strategic importance , it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been .
tr	Sing	In recent months , its fallibility has become evident .
tr	Sing	With growing economic and military power , India will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security .
tr	Sing	Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations .
tr	Sing	In fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti - India outfits , such as the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these networks and weaken India ' s eastern flank .
tr	Sing	Indian intelligence ' s lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling .
tr	Sing	This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid - 1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time .
tr	Sing	The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo .
tr	Sing	In addition , LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers .
tr	Sing	The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now - defunct Asiaweek in 2001 .
tr	Sing	A shipment of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars , left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex - Joux 3 .
tr	Sing	As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon .
tr	Sing	On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India ' s Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka ' s east coast .
tr	Sing	LTTE arms - running
tr	Sing	In 1997 , the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition .
tr	Sing	Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
tr	Sing	The boat was heading toward Cox ' s Bazar in Bangladesh .
tr	Sing	Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante , an island off the coat of Myanmar , west of the Andaman islands .
tr	Sing	Subsequently , Phuket became the LTTE ' s main backup base .
tr	Sing	A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
tr	Sing	"At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "" submarine "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
tr	Sing	Steady buildup
tr	Sing	The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building - up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less - strong militant groups .
tr	Sing	Over the past decade , Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness .
tr	Sing	A number of extremist groups , under the cover of the Islamist movement , have become active in drug trafficking , gun running and anti - Indian activities .
tr	Sing	It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebels from India ' s northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
tr	Sing	The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox ' s Bazar passes through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong .
tr	Sing	Note
tr	Sing	The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans , which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south .
tr	Sing	On South Andaman , the most heavily populated island , is Port Blair , which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago .
tr	Sing	Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non - Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island .
tr	Sing	Ramtanu Maitra writes for a number of international journals and is a regular contributor to the Washington - based EIR and the New Delhi - based Indian Defense Review .
tr	Sing	He also writes for Aakrosh , India ' s defense - tied quarterly journal .
tr	Sing	[ Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Sing	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Sing	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate . ]
tr	Sing	Karzai , Musharraf new regional equations
tr	Sing	KABUL :
tr	Sing	“ The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all .
tr	Sing	Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan ,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan ’ s English daily The Nation .
tr	Sing	Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections , but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan .
tr	Sing	That changed on September 22 when President George W . Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
tr	Sing	The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non - interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban .
tr	Sing	Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting , said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully .
tr	Sing	Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf .
tr	Sing	All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan .
tr	Sing	( Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban , Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb - e - Islami .)
tr	Sing	‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis ,’’ says a Western diplomat .
tr	Sing	‘’ Bush was very well briefed before the meeting ,’’ the diplomat said .
tr	Sing	An Afghan official at the meeting added , ‘’ The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda .’’
tr	Sing	Karzai was clearly pleased at the results .
tr	Sing	‘’ President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban ,’’ says Karzai .
tr	Sing	The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans .
tr	Sing	Until then he had said Pakistan ’ s options were open .
tr	Sing	However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
tr	Sing	‘’ Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before ,’’ says Lt . General David Barno .
tr	Sing	‘’ There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border , but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways ,’’ he adds .
tr	Sing	Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
tr	Sing	Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti - Americanism and anti - army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .
tr	Sing	Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .
tr	Sing	That too may change .
tr	Sing	US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .
tr	Sing	With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections , the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .
tr	Sing	Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
tr	Sing	With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home .
tr	Sing	Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .
tr	Sing	Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
tr	Sing	Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
tr	Sing	“ There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan ,’’ says a Pakistani official .
tr	Sing	‘’ Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously ,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’ s National Security Directorate .
tr	Sing	Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
tr	Sing	In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai , Iran , Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai .
tr	Sing	Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .
tr	Sing	Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .
tr	Sing	With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’ s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced .
tr	Sing	The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners .
tr	Sing	However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran .
tr	Sing	‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters ,’’ says Barno .
tr	Sing	Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran .
tr	Sing	‘’ Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran .
tr	Sing	So far what they have done together has been good for us and that ’ s how we would like to keep it ’’, says Karzai .
tr	Sing	Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan ’ s neighbours is over , but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours ’ interference .
tr	Sing	In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
tr	Sing	It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil .
tr	Sing	Pakistan Link 16 / 10 / 2004
tr	Sing	The debate that a handful of Texas multi - millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry ' s war record is absurd in every way .
tr	Sing	But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
tr	Sing	The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W . Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
tr	Sing	He has never lived in a war zone .
tr	Sing	If some of John Kerry ' s wounds were superficial , Bush received no wounds .
tr	Sing	( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn ' t absent yourself from it .
tr	Sing	That is the logic of the medal ).
tr	Sing	Kerry saved a man ' s life while under fire .
tr	Sing	Bush did no such thing .
tr	Sing	What was Bush doing with his youth ?
tr	Sing	He was drinking .
tr	Sing	He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
tr	Sing	He gave no service to anyone , risked nothing , and did not even slack off efficiently .
tr	Sing	The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush ' s character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
tr	Sing	His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
tr	Sing	"( Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet , "" Let heads roll !"")"
tr	Sing	That temper is only one problem .
tr	Sing	Bush has a sadistic streak .
tr	Sing	He clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching executions .
tr	Sing	His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
tr	Sing	He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
tr	Sing	Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy .
tr	Sing	That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
tr	Sing	But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
tr	Sing	Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
tr	Sing	But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
tr	Sing	"This little - noted interview with Blount ' s nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio ' s "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
tr	Sing	This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W . Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
tr	Sing	"There is one place in Alabama where Mr . Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Sing	President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
tr	Sing	NPR ' s Wade Goodwyn has this report about Mr . Bush ' s time on that campaign .
tr	Sing	WADE GOODWYN reporting :
tr	Sing	In 1972 , Baba Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign .
tr	Sing	Groom was Republican Red Blount ' s scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
tr	Sing	Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas , and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday .
tr	Sing	Ms . BABA GROOM ( Former Campaign Worker ):
tr	Sing	He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
tr	Sing	He was always ready to go out on the road .
tr	Sing	On the phone , you could hear his accent .
tr	Sing	It was a Texas accent .
tr	Sing	But he just melded with everybody .
tr	Sing	GOODWYN : The candidate Mr . Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business .
tr	Sing	Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days .
tr	Sing	Blount ' s support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon ' s postmaster general .
tr	Sing	In Washington , Blount became friends and tennis partners with Mr . Bush ' s father , then Congressman Bush .
tr	Sing	That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father ' s urging . . .
tr	Sing	It was Mr . Bush ' s job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
tr	Sing	Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural counties didn ' t have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
tr	Sing	But throughout Alabama , there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to help Red Blount .
tr	Sing	It was the young Texan ' s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
tr	Sing	Groom says this job helped Mr . Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics are local .
tr	Sing	. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount ' s nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
tr	Sing	Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr . Bush was not one of them .
tr	Sing	Mr . MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ): Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid - evenings .
tr	Sing	Ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5 : 30 or 6 : 00 in the evening .
tr	Sing	GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of ' 72 , Red Blount ' s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr . Bush ' s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
tr	Sing	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George certainly didn ' t seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there .
tr	Sing	My overall impression was that he didn ' t seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
tr	Sing	GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he didn ' t know that Mr . Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
tr	Sing	After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr . Bush about it .
tr	Sing	The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
tr	Sing	Mr . ARCHIBALD : George didn ' t have any interest at all in talking about the military .
tr	Sing	In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
tr	Sing	He wasn ' t unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and wouldn ' t talk about it .
tr	Sing	GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr . Bush enjoyed his freedom .
tr	Sing	He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
tr	Sing	He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
tr	Sing	In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
tr	Sing	Archibald says Mr . Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he ' d done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
tr	Sing	Mr . ARCHIBALD : People have different ways of starting the days in any office .
tr	Sing	And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
tr	Sing	GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr . Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
tr	Sing	Mr . ARCHIBALD : I mean , at that time , I was 28 ; George would have been 25 or 26 .
tr	Sing	And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid - 20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
tr	Sing	I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
tr	Sing	GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr . Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
tr	Sing	Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- didn ' t like that story .
tr	Sing	Mr . ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
tr	Sing	"And he would always laugh about that . """
tr	Sing	Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn ' t remember George telling drunk stories .
tr	Sing	"But that means nothing , since they weren ' t the sort of things guys like Bush told the "" girls ""."
tr	Sing	He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him .
tr	Sing	Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger .
tr	Sing	It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .
tr	Sing	When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
tr	Sing	Just remember that death is not the end
tr	Sing	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
tr	Sing	Just remember that death is not the end - Bob Dylan
tr	Sing	Afraid I don ' t have time today to discuss these , but some stories need attention :
tr	Sing	"From Wednesday ' s Mirror the headline , "" Have 200 , 000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists ?"""
tr	Sing	( also see this thread on the RI discussion board ):
tr	Sing	The 99 - tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia .
tr	Sing	But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
tr	Sing	And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered .
tr	Sing	It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq ' s police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
tr	Sing	"Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : "" It ' s unbelievable that no one can account for 200 , 000 assault rifles ."
tr	Sing	"If these weapons have gone missing it ' s a terrifying prospect ."""
tr	Sing	"A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "" any weapons from Bosnia "" and added they were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia ""."
tr	Sing	"A NATO spokesman said : "" There ' s no tracking mechanism to ensure they don ' t fall into the wrong hands ."
tr	Sing	This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re - routed to al - Qaeda .
tr	Sing	The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it ' s one of Victor Bout ' s .
tr	Sing	It ' s always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration ' s harshest mainstream critics .
tr	Sing	"But then , even to talk of an "" administration "" may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative government means in the United States these days , and how much of "" national security "" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns ."
tr	Sing	But Bout ' s name isn ' t likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media ' s frothing triviality .
tr	Sing	Meanwhile , a decision ' s been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson .
tr	Sing	And it ' s guilty :
tr	Sing	The Rev . Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury ' s guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
tr	Sing	The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
tr	Sing	An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
tr	Sing	""" It was about how he could humiliate her the most ,"" prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments ."
tr	Sing	""" He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself ."""
tr	Sing	From SNAP ' s statement on the Robinson conviction :
tr	Sing	When victims and witnesses stay silent , nothing changes .
tr	Sing	The murder weapon , Robinson ' s letter opener :
tr	Sing	Finally , from an email , a follow - up on the reopening of the investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders :
tr	Sing	Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ... the man who reopened the investigations last year , is mysteriously stepping down .
tr	Sing	SNAP is right in part .
tr	Sing	The will is another matter .
tr	Sing	That ' s still the domain of those who don ' t .
tr	Sing	Have you sent this to congress yet ?
tr	Sing	talk about law enforcement not having the will ...
tr	Sing	CRACKDOWN ON POLYGAMY GROUP
tr	Sing	"Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI ' s list of "" Ten Most Wanted Fugitives ,"" a move that caps law enforcement ' s dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ...[ because of ] the impact that the group ' s practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women ."
tr	Sing	"Specifically , Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "" spiritual "" marriages for girls and older men ."
tr	Sing	In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
tr	Sing	As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo - Nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs has preached racism as well .
tr	Sing	"An editorial in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "" the state ' s history , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet ' s nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach lawmakers and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities ."""
tr	Sing	Maybe I ' m missing something here , but how , exactly , does one ' Loose ' 200 , 000 AK47 ' s ?
tr	Sing	""" There ' s no tracking mechanism in place ""?!?!?"
tr	Sing	No need to worry .
tr	Sing	I ' m sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
tr	Sing	just go here , its simply amazing
tr	Sing	The Raw Story
tr	Sing	i count like 14 explosive headlines .
tr	Sing	Then , of course , there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case ...
tr	Sing	I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
tr	Sing	Of course law enforcement has dragged it ' s feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
tr	Sing	Personally I don ' t give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
tr	Sing	It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
tr	Sing	In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
tr	Sing	a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
tr	Sing	It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child .
tr	Sing	The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure .
tr	Sing	look up fumarase deficiency for more info .
tr	Sing	Also look up the kingston family .
tr	Sing	One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father ' s own brother .
tr	Sing	no one was charged for forced marriage , only the beating .
tr	Sing	It ' s a good thing too .
tr	Sing	Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate .
tr	Sing	Just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy , huh ?
tr	Sing	Christ , you ' d think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots .
tr	Sing	I suppose that it ' s damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots .
tr	Sing	A country deserves the leaders it has , my friends ...
tr	Sing	And MEK -- the Iranian ( not Iraqi ) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult :
tr	Sing	As the leaders like to boast , the Mujahedeen is a family affair .
tr	Sing	When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
tr	Sing	Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
tr	Sing	'' Every morning and night , the kids , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute them and shout praises to them ,'' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told me .
tr	Sing	Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
tr	Sing	Which may explain the pattern to their stories : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .

tr	Sing	One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don ' t know what they are , don ' t care , or know perfectly well .

tr	Sing	Here ' s a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst ( Degenerate Art ) exhibit of 1937 :
tr	Sing	Ironically ( or perhaps not ), the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
tr	Sing	Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .
tr	Sing	When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .

tr	Sing	Is the distinction accurate and valid ?
tr	Sing	Does the distinction actually exist ?
tr	Sing	This is where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum comes into play .

tr	Sing	Why don ' t you state it ?
tr	Sing	Here ' s another interesting example :

tr	Sing	I ' m a regular poster but for some reason blogger won ' t let me in today ... but sign me TroubleFunk .
tr	Sing	Tronicus :
tr	Sing	For example , is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?
tr	Sing	Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
tr	Sing	Similarly , is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system ?
tr	Sing	In my opinion , people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems .
tr	Sing	The ' high weirdness ' and more hardcore political ' factions ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
tr	Sing	In regards to death metal , the problem is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture .
tr	Sing	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
tr	Sing	Tronicus , if you ' re still checking this thread :
tr	Sing	A bit of a knee - jerk reaction from me there , and I apologize for my over - generalizations .

tr	Sing	I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
tr	Sing	Whie I don ' t subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
tr	Sing	Again , I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly .
tr	Sing	( The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic ....)
tr	Sing	I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non - violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it ' s important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
tr	Sing	Peace .
tr	Sing	The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns , and then 200 , 000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus .
tr	Sing	I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US ' s local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
tr	Sing	Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e - mail .
tr	Sing	It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi - nation corporation .
tr	Sing	It ' s a long but very worthwhile read .
tr	Sing	""" A View from the Eye of the Storm """
tr	Sing	Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi - national corporation , April , 2004 :
tr	Sing	""" As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological "" entertainment "" in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come ."
tr	Sing	I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
tr	Sing	My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
tr	Sing	I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
tr	Sing	However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
tr	Sing	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
tr	Sing	I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non - Arab and also significant non - Moslem minorities .
tr	Sing	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
tr	Sing	Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
tr	Sing	Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
tr	Sing	The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Sing	Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
tr	Sing	Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60 ' s because of Israel .
tr	Sing	Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
tr	Sing	The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Sing	The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
tr	Sing	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
tr	Sing	Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
tr	Sing	The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
tr	Sing	Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
tr	Sing	According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U . N ., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
tr	Sing	The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
tr	Sing	And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
tr	Sing	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
tr	Sing	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
tr	Sing	A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
tr	Sing	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
tr	Sing	* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder .*
tr	Sing	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
tr	Sing	Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
tr	Sing	It is a very potent psychological weapon .
tr	Sing	Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
tr	Sing	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
tr	Sing	September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
tr	Sing	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
tr	Sing	So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
tr	Sing	It creates headlines .
tr	Sing	It is spectacular .
tr	Sing	It is frightening .
tr	Sing	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
tr	Sing	It is always shown on television in great detail .
tr	Sing	One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
tr	Sing	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
tr	Sing	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
tr	Sing	The U . S . and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
tr	Sing	But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
tr	Sing	Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
tr	Sing	Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
tr	Sing	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
tr	Sing	And it is a war !
tr	Sing	Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
tr	Sing	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
tr	Sing	No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
tr	Sing	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
tr	Sing	No relative of anyone influential has done it .
tr	Sing	The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
tr	Sing	It never happens there .
tr	Sing	Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .
tr	Sing	There was certainly more despair in Saddam ' s Iraq than in Paul Bremmer ' s Iraq , and no one exploded himself .
tr	Sing	A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
tr	Sing	"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
tr	Sing	Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
tr	Sing	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
tr	Sing	"You must go after the head of the "" Family ""."
tr	Sing	If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
tr	Sing	The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
tr	Sing	Russia is beginning to understand it .
tr	Sing	Turkey understands it well .
tr	Sing	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
tr	Sing	Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
tr	Sing	In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
tr	Sing	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
tr	Sing	The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
tr	Sing	Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .
tr	Sing	It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
tr	Sing	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr . Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
tr	Sing	Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
tr	Sing	But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
tr	Sing	Mr . Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
tr	Sing	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
tr	Sing	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
tr	Sing	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
tr	Sing	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
tr	Sing	Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
tr	Sing	I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
tr	Sing	"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam ' s regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration ""."
tr	Sing	You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
tr	Sing	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid - day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
tr	Sing	She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
tr	Sing	"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and "" activist "" by the European press ."
tr	Sing	"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "", the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader ""."
tr	Sing	It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
tr	Sing	He is now being outperformed by his successors .
tr	Sing	* 3 . The third aspect is money .*
tr	Sing	In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
tr	Sing	The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
tr	Sing	This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
tr	Sing	It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
tr	Sing	It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
tr	Sing	The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO ' s and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
tr	Sing	The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
tr	Sing	Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
tr	Sing	The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
tr	Sing	Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
tr	Sing	You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
tr	Sing	Mrs . Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
tr	Sing	* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws .*
tr	Sing	The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
tr	Sing	Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
tr	Sing	Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti - democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
tr	Sing	Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
tr	Sing	Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
tr	Sing	"Does free speech protect you when you shout "" fire "" in a crowded theater ?"
tr	Sing	Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?
tr	Sing	Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
tr	Sing	Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
tr	Sing	Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
tr	Sing	Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
tr	Sing	Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
tr	Sing	Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
tr	Sing	Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
tr	Sing	Do you shoot an arch - murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
tr	Sing	What do you do ?
tr	Sing	Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
tr	Sing	But it cannot be avoided .
tr	Sing	Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
tr	Sing	I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
tr	Sing	The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
tr	Sing	It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
tr	Sing	In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
tr	Sing	International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
tr	Sing	International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
tr	Sing	The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
tr	Sing	The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
tr	Sing	After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
tr	Sing	But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .
tr	Sing	The picture I described here is not pretty .
tr	Sing	In the short run , only fight and win .
tr	Sing	In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
tr	Sing	The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force .
tr	Sing	Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
tr	Sing	When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
tr	Sing	"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" supplies "" from expanding the tumor ."
tr	Sing	If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
tr	Sing	But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
tr	Sing	In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
tr	Sing	I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre - war argument , but I can look at the post - war map of Western Asia .
tr	Sing	Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
tr	Sing	As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
tr	Sing	Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
tr	Sing	Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
tr	Sing	This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
tr	Sing	It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
tr	Sing	I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
tr	Sing	In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
tr	Sing	It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
tr	Sing	It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
tr	Sing	It is ruthless .
tr	Sing	It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
tr	Sing	It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
tr	Sing	Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi - national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
tr	Sing	In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
tr	Sing	It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
tr	Sing	It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
tr	Sing	It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
tr	Sing	It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
tr	Sing	Above all , never surrender to terror .
tr	Sing	No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
tr	Sing	But it really does not matter .
tr	Sing	The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
tr	Sing	In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
tr	Sing	Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
tr	Sing	If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
tr	Sing	It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
tr	Sing	On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
tr	Sing	I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
tr	Sing	But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
tr	Sing	Europe , more than any other region , is the key .
tr	Sing	"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."""
tr	Sing	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Sing	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Sing	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Sing	Al Qaeda , Anthrax and Ayman : Means , Motive , Modus Operandi and Opportunity
tr	Sing	Homeland Security
tr	Sing	"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ("" CIA "") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax ."
tr	Sing	"An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "" unbelievable "" biological attack , the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("" KSM "")."
tr	Sing	He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
tr	Sing	In November 2003 , a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties .
tr	Sing	"According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda ’ s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face ."""
tr	Sing	"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a man named El - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , who was part of a "" second wave ,"" had been casing New York City helicopters ."
tr	Sing	In a bulletin , the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon .
tr	Sing	The CIA reportedly has been quietly building a case that the anthrax mailings were an international plot .
tr	Sing	This is old news .
tr	Sing	It ' s just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI ' s ( former ) theory about a lone , American scientist .
tr	Sing	Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis has explained that while islamists may disagree about whether killing innocents is sanctioned by the laws of jihad , extremists like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used .
tr	Sing	""" The Prophet ' s guidance ,"" says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , "" was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ..."" The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington , D . C . and New York City , as well as symbolic targets ."
tr	Sing	What your morning paper did not tell you , however , was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri ' s right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 years earlier .
tr	Sing	The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities .
tr	Sing	Mabruk , at the time , was the head of Jihad ' s military operations .
tr	Sing	There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development .
tr	Sing	There is an e - mail by Moussaoui , however , dated July 31 , 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months .
tr	Sing	"In March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9 / 11 but was to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Sing	Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $ 14 , 000 in July , accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks .
tr	Sing	KSM explained that Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US - trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative , Malaysian Yazid Sufaat .
tr	Sing	"Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable , has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "" anthrax for Jew sympathizer only ."""
tr	Sing	Al Qaeda ' s regional operative , Hambali , who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat , has been captured .
tr	Sing	Hambali reportedly is cooperating to some degree .
tr	Sing	KSM and Hambali sent al - Hindi ( al - Britani ), along with Jafar the Pilot , to case NYC targets for a second wave .
tr	Sing	It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area .
tr	Sing	Sufaat , according to both KSM and Hambali , did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used .
tr	Sing	That would require someone who had access to the strain .
tr	Sing	But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri ' s decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter .
tr	Sing	The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years .
tr	Sing	He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader .
tr	Sing	"The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "" said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions , which it said were ' more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists , which will greatly benefit us in the first stage , God willing .' ''"
tr	Sing	Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
tr	Sing	Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed ' s taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
tr	Sing	By 1998 , Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime .
tr	Sing	"A few days before Christmas 2003 , after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks , to include in the US homeland , the threat level was raised to orange or "" high ."""
tr	Sing	After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow , Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape .
tr	Sing	He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise .
tr	Sing	Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9 / 11 on US soil .
tr	Sing	"In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop ( from 1995 ) that was signed "" Khalid Sheik Bojinka ""?"
tr	Sing	The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released .
tr	Sing	( Khalid Mohammed ' s involvement dates back to Bojinka , as does Hambali ' s ).
tr	Sing	Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
tr	Sing	In May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9 / 11 Commission .
tr	Sing	He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
tr	Sing	The same week , the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes , they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received .
tr	Sing	"Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "")."
tr	Sing	Zawahiri , Al Qaeda ' s # 2 , is head of Al Qaeda ' s biochemical program .
tr	Sing	The CIA has known of Zawahiri ' s plans to use anthrax for a half decade .
tr	Sing	The confidante and right - hand man of Dr . Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets .
tr	Sing	Another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession .
tr	Sing	Even Zawahiri ' s attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced .
tr	Sing	A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
tr	Sing	The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts .
tr	Sing	There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 .
tr	Sing	Significantly , the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ), upon being contacted , does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft . Detrick .
tr	Sing	Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources .
tr	Sing	In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas .
tr	Sing	At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek , under the optimal method , there is no electrostatic charge .
tr	Sing	In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings , there was an electrostatic charge .
tr	Sing	Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns .
tr	Sing	It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab .
tr	Sing	"The "" trillion spore "" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
tr	Sing	"The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "" bomb Iraq "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr . Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes ."
tr	Sing	USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , in sensational detail , of Atta ' s inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster .
tr	Sing	Khalid Mohammed then told interrogators that Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries about crop dusting may have related to Yazid Sufaat ' s anthrax manufacturing plans .
tr	Sing	Al Qaeda had both the means and opportunity .
tr	Sing	US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9 / 11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 .
tr	Sing	"Sufaat was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ("" JI "")."
tr	Sing	JI has ties with the Moro Front .
tr	Sing	Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda .
tr	Sing	"( Green symbolizes "" Islam "" and Prophet Mohammed ' s holy war )."
tr	Sing	Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat ' s condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia .
tr	Sing	Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $ 35 , 000 .
tr	Sing	"The crop dusters were to be part of a "" second wave ."""
tr	Sing	After 9 / 11 , Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax .
tr	Sing	As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino .
tr	Sing	The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax .
tr	Sing	Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
tr	Sing	"Newsweek reported that a "" second wave "" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support ."
tr	Sing	Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the fugitives .
tr	Sing	"As of March 28 , 2003 , he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre - arrest bail ."""
tr	Sing	Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning .
tr	Sing	It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui , who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology .
tr	Sing	The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
tr	Sing	Understandably , Amerithrax is a confidential investigation .
tr	Sing	The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
tr	Sing	As agent Van Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation said , the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information .
tr	Sing	While it ' s not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought .
tr	Sing	Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March .
tr	Sing	Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad .
tr	Sing	( Karachi is in the south ).
tr	Sing	The family ' s lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station .
tr	Sing	That was the last Ismat heard from her .
tr	Sing	Aafia never reached the uncle ' s house .
tr	Sing	"Perhaps something got lost in the translation , but the phrase "" Chemical Wire Group "" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers ."
tr	Sing	The family ' s attorney advises me that Aafia had no knowledge of chemicals ( and that would not appear to be her training ).
tr	Sing	"There still is a very hot pursuit of the "" Atta - level "" Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting ."
tr	Sing	"His nickname is "" Jafar the Pilot ."""
tr	Sing	A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot .
tr	Sing	"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
tr	Sing	He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also has received pilot training .
tr	Sing	The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically - based preconceptions .
tr	Sing	In early June 2003 , a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta ' s and Zacarias Moussaoui ' s inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax .
tr	Sing	It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ).
tr	Sing	The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
tr	Sing	The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program at Kandahar .
tr	Sing	The present evidence relating to Atta ' s alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq .
tr	Sing	Iraq , however , remains a possible source of the Ames .
tr	Sing	Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain .
tr	Sing	Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam ' s son .
tr	Sing	According to at least some reports , Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad .
tr	Sing	He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax .
tr	Sing	"The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "" liberals ."""
tr	Sing	"Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "" Leahy Law "" to military and security forces ."
tr	Sing	That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals .
tr	Sing	According to a post she made on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
tr	Sing	Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries .
tr	Sing	In late September 2001 , it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists .
tr	Sing	This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remains foremost in the mind of Dr . Zawahiri .
tr	Sing	"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now he faces retrial )."
tr	Sing	It ' s hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
tr	Sing	Al Qaeda had a motive in mind .
tr	Sing	"In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "" lies "" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan ."
tr	Sing	Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
tr	Sing	The FBI ' s profile includes a US - based supporter of the militant islamists .
tr	Sing	"Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "" either - or "" approach is not useful ."
tr	Sing	"The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "" domestic "" the word includes a US - based , highly - educated supporter of the militant islamists ."
tr	Sing	There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage .
tr	Sing	A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the conclusion that there were not one , but two , such mailings containing anthrax .
tr	Sing	( News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun .)
tr	Sing	This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , it is their signature .
tr	Sing	"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ("" Islamic Group ""), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
tr	Sing	The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message .
tr	Sing	( There initially was an outstanding $ 2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program , the reward now is up to $ 5 million .).
tr	Sing	There was no claim of responsibility .
tr	Sing	There was no explanation .
tr	Sing	Once one had been received , the next ten , mailed on two separate dates , were easily collected .
tr	Sing	( The position does not exist ).
tr	Sing	Abdel Rahman ' s son was captured in Quetta , Pakistan in mid - February 2003 .
tr	Sing	That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 .
tr	Sing	Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr . Abdul Qadoos Khan .
tr	Sing	Along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden .
tr	Sing	He reportedly treated them like sons .
tr	Sing	The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM ' s nephew .
tr	Sing	"According to the controversial "" Feith memo ,"" which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi / Al Qaeda connection , Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent ."
tr	Sing	Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
tr	Sing	"As Brian Jenkins once said , "" terrorism is theater ."""
tr	Sing	A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
tr	Sing	"There ' s even a chapter titled "" Poisonous Letter "" in the Al Qaeda manual ."
tr	Sing	"The "" Federal Eagle "" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue - green ."
tr	Sing	"It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds ."""
tr	Sing	"Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "" The 19 Martyrs ."""
tr	Sing	"A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "" In the Hearts of Green Birds "" refers to what is inside ."
tr	Sing	"The mailer ' s use of "" Greendale School "" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing ."
tr	Sing	Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed ' s color .
tr	Sing	By Greendale School , the anthrax perp was being cute , just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
tr	Sing	""" Dale "" means "" river valley ."""
tr	Sing	Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i . e ., Cairo ' s Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group .
tr	Sing	The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
tr	Sing	At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained , recruits would wear green uniforms , except for Friday when they were washed .
tr	Sing	In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise .
tr	Sing	"As to opportunity , though seldom reported , there is a wealth of "" open source "" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada ."
tr	Sing	The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought .
tr	Sing	Zawahiri ' s mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes .
tr	Sing	He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
tr	Sing	We are , after all , in this together .
tr	Sing	Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources .
tr	Sing	Second , hindsight is 20 / 20 .
tr	Sing	"Third , with the "" new age "" Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . in charge of the investigation , it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security ."
tr	Sing	"Finally , the "" Hatfill theory "" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor ."
tr	Sing	"The "" Hatfill theory "" accusing Dr . Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious ."
tr	Sing	The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt .
tr	Sing	The FBI ' s fixation on Hatfill ( at least as rumored by some reporters ) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance .
tr	Sing	Leahy ' s chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right - winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted .
tr	Sing	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
tr	Sing	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
tr	Sing	The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
tr	Sing	The judge , frustrated by the apparent lack of progress , encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed ( and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint ).
tr	Sing	The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory , with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances .
tr	Sing	A search of Dr . Ken Berry ' s residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory .
tr	Sing	Maureen ,
tr	Sing	Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets ( August Board meeting ) one more time before I forward it to you .
tr	Sing	He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc .) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
tr	Sing	I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests .
tr	Sing	For now , this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and / or inflation curves .
tr	Sing	I will send the specifics per Andre later today .
tr	Sing	India

tr	Sing	Anne , Mike will call you regarding Sarah .
tr	Sing	Vince ,
tr	Sing	As I mentioned in my voice mail , Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody , a recent MBA grad from Rice , into his group .
tr	Sing	However , when we were talking about this position , Mike compared Sara to Elena .
tr	Sing	Elena ' s title is admin coordinator , and I know that Sara should not have this title , and honestly do not think that Elena should also .
tr	Sing	I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah ' s duties / level to other Sr . Spec . in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent , or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad .
tr	Sing	If the latter is the case , we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33 - 66K ).
tr	Sing	Thanks ,

tr	Sing	However , with my natural long , I ' m not looking to really trade around the position .
tr	Sing	I believe ENE will continue to be range bound , but in case it is not , I don ' t want to forgo 50 % of my option premium .
tr	Sing	I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy .

tr	Sing	John -
tr	Sing	I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold .

tr	Sing	Did you happen to sign your employment agreement ?
tr	Sing	Please respond to request below .
tr	Sing	Thanks .
tr	Sing	John Lavorato has requested the attached report .

tr	Sing	If you would , please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening , if possible .
tr	Sing	I ' m at xif you have any questions .
tr	Sing	Thanks !
tr	Sing	I understand all of those comparisons , however , the reality is if we lose Dean ( which we will if we don ' t pay 65k + 10k ), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75 - 80k .
tr	Sing	This is pretty easy math for me .
tr	Sing	I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
tr	Sing	I would like to get this done ASAP .
tr	Sing	Thanks .
tr	Sing	I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent .
tr	Sing	Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following :
tr	Sing	Current Salary : $ 47 , 500
tr	Sing	Job Group : Specialist
tr	Sing	YE PRC Rating : Satisfactory
tr	Sing	Original Proposition :
tr	Sing	Base Salary 65k
tr	Sing	1 Year Agreement
tr	Sing	$ 5 , 000 signing
tr	Sing	Revised Proposal :
tr	Sing	Base Salary : 55k
tr	Sing	1 Year agreement
tr	Sing	$ 5 , 000 signing
tr	Sing	Business Case : If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $ 10 , 000 increase ( approximately 25 %) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
tr	Sing	Also , the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66k .
tr	Sing	It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted .
tr	Sing	Secondly , he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg . Paul Thomas , Jason Choate , Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai .
tr	Sing	Salary Listing in Job Group :
tr	Sing	Maria Valdes superior $ 62 , 500
tr	Sing	Paul Thomas excellent $ 55 , 008
tr	Sing	Jason Choate excellent $ 60 , 008
tr	Sing	Todd DeCook strong $ 42 , 008
tr	Sing	Peter Makkai strong $ 47 , 500
tr	Sing	Let me know your thoughts .... then I will run it by Oxley .

tr	Sing	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications ( now Enron WarpSpeed Services , Inc . 83N ), and then dissolved upon completion of merger .
tr	Sing	Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities , but no I / S items .
tr	Sing	83N is my responsibility .
tr	Sing	I think this entity should stay with 83N .
tr	Sing	So I suggest it be assigned to Leon .
tr	Sing	It should be 4 - easy .
tr	Sing	1579 - EBS Network Co . Division of 17H .
tr	Sing	This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group .
tr	Sing	Not currently on our list of companies .
tr	Sing	I think this could go to either Holding / Administrative Companies ( Same as 17H ) or Network & Services ( Leon ).
tr	Sing	1691 - EPI - EBS Europe
tr	Sing	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities .
tr	Sing	Broke out the activities of 1179 .
tr	Sing	A similar entity ( 1179 ) was assigned to Commodity and Trade ( Todd Richards and Mary Fischer ) so this one should be assigned to them as well .
tr	Sing	1307 - EBIC - Apache , LLC
tr	Sing	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a CFC .
tr	Sing	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ).
tr	Sing	Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax .
tr	Sing	1689 - EPI - EBS Ventures , LLC
tr	Sing	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities .
tr	Sing	Broke out the activities of 1307 .
tr	Sing	It should be assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ).

tr	Sing	Virginia ,
tr	Sing	I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .
tr	Sing	I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
tr	Sing	By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent .
tr	Sing	I have also purchased an Appel in the last month .
tr	Sing	I am interested in several artists .
tr	Sing	Actually , a lot .
tr	Sing	I will be looking for one or more of the following .
tr	Sing	My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like .
tr	Sing	I listed all of our ( sometimes mine vs . my wife ' s favorites and priorities ).
tr	Sing	They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
tr	Sing	I want signed and numbered .
tr	Sing	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
tr	Sing	I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive .
tr	Sing	For example , I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper .
tr	Sing	At least that is what I am thinking now .
tr	Sing	Bonnard ( colorful only )
tr	Sing	Lautrec
tr	Sing	Suerat ( any works on paper ? -
tr	Sing	I don ' t know that he did any )
tr	Sing	Braque
tr	Sing	Moore
tr	Sing	Arp
tr	Sing	Rouault
tr	Sing	Modrian
tr	Sing	Rothko
tr	Sing	Kline
tr	Sing	Motherwell
tr	Sing	By the way , I am interested in re - looking at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that your gallery had a couple of years ago .
tr	Sing	"It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling )."
tr	Sing	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20 , 000 .
tr	Sing	Is there 1 available ?
tr	Sing	Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .
tr	Sing	Thanks ,

tr	Sing	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
tr	Sing	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
tr	Sing	I ' m looking for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart ' s files ( haven ' t checked closely yet ).
tr	Sing	If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
tr	Sing	Thanks ,
tr	Sing	Kay
tr	Sing	I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project .

tr	Sing	On the issue of the contracts , the draft says that the $ 170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed .
tr	Sing	Thanks ,
tr	Sing	Kay
tr	Sing	1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i . e ., ONSI would be a lot more money ).
tr	Sing	Hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
tr	Sing	2 . The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .
tr	Sing	In order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 .
tr	Sing	In my opinion , we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached .
tr	Sing	I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI .
tr	Sing	Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
tr	Sing	3 . I expect at least one EPC contract per project .
tr	Sing	Remarkably clear explanation .
tr	Sing	Mom ' s birthday is tommorow .

tr	Sing	Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle ' s help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
tr	Sing	Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
tr	Sing	Mike
tr	Sing	Late Jan sounds great .
tr	Sing	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation ( big dance that she and I are committed to help with ), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion .
tr	Sing	I believe that these are three weekends in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th .
tr	Sing	So the last weekend in January would work well ( and I will need a rest from formal affairs !).
tr	Sing	Does that work for you ?
tr	Sing	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
tr	Sing	Saturday probably works better for me , just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon !!
tr	Sing	Talked to the little mother - to - be .
tr	Sing	She said a shower would be grand .
tr	Sing	She has some big presentation mid - January .
tr	Sing	How does late January sound to you .
tr	Sing	Am I turning into Mother ?
tr	Sing	Cindy
tr	Sing	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
tr	Sing	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John ' s name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent )?
tr	Sing	Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ?
tr	Sing	With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .
tr	Sing	I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .
tr	Sing	Finally , a question regarding timing .
tr	Sing	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent ' s return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .
tr	Sing	I don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .
tr	Sing	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards .
tr	Sing	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .
tr	Sing	There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report .
tr	Sing	Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this , and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New .
tr	Sing	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against .
tr	Sing	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
tr	Sing	Sorry that this response looks so long .
tr	Sing	I have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so I hope that it makes sense .
tr	Sing	Thanks for sharing this with me .
tr	Sing	Since you asked for input , I hope that you don ' t mind that I gave you some .

tr	Sing	Steve :
tr	Sing	At this point , our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems .
tr	Sing	IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains .
tr	Sing	This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
tr	Sing	WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
tr	Sing	HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous .
tr	Sing	HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .
tr	Sing	Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e - mail ).
tr	Sing	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
tr	Sing	The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .

tr	Sing	She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives .
tr	Sing	"Ms . Walters approached one of the women and said , "" This is marvelous ."

tr	Sing	I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality .
tr	Sing	I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures .

tr	Sing	I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman , Morgan , BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours .
tr	Sing	Talk about a shotgun marriage !
tr	Sing	I ' m very proud of what we ' ve done .

tr	Sing	Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable .

tr	Sing	Joe -
tr	Sing	I am going to find out how much line we currently have available ... you probably already have this .

tr	Sing	What ' s happening ?
tr	Sing	I understand you have a brand new truck .
tr	Sing	Must be nice having money !!
tr	Sing	I need 2 things from you .
tr	Sing	1 . I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to change it over to you name .
tr	Sing	What do you think ?
tr	Sing	If that ' s ok , how do you want your name to show up on the title and what address should I use ?
tr	Sing	2 . I ' m getting ready to divy up the Dow stock .
tr	Sing	Last thing , send me a million dollars , I ' m tired of working .
tr	Sing	I thought we only had cashout , at most 3 times , before this June .
tr	Sing	I can ' t remember .
tr	Sing	I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year .
tr	Sing	I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico .
tr	Sing	Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000 - Dec 2000 ?
tr	Sing	Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months ?
tr	Sing	Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month .
tr	Sing	I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced .
tr	Sing	Thanks

tr	Sing	His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L . L . C .

tr	Sing	1 ) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2 ) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement .
tr	Sing	This language has been included in the attached draft .
tr	Sing	My goal , however optimistic , is to execute the risk policy by the end of today .
tr	Sing	Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day .

tr	Sing	It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn ' t know anything about it and get them to initial it .
tr	Sing	I can print it here , initial it , and fax it to whomever you want .
tr	Sing	Plus , I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that , instead of having a lawyer she hasn ' t dealt with initial it .
tr	Sing	She is very conscientious about what she signs , and who initials what .
tr	Sing	Is the attached form the final final form ?
tr	Sing	Where and to whom do you want it faxed ?
tr	Sing	Thanks ,
tr	Sing	Kay
tr	Sing	Since it will be Janet signing , it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first .

tr	Sing	It was good to hear from you !
tr	Sing	It ' s funny , because usually it ' s just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia doesn ' t really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me !), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
tr	Sing	It was good having the girls down .
tr	Sing	It ' s not for the meek .
tr	Sing	It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
tr	Sing	She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses ( when you play you ' ll see why you can know everyone elses hands !).
tr	Sing	I expect Craig didn ' t want Mom to see his place because it was messy .
tr	Sing	I think compared to my house , he ' s embarrased about his apartment .
tr	Sing	Then , also , he ' s got so much stuff in there right now , that I don ' t know how he ' s going to fit baby stuff .
tr	Sing	So he ' s going to have to start looking for another place .
tr	Sing	And his apartment is so run down down I ' m afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby .
tr	Sing	I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
tr	Sing	You ' ll have to come visit to check out my new house .
tr	Sing	"The upstairs "" guest suite "" is pretty neat ."
tr	Sing	It ' s got its own bathroom and tv , and is pretty cozy .
tr	Sing	As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes , if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn ' t tell by his voice .
tr	Sing	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
tr	Sing	But , I guess , it ' s a start ...
tr	Sing	I ' ve already made my XMAS plans .
tr	Sing	I leave the evening of the 21st , my flight comes in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am .

tr	Sing	Hey there yourself ,
tr	Sing	Sorry I haven ' t written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated .
tr	Sing	I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don ' t think I ' m going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
tr	Sing	As much fun as they are , I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them .
tr	Sing	As for Ted , things are still going well although I haven ' t see him at all this week ( we are two very busy people ).
tr	Sing	In one sense it ' s great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
tr	Sing	Anyway , I ' m sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
tr	Sing	I ' m planning on dragging him to at least one of the U . T . games , I just have to find out when he wants to go ( as well as properly prepare him for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that is a U . T . game ).
tr	Sing	"I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" Rent "" and it was wonderful ."
tr	Sing	Also , I ' m going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot ' s daughter Julie .
tr	Sing	Needless to say I am very excited .
tr	Sing	Susan
tr	Sing	Hey girlie ,
tr	Sing	How are you doing ?
tr	Sing	Haven ' t heard from you in a while .
tr	Sing	A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul .
tr	Sing	Are you really ?
tr	Sing	In any case , we have had some more time to do some exploring ( and shopping ), so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come .
tr	Sing	I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
tr	Sing	Take care ,

tr	Sing	Hey Tonto ( a . k . a - the trusty , but silent , side - kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D )
tr	Sing	The play was very good and I think well received .
tr	Sing	I ' d forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
tr	Sing	I caught the third day of Corey ' s Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job !).
tr	Sing	Anyway , I ' m sure I ' d mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
tr	Sing	As a result of that , she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me ( The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia ).
tr	Sing	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went .
tr	Sing	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn ' t spell her name right in the email - I mean it ' s such a common spelling .
tr	Sing	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they ' d make a good match ?
tr	Sing	She ' s a very fun girl .
tr	Sing	Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch .
tr	Sing	"Good luck with all of the "" fun "" meetings ."

tr	Sing	How was the play ?
tr	Sing	I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re - run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11 : 30 .
tr	Sing	Smart girl .
tr	Sing	I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
tr	Sing	I ' ll talk to you later .
tr	Sing	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
tr	Sing	I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully .
tr	Sing	At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things .
tr	Sing	However , having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors .
tr	Sing	Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have established , I have the memory of an elephant ).
tr	Sing	I ' ll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
tr	Sing	Now back to what ' s really important ... you .
tr	Sing	Thought you ' d like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec . 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it ' s all about you and your needs .

tr	Sing	Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann , I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $ 8M each : one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f / b / o Enron , and one by Enron Inc . f / b / o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing .
tr	Sing	I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $ 10M for each party , but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly .
tr	Sing	Let me know if this is your understanding , as well .
tr	Sing	After you have had the chance to review the attached , please send me a marked - up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there .

tr	Sing	Hi everyone ,
tr	Sing	I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P & L #' s right , if nothing were done the month end P & L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
tr	Sing	Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end )?
tr	Sing	If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
tr	Sing	Let me know if one of you could help me do this .
tr	Sing	Karim .
tr	Sing	Evidently , this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now .
tr	Sing	There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value .

tr	Sing	Dear Justin
tr	Sing	Marly asked me to respond to you .
tr	Sing	As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
tr	Sing	Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
tr	Sing	Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ), I ' d say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
tr	Sing	However , if you use a particular logo for the on - line service , that should be registered .
tr	Sing	I hope the above is clear .

tr	Sing	Please find attached the most recent update for Merchanting Metals .
tr	Sing	In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are behind schedule .
tr	Sing	Please contact me if you require any additional information
tr	Sing	Mike
tr	Sing	Mike Jordan
tr	Sing	The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account
tr	Sing	Consequently I need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the following :
tr	Sing	I will discuss with AA the following
tr	Sing	an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
tr	Sing	The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
tr	Sing	The signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate ' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
tr	Sing	A reconciling difference of $ 15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p & l as generated on the AS400 .
tr	Sing	However , this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p & l values with traders .
tr	Sing	The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
tr	Sing	Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
tr	Sing	the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co - ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ), requiring full download of contract detail for later reference
tr	Sing	reconciliation of stock movements between 23rd and 30th sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
tr	Sing	detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
tr	Sing	spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
tr	Sing	the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
tr	Sing	the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd
tr	Sing	I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval
tr	Sing	Mike
tr	Sing	Mike Jordan
tr	Sing	The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA ' s signoff for the facility late in the year end audit .
tr	Sing	The discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the AS400 Merchanting code , arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality , which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF .
tr	Sing	The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
tr	Sing	The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave .
tr	Sing	The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
tr	Sing	The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers .
tr	Sing	Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses .
tr	Sing	An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations .
tr	Sing	The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA / excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads .

tr	Sing	A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates
tr	Sing	A full circularisation of inventory balances , and matching to source documentation within Enron
tr	Sing	Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
tr	Sing	Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
tr	Sing	Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account

tr	Sing	Dr . Harris :
tr	Sing	I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application .
tr	Sing	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year .
tr	Sing	I understand how competitive the process has become , but I felt that with my work experiences , recommendations , personality , extracurricular activities , etc . that this would compensate for my disability .
tr	Sing	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate - level education , so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year .
tr	Sing	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level .
tr	Sing	I also plan on retaking the GMAT test .
tr	Sing	Due to my disability , this will be a monumental task ; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business .
tr	Sing	I would like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you .
tr	Sing	If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year , please let me know .
tr	Sing	Take care and hope to hear from you soon .

tr	Sing	Sorry about that , I was working on the Teco O & M costs .
tr	Sing	Thanks
tr	Sing	Ben
tr	Sing	Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see associated with the heat rate spread option .
tr	Sing	I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
tr	Sing	As such , please provide the following detail :
tr	Sing	What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub ?
tr	Sing	Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/ MWh to value the deal ?
tr	Sing	What expiration date are you using , i . e .: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?
tr	Sing	What correlation are you assuming , 15 % flat for twenty years ?
tr	Sing	Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option ?
tr	Sing	"Are you using the "" SPRDOPT "" Exotic Options function to value the option ?"
tr	Sing	Are you using the $/ MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike ?
tr	Sing	Has Don provided the fixed payment stream ?
tr	Sing	This stream should be covering both P & I and not just principal .
tr	Sing	Yvan , and Ben , please provide answers to these question via written correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding .
tr	Sing	Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far .
tr	Sing	Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC ' s goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
tr	Sing	This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .
tr	Sing	Christopher
tr	Sing	Randy , this is the issue I left you the voice mail on .
tr	Sing	"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to "" work in good faith with CDEC "" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC ' s system ."
tr	Sing	James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info . from CDEC .
tr	Sing	That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS , but it that ' s what they are saying , let me know and we can figure out a solution .
tr	Sing	Thanks .
tr	Sing	DF
tr	Sing	James Centilli
tr	Sing	12 / 14 / 2000 02 : 49 PM
tr	Sing	Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management .
tr	Sing	My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC ' s online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC ' s peak load periods .
tr	Sing	Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , that I have not been able to review yet .
tr	Sing	This cost is averaging $ 79 , 000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September .
tr	Sing	Good point , but I ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .
tr	Sing	None of them did , and most importantly , the winning bidders did not .
tr	Sing	Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates .
tr	Sing	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?
tr	Sing	DF
tr	Sing	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
tr	Sing	My concern with adding the language below is , could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate ??
tr	Sing	Susan Scott
tr	Sing	01 / 11 / 2001 02 : 42 PM
tr	Sing	After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we ' ve done .
tr	Sing	If there are any objections you need to get back to me ASAP .
tr	Sing	df
tr	Sing	One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I ' ve listed .
tr	Sing	Please provide me your thoughts asap .

tr	Sing	I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM ' s spies intercepted .
tr	Sing	She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him .
tr	Sing	Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer ' s duplicity , but after tempers cooled , MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response .
tr	Sing	As it stands , MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers .
tr	Sing	Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he ' s on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation .
tr	Sing	Yea -- it was outstanding news !

tr	Sing	Jean & Thane --
tr	Sing	Jim
tr	Sing	Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information .
tr	Sing	The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue , providing specific examples and proposing the solution .
tr	Sing	Grand - standing is ignored .
tr	Sing	Thane and I also visited with him .
tr	Sing	Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed .
tr	Sing	( Even though he has bigger things to do in D . C ., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas , the repercussions could be global .)
tr	Sing	Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens ( of the Texas legislature ) are also engaged in market developments .
tr	Sing	There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th .
tr	Sing	The forum is expected to be invited testimony only .
tr	Sing	Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot ' s Sam Jones and Tom Noel .
tr	Sing	The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom .
tr	Sing	Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt . Governor , there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions .
tr	Sing	Thane is in Austin on Friday , but is available by phone .
tr	Sing	I will be on a plane to Houston at 8 : 00 a . m .
tr	Sing	Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9 : 30 until 3 : 00 .
tr	Sing	I am available after Rick ' s Friday budget meeting ... are you available then ?
tr	Sing	You are right , we do need a formal plan , Thane has started an initial draft .
tr	Sing	Thanks , Jean
tr	Sing	Jean & Thane --
tr	Sing	Walking out last night , Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets .
tr	Sing	Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes .
tr	Sing	If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
tr	Sing	Jean and Thane , I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation .
tr	Sing	I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am .
tr	Sing	I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick ' s budget meeting .
tr	Sing	Jim
tr	Sing	You may want to discuss with Becky .
tr	Sing	Jim
tr	Sing	As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago , we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities , and possibly electric activities , in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders .
tr	Sing	This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting .
tr	Sing	In the meantime , could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues ?
tr	Sing	What do I need to do ?

tr	Sing	The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel .

tr	Sing	Bill -
tr	Sing	If Sam ' s description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
tr	Sing	The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty ' s name from Global Counterparty .
tr	Sing	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
tr	Sing	That is the source of Tana ' s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
tr	Sing	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
tr	Sing	In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .
tr	Sing	I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and , if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure , please let me know .

tr	Sing	Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill , Inc .
tr	Sing	Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub - to - Legal Link to Cargill , Inc . per GCP procedure .
tr	Sing	Also , the Global SAP team ( Cheryl Johnson ) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name .
tr	Sing	Samuel x3 - 9890 ( GCP ) Enron Net Works _ Global Data Management
tr	Sing	Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Sing	GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously .
tr	Sing	This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename .
tr	Sing	Samuel
tr	Sing	Tana ,
tr	Sing	Please review the process below :
tr	Sing	Sam , please confirm , Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
tr	Sing	Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see .
tr	Sing	Thanks ,
tr	Sing	Stephanie
tr	Sing	Sam & Stephanie ,
tr	Sing	Re : Cargill Ferrous International
tr	Sing	It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
tr	Sing	"Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "" Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc ."" or "" Cargill , Inc . acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division ""."

tr	Sing	To Whom It May Concern :
tr	Sing	Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information .
tr	Sing	I am very concerned about this issue .
tr	Sing	I have the following suggestion for our company .
tr	Sing	This will be safer for all employees .
tr	Sing	For example , I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number .
tr	Sing	I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron , especially when some databases are from third - parties ( out - sourcing ).
tr	Sing	Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number .
tr	Sing	Thanks .

tr	Sing	12 / 21 / 2000 07 : 50 PM
tr	Sing	Confidential Settlement Document Per CPUC Rule 51
tr	Sing	Attached is PG & E ' s Gas Accord II ( GA II ) Settlement Proposal .
tr	Sing	As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
tr	Sing	* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *
tr	Sing	* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *
tr	Sing	* Offers a 7 . 5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
tr	Sing	* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ). *
tr	Sing	* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3 . 5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
tr	Sing	* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *
tr	Sing	* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *
tr	Sing	* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .
tr	Sing	PG & E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today ' s mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
tr	Sing	This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG & E ' s headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
tr	Sing	"Finally , please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in "" Word 2000 "" format ."

tr	Sing	Jeff -
tr	Sing	"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
tr	Sing	Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .
tr	Sing	We ' re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
tr	Sing	But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .
tr	Sing	"OBSERVATION -- The pressure to finger somebody for "" price gouging "" is increasing ."
tr	Sing	"The administration is hell bent on finding a "" fall guy ."""
tr	Sing	"His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "" refunds ."""
tr	Sing	On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .
tr	Sing	At the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked arms in calling for refunds .
tr	Sing	"Bilbray joined the "" gouging "" band wagon ."
tr	Sing	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California ' s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
tr	Sing	He also stated that just everyone ' s just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
tr	Sing	IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
tr	Sing	"In the best case , the clamoring for a "" refund "" subsides ."
tr	Sing	In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .
tr	Sing	You ' re right , Sue .
tr	Sing	Thanks very much for the comments .
tr	Sing	Harry also had a good comment --- don ' t specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
tr	Sing	Will make that change .

tr	Sing	Tom Byargeon , Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana / Texas oil and gas drilling projects .
tr	Sing	This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities .
tr	Sing	Just like what happened in Enron ' s initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects .
tr	Sing	Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25 - 27 API Gravity and 1 . 5 - 2 . 0 % sulfur .
tr	Sing	Peggy is finding out where WD # 143 pumps to onshore .
tr	Sing	Tom ' s group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis .
tr	Sing	The floating could be tied to a Platt ' s index or the NYMEX .
tr	Sing	It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
tr	Sing	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95 , 000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
tr	Sing	Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?

tr	Sing	following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty ' s authorization to enter into the agreement .
tr	Sing	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
tr	Sing	in our case , they are only hedging .
tr	Sing	the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back .
tr	Sing	seems like a 5 second decision to me .
tr	Sing	is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
tr	Sing	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .

tr	Sing	That girl ' s mother sounds like a real problem .
tr	Sing	I ' m not sure how I would have handled it .
tr	Sing	How ' s school going ?
tr	Sing	01 / 26 / 2001 11 : 36 AM
tr	Sing	What happened ?
tr	Sing	Here ' s a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7 : 35am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I ' d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
tr	Sing	The mother was running late for work and could not wait .
tr	Sing	I couldn ' t say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs . old ) and I waited for the bus .
tr	Sing	It was now , 8 : 15 and there was no sign of her bus .
tr	Sing	On top of things , I had quiz at 8am .
tr	Sing	Which I then realized I missed .
tr	Sing	I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own .
tr	Sing	I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts .
tr	Sing	I called her grandmother and explained things to her .
tr	Sing	A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her , but I couldn ' t do it .
tr	Sing	Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8 : 30am ).
tr	Sing	There were only 15 minutes left of class .
tr	Sing	I stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
tr	Sing	I told the bus driver where to drop her off .
tr	Sing	I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure .
tr	Sing	And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe .
tr	Sing	Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well .
tr	Sing	Thanks .

tr	Sing	1 . In Section 1 . 1 , there should be a parentheses after etc . in the 5th line .
tr	Sing	"2 . In Section 3 . 1 , in the last sentence after the proviso insert "" a "" before the word "" change "" and after the word "" in ""."
tr	Sing	3 . In Section 6 . 1 , change 20 Business Days to 20 days .
tr	Sing	Also , add a semicolon at the end of clause ( i ).
tr	Sing	4 . In Section 6 . 2 . 1 I ' ll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue .
tr	Sing	5 . In Section 6 . 3 , clause ( c ) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section .
tr	Sing	"6 . Capitalize the word "" facility "" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor ."
tr	Sing	7 . Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6 . 2 . 1 .
tr	Sing	8 . Where is the defined term Govt Authority used ?
tr	Sing	9 . In the GTC , the ECP rep should also apply to EESI .
tr	Sing	"Also , in the 7th line of the reps add the word "" into "" after the word "" entered "" and before the word "" this ""."
tr	Sing	I will also add granting / perfection language .
tr	Sing	11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I ' m not sure exists .
tr	Sing	"In clause ( e ), delete the "" s "": from the word consolidation ."
tr	Sing	12 . Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6 . 1 .
tr	Sing	13 . In UCC / Disclaimer of warranties , add a clause ( c ).
tr	Sing	I would add setoff language .

tr	Sing	Carol :
tr	Sing	I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .
tr	Sing	Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
tr	Sing	Please note the following as you review :
tr	Sing	"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers ."
tr	Sing	If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
tr	Sing	3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we ' ve had great difficulty selling it in the past ).
tr	Sing	If you are comfortable , we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms .
tr	Sing	Thanks again for your help with this project ,
tr	Sing	Marianne
tr	Sing	"P . S . Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "" hiatus "" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7 / 16 ."

tr	Sing	Carol -
tr	Sing	I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
tr	Sing	I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we ' re all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
tr	Sing	As far as the EEI goes , the only remaining issue that I ' m aware of ( aside from finalizing the LOC ) is whether we ' ve finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions .
tr	Sing	Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week .

tr	Sing	The in - service date of May 1 , will be very difficult to attain .
tr	Sing	Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ).
tr	Sing	Questar may be able to purchase material , but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery .
tr	Sing	Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered .
tr	Sing	Not the usual mode of operations .
tr	Sing	The I / C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100 % of design ).
tr	Sing	Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP .

tr	Sing	Probing the ' palace coup '
tr	Sing	Electricity : A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president .
tr	Sing	September 26 , 2001
tr	Sing	By KIMBERLY KINDY
tr	Sing	The Orange County Register
tr	Sing	SACRAMENTO
tr	Sing	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California ' s energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices .
tr	Sing	"The investigative committee , headed by state Sen . Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : "" the palace coup ."""
tr	Sing	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .
tr	Sing	""" I don ' t know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort ,"" said Dunn ."
tr	Sing	"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter ."
tr	Sing	""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis ,"" Maviglio said ."
tr	Sing	Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .
tr	Sing	ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn ' s committee will find no criminal conduct .
tr	Sing	The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the lights on .
tr	Sing	At the time , generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps .
tr	Sing	""" It was an emergency ,"" Fishman said ."
tr	Sing	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct . 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .
tr	Sing	""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much ,"" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March ."
tr	Sing	""" All hell broke loose .''"
tr	Sing	""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity ,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III ."
tr	Sing	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .
tr	Sing	"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws ."
tr	Sing	The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .
tr	Sing	What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .
tr	Sing	What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .
tr	Sing	Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
tr	Sing	Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .
tr	Sing	Neither the ISO board , which had established the price cap , nor the governor learned of Winter ' s actions until the cap had been removed .
tr	Sing	In fact , the attorney who helped draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made .
tr	Sing	He didn ' t mention anything about it .
tr	Sing	""" In retrospect , we should have told them ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Sing	""" The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor ' s key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment ,'' Maviglio said ."
tr	Sing	""" It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant ."
tr	Sing	"This action accelerated the utilities ' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power - buying business ."""
tr	Sing	Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $ 30 billion .
tr	Sing	Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians .
tr	Sing	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .
tr	Sing	""" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern ,'' Robinson said ."
tr	Sing	""" In our view , we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation ."
tr	Sing	Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .
tr	Sing	Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
tr	Sing	""" Terry did this by himself ,'' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
tr	Sing	""" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing ."""
tr	Sing	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .
tr	Sing	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed , but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos , the governor ' s spokesman Maviglio said .
tr	Sing	James J . Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter .
tr	Sing	""" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark ,'' Hoecker said ."
tr	Sing	What Dunn ' s committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired .
tr	Sing	He believes memos and e - mails around the time of Winter ' s Dec . 8 actions should provide vital clues .
tr	Sing	""" We don ' t know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out ,"" Dunn said ."
tr	Sing	""" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact .''"
tr	Sing	I can dig it up if you ' d like .
tr	Sing	Sue and Jeff --
tr	Sing	I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA ( for customers already on DA ).
tr	Sing	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this ( maybe ?) and our # 1 priority is to work to get the PG & E model adopted across the state .
tr	Sing	Any news on how SCE and SDG & E will move forward ?
tr	Sing	Thanks .
tr	Sing	Sounds good .
tr	Sing	"I suggest a "" blind draw "" on the teams , best ball not scramble on the golf , and as for the wager , no emails from the losing team for one week !"

tr	Sing	It ' s a two way street , of course .
tr	Sing	There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation , but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show .
tr	Sing	Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them .
tr	Sing	"Where is the "" simple "" explanation of the transportation piece ?"
tr	Sing	As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , sinceit is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly cannot change it ' s ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ).
tr	Sing	Accordingly , the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP ( the only one and therefore the one they have to choose ) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract .
tr	Sing	What say ye ?

tr	Sing	the industry of Marriage and Kids , you heard me .
tr	Sing	Marriage is , in and of itself , a noble concept , but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck .
tr	Sing	How can I say such an abomination , ask you ?
tr	Sing	And you might think by reading this I blame the kids .....
tr	Sing	It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them .
tr	Sing	That will likely never change .
tr	Sing	And this is a direct result of the Politically correct , permissive , time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this .
tr	Sing	When you blame it all on society , there ' s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they ' re doing .
tr	Sing	Probably it is .
tr	Sing	You made a choice to be a mommy , you dont get a break until they move out , thats the choice that you madea and that ' s life .

tr	Sing	It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it ' s devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
tr	Sing	The most important question isn ' t whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
tr	Sing	I hope so .
tr	Sing	"Seeing another "" Columbia "" incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas )."
tr	Sing	Maybe one day they will allow space tourism , ( hopefully that will be in the near future ) although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones .
tr	Sing	"You do have to give NASA credit on some things as they have eliminated the "" fear of reporting failure "" culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the Columbia shuttle ."
tr	Sing	Clearly , the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel .
tr	Sing	One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed .
tr	Sing	"The other is a new fuel tank "" guaranteed "" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation ."
tr	Sing	NASA has some PR hurdles to overcome in the future .

tr	Sing	Healing the Collective Body
tr	Sing	"In George Orwell ' s influential novel "" 1984 "" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "" war is peace ""."
tr	Sing	I see the merit in flowing with duality .
tr	Sing	One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one , that there is no separation between you and I , we are all together in this thing called life , we human beings , the birds and the tress , the rocks and the sky , all of it .
tr	Sing	I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body , mind and soul .
tr	Sing	Think of all life , if you will , as one great choir or one grand congregation .
tr	Sing	Our strength is in our unity and harmony .
tr	Sing	Any major dischord and we all suffer .
tr	Sing	Any insult to the collective good brings us all down .
tr	Sing	Living out of synch with nature is the great disease , from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness .
tr	Sing	When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down .
tr	Sing	There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
tr	Sing	What you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you .
tr	Sing	Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him .
tr	Sing	What are you doing to the least of the people ?
tr	Sing	If we are all in this thing together , let ' s play nice .
tr	Sing	Remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else , remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny .
tr	Sing	No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier , we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality .
tr	Sing	In the near future collective choices will need to be made .
tr	Sing	There is no health without peace and no peace without health .

tr	Sing	Quebecker wins U . S . bravery award
tr	Sing	Pittsburgh -
tr	Sing	A Quebec man was awarded a Carnegie Medal for bravery on Monday for saving two friends by fighting off a polar bear with a pocket knife two years ago on Baffin Island
tr	Sing	Dr . Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que ., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two friends who were being mauled .
tr	Sing	""" All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [ River ] valley where we were canoeing ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Sing	Dr . Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
tr	Sing	""" My first thought was to push it away ,"" he said ."
tr	Sing	""" A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear ' s paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling ."""

tr	Sing	""" Their screams changed ,"" Dr . Fortier said ."
tr	Sing	""" I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out ."""
tr	Sing	The bear dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 Mr . Parenteau , knocking him to the ground , he said .
tr	Sing	Dr . Fortier threw a large rock at the bear , distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , who was in the same tent .
tr	Sing	Again Dr . Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
tr	Sing	""" The bear gave chase and I gave chase ,"" he said ."
tr	Sing	""" At some point , Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back ."
tr	Sing	"I was beside the bear ' s head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times ."""
tr	Sing	The bear ran off .
tr	Sing	While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr . Fortier said he doesn ' t think he hurt the bear badly .
tr	Sing	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon , however , were bleeding badly .
tr	Sing	Dr . Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
tr	Sing	Dr . Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement .
tr	Sing	Both Mr . Parenteau and Ms . Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr . Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr . Fortier said .
tr	Sing	Dr . Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday .

tr	Sing	Hotmail
tr	Sing	Founder Jack Smith got the idea of accessing e - mail via the web from a computer anywhere in the world .

tr	Sing	I say why not ?
tr	Sing	The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it ' s not going to go away .
tr	Sing	I have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason .
tr	Sing	Usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used .
tr	Sing	That said , the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :).

tr	Sing	FROM : GEORGE WALKER BUSH 202 . 456 . 1414 / 202 . 456 . 1111 FAX : 202 . 456 . 2461
tr	Sing	Dear Sir / Madam ,
tr	Sing	I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH , son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush , and currently serving as President of the United States of America .
tr	Sing	This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by correspondence .
tr	Sing	I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence .
tr	Sing	I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
tr	Sing	In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my father , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran .
tr	Sing	This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U . S .- British subsidiary .
tr	Sing	My father re - secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U . S . dollars ($ 61 , 000 , 000 , 000 ).
tr	Sing	Out of that cost , thirty - six billion dollars ($ 36 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) were supplied by King Hussein , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies , and sixteen billion dollars ($ 16 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) by German and Japanese partners .
tr	Sing	But my father ' s former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
tr	Sing	My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
tr	Sing	That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance .
tr	Sing	I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty - five percent ( 10 - 25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture .
tr	Sing	The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary .
tr	Sing	I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
tr	Sing	I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried .
tr	Sing	But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day .
tr	Sing	A bold step taken shall not be regretted , I assure you .
tr	Sing	Please do be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal .
tr	Sing	If you do not wish to co - operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter .
tr	Sing	I pray that you understand our plight .
tr	Sing	My family and our colleagues will be forever grateful .
tr	Sing	Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below .

tr	Sing	On September 21 , 2004 , the U . S . Senate Appropriations Committee approved $ 16 . 379 billion in funding for NASA for fiscal year 2005 .

tr	Sing	-- The return to flight activities for the Shuttle program are funded at $ 4 . 319 billion , the requested level from the Administration .
tr	Sing	-- The International Space Station is funded at $ 1 . 6 billion .

tr	Sing	Excellent answer googlenut .
tr	Sing	Let me add some additional info .
tr	Sing	I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
tr	Sing	Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently , crossed a modern bridge , flown in an airplane , recieved any form of modern medicine , did any mathematics , drove a car , used a cellular phone , etc . then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us .
tr	Sing	Also NASA has a large outreach program for education , some people believe this is important .
tr	Sing	Best , Steve .
tr	Sing	Subject : Re : NASA IS A WASTE ! From : jaqamofino - ga on 26 Apr 2005 06 : 02 PDT
tr	Sing	i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers ' money , but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies , that i find it best not to think about it .
tr	Sing	i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste , but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA .
tr	Sing	of course , in a perfect world , tax payers ' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program , and housing for the homeless , but this is far from a perfect world .
tr	Sing	in response to Steve ' s comment : do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone ?
tr	Sing	i find that extremely hard to believe .
tr	Sing	i think it could have been done in a much more cost efficient way , right here on bad - old - planet - earth .

tr	Sing	China ' s insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
tr	Sing	Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol
tr	Sing	The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .
tr	Sing	"The submarine incident was put down to a "" technical error "" by the Chinese government , which apologised to Japan ."
tr	Sing	"But even before the incident the People ' s Daily , the government mouthpiece , had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "" only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy ""."
tr	Sing	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .
tr	Sing	The West , however , has paid little attention to these developments .
tr	Sing	In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur .
tr	Sing	It has invested $ 3 billion in the African country ' s oil industry , which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs .
tr	Sing	Then , this month , it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran ' s nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
tr	Sing	A week before , China ' s second biggest state oil firm had signed a $ 70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran , which already supplies 13 per cent of China ' s needs .
tr	Sing	China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
tr	Sing	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy .
tr	Sing	This year it overtook Japan as the world ' s second largest consumer of energy , behind the US .
tr	Sing	Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .
tr	Sing	"Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to "" go abroad "" to ensure supply , they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border ."
tr	Sing	Japan protested , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .
tr	Sing	China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East .
tr	Sing	Japan favoured a route to the sea , enabling oil to be shipped to both Japan and China .
tr	Sing	China wanted an overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out .
tr	Sing	Claude Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly worth the trouble .
tr	Sing	""" Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world ,"" he said ."
tr	Sing	""" It may be a difficult political issue but I don ' t think the energy content is worthwhile ."""
tr	Sing	Eurasia Group , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price .
tr	Sing	""" If China ' s economy falters , which , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity prices will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets that produce them ,"" Jason Kindopp , Eurasia ' s lead China analyst , said ."
tr	Sing	""" Beijing may end up in a early 1990s Japan situation , where it is forced to sell recently purchased overseas assets for a fraction of what it paid for them ."""

tr	Sing	If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .
tr	Sing	Meditation has to do with what is called ideation .
tr	Sing	It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
tr	Sing	Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
tr	Sing	Your breathing should be calm and relaxed , through the nose .
tr	Sing	Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the air flowing through your nostrils .
tr	Sing	1 . Warm Sun Visualization
tr	Sing	With each breath , feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter , and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness .
tr	Sing	Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .
tr	Sing	Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
tr	Sing	Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea .
tr	Sing	As you sit above the world , the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer .
tr	Sing	It surrounds you .
tr	Sing	Now you are far above the earth - into space .
tr	Sing	Everything around you is so vast .
tr	Sing	Yet , there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness .
tr	Sing	You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you .
tr	Sing	Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
tr	Sing	And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ).
tr	Sing	Try this for 5 to 10 minutes .
tr	Sing	Now come back to earth again - slowly .
tr	Sing	Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .
tr	Sing	Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
tr	Sing	You are in a state of peace and relaxation .
tr	Sing	With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
tr	Sing	Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .
tr	Sing	You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
tr	Sing	This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .
tr	Sing	Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
tr	Sing	A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
tr	Sing	Let your mind and body be totally at peace .
tr	Sing	Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .
tr	Sing	2 . Mountain Visualization
tr	Sing	Another thing you can try .
tr	Sing	Imagine you ' re sitting on top of a mountain , and that it ' s the most peaceful place you can think of .
tr	Sing	Feel that you ' re sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
tr	Sing	Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction .
tr	Sing	Feel you ' re completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
tr	Sing	Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
tr	Sing	"Its meaning is "" Infinite happiness is everywhere ""."
tr	Sing	Feel the meaning , don ' t just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ).
tr	Sing	This is called ideation .
tr	Sing	It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
tr	Sing	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
tr	Sing	Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process .
tr	Sing	Feel you ' re surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
tr	Sing	You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity .
tr	Sing	Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .
tr	Sing	OK that is fairly basic :).
tr	Sing	The important point is to develop some psycho - spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
tr	Sing	Don ' t worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that ' s normal .
tr	Sing	It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
tr	Sing	The main thing is to keep practicing .
tr	Sing	If you don ' t practice , then nothing happens .
tr	Sing	Well maybe a miracle could happen , but lets face it we ' re ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !
tr	Sing	NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY
tr	Sing	But that ’ s not the case .
tr	Sing	Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same - gender couples .
tr	Sing	It presents the case for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .”
tr	Sing	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real need for visible support for the “ pro - same - gender - marriage ” side of this issue .
tr	Sing	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .
tr	Sing	Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration .
tr	Sing	Furthermore , the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration .
tr	Sing	( Since the Declaration is written as coming from “ religious leaders ,” people who don ’ t consider themselves “ religious leaders ” can sign as “ Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality .”)
tr	Sing	Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
tr	Sing	If you have any questions please feel free to call me ( after Sat . the 26th , when I will return from a trip ).
tr	Sing	I will email names and email addresses ( or postal addresses ) of signers to NCRC4ME in time for their “ lobby day ” in Raleigh on March 15 .
tr	Sing	Thank you for your consideration of this issue .

tr	Sing	North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality Declaration of Religious Leaders April 19 , 2004
tr	Sing	The most fundamental human right , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings .
tr	Sing	"This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "" secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity .”"
tr	Sing	"The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “ inalienable rights ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness ."""
tr	Sing	Throughout history , tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families , they can kill the spirit of those peoples .
tr	Sing	> From the shameful history of slavery in America , the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right .
tr	Sing	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
tr	Sing	Likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Sing	The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law .

tr	Sing	The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
tr	Sing	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
tr	Sing	As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .
tr	Sing	Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
tr	Sing	A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http :// loveallpeople . org / usconstitutiona . txt
tr	Sing	Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :
tr	Sing	He has a very high intellect .
tr	Sing	He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
tr	Sing	He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
tr	Sing	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
tr	Sing	"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament ,"" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
tr	Sing	His family loves him .
tr	Sing	President Bush loves him .
tr	Sing	Yes , it is true that some people don ' t like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
tr	Sing	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan . 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
tr	Sing	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
tr	Sing	So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
tr	Sing	"There is an old saying that applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure ."""
tr	Sing	Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
tr	Sing	"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory ,"" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
tr	Sing	And because of this tragic flaw . . .
tr	Sing	""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President ."""
tr	Sing	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
tr	Sing	"But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President ."
tr	Sing	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .
tr	Sing	""" Commander In Chief "" doesn ' t mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
tr	Sing	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
tr	Sing	And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
tr	Sing	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .
tr	Sing	AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .

tr	Sing	NASA & Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing Hoax a secret in modern times
tr	Sing	"Country has an Independent strategy = NASA & company to use "" Numero Uno "" strategy , try to assert , beat , mesh and control the space program of the country ."
tr	Sing	This can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
tr	Sing	"Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA & Company to use "" freeze thawed "" strategy especially when the country has a challenging , growing and ambitious space program ."
tr	Sing	This can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
tr	Sing	"Dependant = NASA & Company to use "" space station "" model to unify the aims of different countries ."
tr	Sing	This is really an end goal aim of NASA & Company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon landing hoax .
tr	Sing	The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries .
tr	Sing	China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
tr	Sing	By MARK CARREAU
tr	Sing	Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle
tr	Sing	Reuters
tr	Sing	China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China ' s Gansu Province .
tr	Sing	A pair of military pilots embarked on China ' s second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days .
tr	Sing	The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China ' s official news agency .
tr	Sing	The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
tr	Sing	His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
tr	Sing	President Bush has directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers .
tr	Sing	"China ' s "" is not a fly - by - night program ,"" said Joan Johnson - Freese , an expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R . I ."
tr	Sing	""" They are not in any hurry ."
tr	Sing	"They want a program that will be a success ,"" Johnson - Freese said ."
tr	Sing	"Economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program ."""
tr	Sing	The freeze thawed some after Yang ' s 2003 mission .
tr	Sing	""" We applaud China ' s space achievements ,"" NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday ."
tr	Sing	He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week ' s Chinese mission through formal channels .
tr	Sing	At present , there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel said .
tr	Sing	The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese said .
tr	Sing	The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi - compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
tr	Sing	The Chinese program ' s second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques .
tr	Sing	The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
tr	Sing	At least one expert believes China ' s intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA ' s planned lunar return .
tr	Sing	""" The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly ,"" said John E . Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va .- based GlobalSecurity . org , a small national security think tank ."
tr	Sing	""" There is always the possibility they could jam us up , make us look like we are not numero uno ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Sing	During the U . S . and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays .
tr	Sing	"""( China ) could be the second country to do that ,"" Pike said ."
tr	Sing	Pike ' s concern is based on China ' s development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea .
tr	Sing	"Email : "" righter ""< righ ...@ sonic . net >"
tr	Sing	I ' m a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
tr	Sing	Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
tr	Sing	Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
tr	Sing	"It has cat ' s "" Meowing "" for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die ."
tr	Sing	The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust .
tr	Sing	I am serious about doing something .
tr	Sing	If I love cats so much , why aren ' t I DOING something ???
tr	Sing	I don ' t want to appear before God on judgment day and have to explain why I didn ' t do anything like this in my life .
tr	Sing	Here ' s the text of the email :
tr	Sing	I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re - read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
tr	Sing	"Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats "" Meowing ,"" I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture ."
tr	Sing	So , if anyone can give me some advice , I ' d sure appreciate it !
tr	Sing	I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
tr	Sing	I will .
tr	Sing	I ' ve pasted the email for those who haven ' t seen or would like to re - read it .
tr	Sing	It ' s also got the website where the song has been uploaded .
tr	Sing	I was thinking , that while I ' m sitting here , relaxing and enjoying myself , those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust - esque death chambers .
tr	Sing	And what am I DOING about it ?

tr	Sing	Subject : Civet Cats , James Rachels + a song
tr	Sing	"This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
tr	Sing	I ' m not sure if any of you know much about civet cats , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles .
tr	Sing	( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non - human animals ).
tr	Sing	"The quote is from an article entitled "" Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem '"""
tr	Sing	If anyone wants the complete article , email me , as it is a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy .
tr	Sing	But this is what he says about civet cats :
tr	Sing	""" As an example , consider the treatment of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal ."
tr	Sing	What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment ?
tr	Sing	Musk , which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive , makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application .
tr	Sing	"( The heat increases their "" production "" of musk .)"
tr	Sing	"Here Kant ' s rule --"" Animals are merely means to an end ; that end is man ""-- is applied with a vengeance ."
tr	Sing	This article , and specifically this piece , effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic .
tr	Sing	If anyone is interested in listening to this song , and in offering their opinion , whether it be positive or negative , I ' d appreciate it .
tr	Sing	But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download , especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine ( 28k ).
tr	Sing	The url for the song is http :// www . sonic . net /~ fsjob / TragiCore - TheCivetCat . mp3
tr	Sing	Although there are no human vocals / lyrics , I think it ' s subject matter is audible .
tr	Sing	Again , if anyone wants to read Rachels ' entire article , let me know .
tr	Sing	It ' s also on the net .
tr	Sing	I was already a vegetarian when I read it a little more than a year ago , but it was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan .
tr	Sing	I hope all are well .

tr	Sing	Blue Planet : Who ' s afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?
tr	Sing	By Dan Whipple
tr	Sing	UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
tr	Sing	Boulder , CO , Feb . 23 ( UPI ) --
tr	Sing	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood ' s grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
tr	Sing	In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan ' s Lake Superior .
tr	Sing	The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
tr	Sing	In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .
tr	Sing	If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .
tr	Sing	Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
tr	Sing	If true , the caper failed .
tr	Sing	Over time , the wolf ' s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
tr	Sing	Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
tr	Sing	This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .
tr	Sing	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
tr	Sing	Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .
tr	Sing	"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf ' s relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
tr	Sing	Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
tr	Sing	""" All you have to do is look at the photographs ,"" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI ' s Blue Planet ,"
tr	Sing	""" You say , ' wow !'"
tr	Sing	"An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow ."""
tr	Sing	This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .
tr	Sing	More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver , for instance .
tr	Sing	""" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people ,"" Beschta told Blue Planet ."
tr	Sing	""" There ' s a lot of impact on plants and they say , ' Who cares ?'"
tr	Sing	It ' s important with regard to the quality of streams .
tr	Sing	Yellowstone has a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .
tr	Sing	Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
tr	Sing	""" I ' m pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations ,"" however , he cautioned ."
tr	Sing	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal ' s status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
tr	Sing	Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .
tr	Sing	On Jan . 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E . Jones appeared to agree with them .
tr	Sing	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf ' s status .
tr	Sing	Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
tr	Sing	Regardless of the wolf ' s legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
tr	Sing	A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home .
tr	Sing	"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic ."""
tr	Sing	It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
tr	Sing	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
tr	Sing	Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .
tr	Sing	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .

tr	Sing	Climate : Humans fuss , animals adjust
tr	Sing	By Dan Whipple
tr	Sing	UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
tr	Sing	Boulder , CO , Nov . 15 ( UPI ) --
tr	Sing	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non - human natural world to changing conditions , and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming .
tr	Sing	Nina Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61 - year uninterrupted phenological records .
tr	Sing	Phenology studies an organism ' s development and life cycle -- the pulse of life .
tr	Sing	Bradley ' s record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999 , spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data .
tr	Sing	The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to .
tr	Sing	The forest phlox is blooming in late April instead of mid - May .
tr	Sing	Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming .
tr	Sing	In England , the cuckoo returns earlier .
tr	Sing	An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one - third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago .
tr	Sing	""" One of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities ,"" concluded a report titled "" Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States ,"" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week ."
tr	Sing	""" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change ,"" said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world ' s leading experts on this issue ."
tr	Sing	These changes are occurring across all species , Parmesan told UPI ' s Climate .
tr	Sing	""" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding ,"" she said ."
tr	Sing	Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .
tr	Sing	""" Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver ,"" she said ."
tr	Sing	"Throughout the United States , she said , "" spring is about two weeks earlier ."
tr	Sing	The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .
tr	Sing	"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 ."""
tr	Sing	"The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "" Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ."""
tr	Sing	The ACIA -- with participation by the United States , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000 .
tr	Sing	""" The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic ,"" said ACIA chair Robert Corell ."
tr	Sing	""" The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth ."
tr	Sing	The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years .
tr	Sing	Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the assessment found , with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice .
tr	Sing	""" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction ,"" the report concluded ."
tr	Sing	As with so much climate research , not everyone agrees with these dire predictions .
tr	Sing	"A third report , "" The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future ,"" completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category ."
tr	Sing	"On the one hand , the IPN report agreed "" Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise ."
tr	Sing	"This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase ."""
tr	Sing	On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .
tr	Sing	""" The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge ,"" the IPN report said ."
tr	Sing	""" A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic ."""
tr	Sing	Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate .
tr	Sing	The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non - commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .
tr	Sing	In a limited economic sense , therefore , the organization can argue warming might be a good thing .
tr	Sing	The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears , checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables .
tr	Sing	This tug - of - war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans , because animals and plants can adjust only so much .
tr	Sing	""" When dandelions have set the mark of May on Wisconsin pastures , it is time to listen for the final proof of spring ,"" wrote Aldo Leopold in "" A Sand County Almanac ."""
tr	Sing	""" Sit down on a tussock , cock your ears at the sky , dial out the bedlam of meadowlarks and redwings , and soon you may hear it : the flight of the upland plover , just now back from the Argentine ."""

tr	Sing	Preamble from BBC leading to the comments further below .
tr	Sing	How has Katrina changed the US ?
tr	Sing	Meanwhile , President George W Bush has said he will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled .
tr	Sing	How has Katrina changed the US ?
tr	Sing	Has it altered your life ?
tr	Sing	Has the disaster affected the way other countries view the US ?
tr	Sing	""" As an American , I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the ' USA and Bush Bashers ' that I am appalled at the number of ' allies ' that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions ."
tr	Sing	What you see in New Orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system , a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem .
tr	Sing	You have seen the pictures .
tr	Sing	You people think it is race , but it is not .
tr	Sing	"It is the welfare society that was New Orleans ."""
tr	Sing	-- Paul , Atlanta , USA
tr	Sing	""" I am frankly revolted by the response of the Bush - Bashers ; "" Sorry chaps , but you did have it coming ..."""
tr	Sing	The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors .
tr	Sing	"At least he isn ' t using this disaster for cheap political point - scoring ."""
tr	Sing	-- Mac , Nottingham
tr	Sing	""" I do not feel it has changed the US citizens which is what was needed , even now the majority want "" Gas "" despite the fact they are polluting the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop , perhaps this natural disaster , which let ' s face it looks like a product of Global Warming , will change their views , why not pick things up with your hands and walk with your legs , other people in the world do it , "" Gas "" is not the be all and end all !"""
tr	Sing	-- David , Kent
tr	Sing	< This man has clearly never visited the US .
tr	Sing	- Juggernaut >
tr	Sing	""" The US will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making progress after seven short days ."
tr	Sing	"Thank you for your concern , but Europe is still irrelevant ."""
tr	Sing	-- John B , Windermere , Florida
tr	Sing	< John can come over to eat at my house anytime .
tr	Sing	- Juggernaut >
tr	Sing	It is always interesting what spin the press will take .
tr	Sing	Certainly , representation of the US in other countries will have a certain depiction .
tr	Sing	I don ' t believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news .
tr	Sing	I have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery .
tr	Sing	Yes , she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country .
tr	Sing	Her husband became a citizen of the US just the week before last .
tr	Sing	( Believe it or not , it takes a minimum of 5 years to apply .)
tr	Sing	The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations .
tr	Sing	Now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue ...
tr	Sing	You know , I ' ve lived in the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life .
tr	Sing	When not in Texas , I lived in LA and San Francisco .
tr	Sing	There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and I ' ve vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi , and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white ( less than 20 %) in northeastern Arkansas .
tr	Sing	The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
tr	Sing	I didn ' t expect to react that way , but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else looked pretty much like me , it was really very eerie .
tr	Sing	So , yes , America has pockets that are more diverse than others .
tr	Sing	Yes , it ' s a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .
tr	Sing	However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
tr	Sing	I don ' t know if this will change other nation ' s perceptions of America .
tr	Sing	I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
tr	Sing	I do know that this will change the face of America .
tr	Sing	I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
tr	Sing	Sure , some will return , but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing , they may be shy about returning .
tr	Sing	I ' m interested in what America will look like in 5 years .
tr	Sing	Will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs there ?
tr	Sing	Or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives ?
tr	Sing	Will the housing market in Dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx of buyers ?
tr	Sing	What will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market ?
tr	Sing	Linna
tr	Sing	Response coming soon .
tr	Sing	Your reply is good and deserves something good in return .
tr	Sing	Juggernaut
tr	Sing	Okay , I ' m new to this forum and really don ' t like Bush , so my view point is slanted and I admit that .
tr	Sing	I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what ' s the point ?
tr	Sing	What I know is that I have a close friend who ' s aunt disappeared in New Orleans .
tr	Sing	My friend didn ' t have computer capability , so I spent the day searching and posting online .
tr	Sing	The family here ( California ) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA , so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there .
tr	Sing	The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available .
tr	Sing	It is Oct . 6 , and not one family member has been located .
tr	Sing	What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he didn ' t order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
tr	Sing	When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become ?
tr	Sing	Recently , Bush addressed the nation .
tr	Sing	About 30 seconds into his address , he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time .
tr	Sing	Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk .
tr	Sing	Even he can ' t believe that he is trotting out this old saw again .
tr	Sing	I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once , you can ' t help but trot it out every time your act is going sour .
tr	Sing	Meanwhile , every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again .
tr	Sing	The gall of it all is that Bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries , when what he should do is pour money into making the US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together .
tr	Sing	Free of polution , free of oil dependency , and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good ( theirs ).
tr	Sing	I ' m sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off .

tr	Sing	<< After having written so far , Don Martin Decoud , the exotic dandy of the Parisian boulevard , got up and walked across the sanded floor of the cafe at one end of the Albergo of United Italy , kept by Giorgio Viola , the old companion of Garibaldi .
tr	Sing	The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly , in the light of one candle , at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations .
tr	Sing	Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading from the waters over the land , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . .
tr	Sing	He turned away .
tr	Sing	He could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare , which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss .
tr	Sing	. . . and uneasy in its corporate expression , was overtopped by the big face of Don Juste Lopez , soft and white , with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud .>>

tr	Sing	<< He could do little during the day , for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas , or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
tr	Sing	At night , however , he slept alone , and the avenger might find him .
tr	Sing	On a certain evening , which had been prearranged , I sent my friend final instructions , for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room .
tr	Sing	I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed .
tr	Sing	""" But everything went wrong with us ."
tr	Sing	In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez , the secretary .
tr	Sing	He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note .
tr	Sing	He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress .
tr	Sing	I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia .
tr	Sing	Lopez addressed the note which I had written , sealed it with his sleeve - link , and sent it by the hand of the servant , Jose .
tr	Sing	I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed .
tr	Sing	At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar ; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks .
tr	Sing	With the death of Garcia , the pursuit might cease , since such a death might frighten others from the task .>>

tr	Sing	The Rock revolution happened in the Sixties ( 6 , number of the Beast ).
tr	Sing	"It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith ( also from Liverpool ): "" Not even God can sink my ship "" ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool )."
tr	Sing	The Rock revolution came from the nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addicts , homosexuals and lunatics ( as that of George Martin , ally of the Beatles ).
tr	Sing	It came from the nation whose king Enrique VIII adulterated the Bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom God provided a wife with six fingers as abomination ( Anne Boleyn )... once again 6 , number of the Beast ....
tr	Sing	"It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "" the Devil ' s Island ""."
tr	Sing	"As the epithet of the government of Satan on that nation , the center of London , the so well - known Piccadilly Circus , takes it ' s name from an old brothel ( the "" Piccadilla House "" which means "" The House of Sin ""), disappeared nowadays ."
tr	Sing	The antichrist John Lennon , one of the Devil ' s main puppets to destroy family , social and moral values and to begin the disintegration of mankind , did hit Stuart Sutcliffe ( the first bass player of the Beatles ) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg .
tr	Sing	Some months later Sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon ' s bruises .
tr	Sing	John Lennon entered stardom being a murderer .
tr	Sing	It will vanish and shrink .
tr	Sing	That was the day that GOD ' S CURSE fell upon the world of Rock .
tr	Sing	One week after that declaration , ONLY ONE WEEK LATER , Brian Epstein , forger of the Beatle farce , died from an overdose .
tr	Sing	"John Lennon ' s divorce followed , as well as his entering the world of black magic , as deeply as to buy the apartment . where the "" Rosemary ' s baby "" had been filmed , previous property of Roman Polansky , and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations ."
tr	Sing	"Came the disintegration of the Beatles ' minds with LSD which has caused , among others , schizophrenic lyrics such as "" I am the Walrus "" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "" Revolution number 9 ""."
tr	Sing	"At the same time , the devil acted through his other main puppets with "" Sympathy for the devil "" that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ), murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin ."
tr	Sing	"Antichrist John Lennon followed the Devil ' s strategy writing lyrics such as "" God is a concept by which we measure our pain ... I don ' t believe in Jesus , etc ., etc .,"" ( God ) and "" and no religions too ..."" ( Imagine )."
tr	Sing	"Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "" Peace "", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of "" The ballad of John and Yoko "": "" the way things are going , they ' re going to crucify me ..."", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine ( today condensed in the "" Lennon remembers "" book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming "" whatever is up there "" for it ( referring to God )."
tr	Sing	The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead .
tr	Sing	It is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times , being seven , as well as three , the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition ....
tr	Sing	"After George Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : "" I want to talk about the divinity of man "", he was given throat cancer by GOD because of those words , which made metastasis and carried on to final death .."
tr	Sing	"To Paul McCartney whose company ' s logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "" Sir "" ( when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir , as long as he produces money for the nation ), GOD provided cancer to the wife ."
tr	Sing	"The advertising farce of how much he loved Linda ( woman whose quality he did not deserve ), was exposed when it was known that Paul had an affair with Heather Mills , Linda ' s intimate friend , with whom McCartney went on a trip to New York and to whom he bought things and presents , while he was still mourning for his "" dear Linda ""."
tr	Sing	At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda ' s death for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity .
tr	Sing	Paul was going out with Heather , but in front of the audience he played the faithful husband ' s masquerade pretending to suffer for Linda , for the afore mentioned promotional ends .
tr	Sing	Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he didn ' t say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much .
tr	Sing	"It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : "" I ' ve got a feeling , a feeling I can ' t hide ..."" in front of Yoko in the film ."
tr	Sing	( He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ).
tr	Sing	Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg , so that he could stand out , being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again , as Jane and Linda did .
tr	Sing	This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
tr	Sing	He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness .
tr	Sing	Besides being a murderer , John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern , trauma from which he never recovered .
tr	Sing	"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him , he made lyrics such as : "" You can wear a collar and a tie , one thing you can ' t hide is when you ' re crippled inside "" and gave declarations to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man ""."
tr	Sing	One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono .
tr	Sing	That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be .
tr	Sing	"When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : "" ah !!.. in Sweden .."", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike ."
tr	Sing	Sometimes back , Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles .
tr	Sing	The Jewish marriage living to the right of George ' s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting .
tr	Sing	The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George ' s house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from .
tr	Sing	"The receptionist of "" Hand made "", the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" we don ' t have any relation with that man anymore and we don ' t want to know anything about him ""."
tr	Sing	It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him .
tr	Sing	Paul McCartney said that George Harrison is a nothing .
tr	Sing	George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon ....
tr	Sing	"George Harrison said in a video that "" Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn ' t be playing at all "", all of it being the truth , but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians , if musicians at all , who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis ."
tr	Sing	Without George Martin the Beatles would have been just another untalented band as Oasis ....
tr	Sing	Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic , and he does lots of charity , thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife ' s life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic .
tr	Sing	He thinks he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived .
tr	Sing	Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people .
tr	Sing	Satan deceiving mankind once again , as so many other thousands of times through the centuries ....
tr	Sing	"After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "" Devil ' s Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc ., etc .,"
tr	Sing	The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve , was because the forces of Satan were behind everything , supporting the process .
tr	Sing	This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil ' s Island .
tr	Sing	If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house , it is because you own some L . P , CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones .
tr	Sing	You have been warned ...

tr	Sing	Attack on Iran : A Looming Folly
tr	Sing	By William Rivers Pitt
tr	Sing	t r u t h o u t | Perspective
tr	Sing	Monday 09 January 2006
tr	Sing	""" The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year , according to German media reports , reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media ,"" reported UPI on December 30th ."
tr	Sing	""" The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week ,"" continued UPI , "" quoted ' NATO intelligence sources ' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah - led regime into line , including military options ."
tr	Sing	"This ' all options are open ' line has been President George W Bush ' s publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months ."""
tr	Sing	An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order .
tr	Sing	1 . Blowback in Iraq
tr	Sing	In essence , Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government .
tr	Sing	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
tr	Sing	If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi ' ite factions loyal to Iran .
tr	Sing	The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases , and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power .
tr	Sing	Iraq , already a seething cauldron , will sink further into chaos .
tr	Sing	Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .
tr	Sing	While Iran ' s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .
tr	Sing	"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran "" has some 540 , 000 men under arms and over 350 , 000 reserves ."
tr	Sing	"Iran ' s military also includes holdings of 1 , 613 main battle tanks , 21 , 600 other armored fighting vehicles , 3 , 200 artillery weapons , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopters , 3 submarines , 59 surface combatants , and 10 amphibious ships ."""
tr	Sing	""" Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability ,"" continued the CSIS report ."
tr	Sing	""" Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional threat of proliferation ."
tr	Sing	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
tr	Sing	"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown ."""
tr	Sing	"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."
tr	Sing	"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective ."""
tr	Sing	""" More concerning ,"" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy ."
tr	Sing	"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect , anti - shipping cruise missiles : ' Iran has obtained new anti - ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines .'"""
tr	Sing	Iran ' s coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters .
tr	Sing	The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .
tr	Sing	In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf .
tr	Sing	Of all the missiles in Iran ' s armament , the most dangerous is the Russian - made SS - N - 22 Sunburn .
tr	Sing	The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude .
tr	Sing	Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2 . 2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .
tr	Sing	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .
tr	Sing	The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile .
tr	Sing	The Stark could not see them to stop them .
tr	Sing	The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf , with some 7 , 000 souls aboard .
tr	Sing	Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force , which includes the USS Tarawa , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor .
tr	Sing	The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf .
tr	Sing	The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .
tr	Sing	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
tr	Sing	Currently , the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs .
tr	Sing	The vaunted American military has suffered 2 , 210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare .
tr	Sing	The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war , a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days .
tr	Sing	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23 , 000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
tr	Sing	3 . The Syrian Connection
tr	Sing	"In February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" challenges and threats "" in the region ."
tr	Sing	This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America ' s condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus .
tr	Sing	An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact , and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces .
tr	Sing	Like Iran , Syria ' s military is nothing to scoff at .
tr	Sing	Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
tr	Sing	Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel ' s overwhelming capabilities .
tr	Sing	As of 2002 , Syria had some 215 , 000 soldiers under arms , 4 , 700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability .
tr	Sing	The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft .
tr	Sing	Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region , comprised primarily of SCUD - derived systems .
tr	Sing	Compounding this is the well - based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf .
tr	Sing	4 . China and the US Economy
tr	Sing	China ' s economy is exploding , hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry .
tr	Sing	China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran , and will receive 150 , 000 barrels of oil per day from that field .
tr	Sing	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .
tr	Sing	Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
tr	Sing	Further , any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China ' s liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz .
tr	Sing	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .
tr	Sing	This threat exists not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .
tr	Sing	More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .
tr	Sing	"Paul Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $ 1 trillion ."
tr	Sing	China ' s accumulation of dollars is approximately $ 600 billion .
tr	Sing	South Korea holds about $ 200 billion .
tr	Sing	By dumping some portion of their reserves , these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U . S . interest rates skyrocketing .
tr	Sing	Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - China holds the cards .
tr	Sing	""" The hardest blow on Americans ,"" concluded Roberts , "" will fall when China does revalue its currency ."
tr	Sing	When China ' s currency ceases to be undervalued , American shoppers in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think they are in Neiman Marcus .
tr	Sing	"If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market , American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression ."""
tr	Sing	In short , China has the American economy by the throat .
tr	Sing	China ' s strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States .
tr	Sing	5 . American Preparedness
tr	Sing	The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception .
tr	Sing	Worse , the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military , justifying the decrease in confidence .
tr	Sing	Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , recruiting is at an all - time low .
tr	Sing	Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point .
tr	Sing	According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E . Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration .
tr	Sing	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .
tr	Sing	Add to this the economic threat posed by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe .
tr	Sing	Iran ' s position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair .
tr	Sing	In the worst - case scenario , the newly - minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play , hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam .
tr	Sing	Conclusion : Is Any of This Possible ?
tr	Sing	The question must be put as directly as possible : what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe ?
tr	Sing	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
tr	Sing	Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat .
tr	Sing	Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .
tr	Sing	Therefore , any attack upon Iran ' s nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess .
tr	Sing	Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe .
tr	Sing	Unfortunately , all the dangers in the world are no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encased zealot .
tr	Sing	What manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course ?
tr	Sing	Look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
tr	Sing	George W . Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front .
tr	Sing	More significantly , recall Iraq .
tr	Sing	"Karl Rove , Bush ' s most senior advisor , notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war ."""
tr	Sing	The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election .
tr	Sing	What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran , and from the diversion of attention to that attack ?
tr	Sing	The answer lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
tr	Sing	The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP gains in Congress , and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away .
tr	Sing	Is any of this a probability ?
tr	Sing	Logic says no , but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics .

tr	Sing	Is there any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Sing	I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house , and since I was able to catch it very easily ( normally mice move at the speed of light ), and since it was acting unresponsive , I thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my friend uses it .
tr	Sing	I know that the mouse will probably die , but I was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison ?
tr	Sing	I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
tr	Sing	Without knowing the exact poison , no .
tr	Sing	A common one is arsenic and there really isn ' t a way to cure that .
tr	Sing	Take the mouse to an emergency vet and have them use CO2 to put the mouse to sleep .
tr	Sing	Or , you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals .

tr	Sing	So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend .
tr	Sing	She loves giraffes and homemade things !
tr	Sing	I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture .
tr	Sing	I don ' t have much money so I bought Crayola Air - Dry Clay .
tr	Sing	I have sculpted the giraffe laying down .
tr	Sing	The key is ... I have a few problems :
tr	Sing	1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
tr	Sing	( like VERY not in a good way )
tr	Sing	Is there any way to strengthen it ?
tr	Sing	2 . What kind of paint do I use to paint the giraffe ?
tr	Sing	3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?
tr	Sing	air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent , so you can leave the wire armature inside , paint with acrylic paint
tr	Sing	taking young cat with me for a week out of state ?
tr	Sing	good idea ?
tr	Sing	i have a 3 - 4 month old kitten and i live in forida .
tr	Sing	i am going to my grandmas in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia .
tr	Sing	My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside .
tr	Sing	she is also good in a carrier .
tr	Sing	Should i bring her ?
tr	Sing	if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside ?
tr	Sing	thanks
tr	Sing	He loved it .
tr	Sing	But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ).
tr	Sing	He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
tr	Sing	If your cat is not trained to use the litter pan , you may have a problem taking her .
tr	Sing	Would pledge be ok ?
tr	Sing	If not , what is ?
tr	Sing	Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don ' t require cleaner .
tr	Sing	If you must use a cleaner , pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated .
tr	Sing	I have had parakeets for a VERY long time , and I use pledge .
tr	Sing	Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate .
tr	Sing	I agree w the answer from Nothing .
tr	Sing	Even a cotton cloth ( I like diapers ) that is barely damp w water will work fine .
tr	Sing	Swiffer or any type of micro - fiber cloth is excellent .
tr	Sing	"I use Miracle Cloth , they ' re fantastic , just don ' t use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them , it ruins their "" grabbing "" ability ."

tr	Sing	can i buy a laptop in u . k and then take it to rep . ireland and put a irish pay , go dongle init ?
tr	Sing	i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
tr	Sing	thanks people
tr	Sing	Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
tr	Sing	And every computer manufactured in both Ireland & the UK are Region 2 aka PAL .
tr	Sing	There won ' t be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital .
tr	Sing	But word of advice if you ' re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
tr	Sing	just a heads up .
tr	Sing	yes of course you can ....
tr	Sing	I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here
tr	Sing	If in dongle you mean USB stick then yes USB sticks are the same any were you go :) hope that answered your question .
tr	Sing	How do I take care of my newborn baby fish ?
tr	Sing	I am nervous that my other fish will eat them , and I don ' t know what to feed them !
tr	Sing	I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
tr	Sing	Provide plenty of hiding places like rocks , plants , etc in the tank .
tr	Sing	Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded .
tr	Sing	what kind of newborn fish you have ?
tr	Sing	I have a question about McDonald ' s Monopoly !
tr	Sing	Ok , I know that Mcdonald ' s has Monopoly going on right now .

tr	Sing	bit of a stupid question but do the spikes / spines ( whatever you call them ) on their side and face area ever go hard .
tr	Sing	becca is right .
tr	Sing	iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time .. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft .
tr	Sing	I ' m assuming it ' s to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies .
tr	Sing	what is a kimberwick bit used for ?
tr	Sing	Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking , hunting and doing cross country .
tr	Sing	It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
tr	Sing	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
tr	Sing	It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
tr	Sing	It ' s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
tr	Sing	I know that ' s vague , but it depends on the horse .
tr	Sing	The rider needs to have independent hands as well , because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)
tr	Sing	How long to save up for a canon t3i ?
tr	Sing	I want to save up for a canon t3i , around 750 - 800 + :(
tr	Sing	I ' m currently 12 and I get about 20 dollars a week for lunch , sometimes a bit more , I plan to save 10 dollars every week :)
tr	Sing	My birthday is in november and I get about .... 150 or more since i hate my dads family .. haha
tr	Sing	Chinese new year ~ 300

tr	Sing	Can someone cunclude how long it might take me to save up for the canan t3i or some extra tips to save / gain money ? : O
tr	Sing	Be happy you get a bit , many of us never got nothing :)
tr	Sing	There ' s a Canon EOS T2i , with the exact same sensor , just no articulating screen .
tr	Sing	It ' s around $ 100 less , which means you get the same camera but quicker !

tr	Sing	hey kido u made me smile
tr	Sing	does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air ?
tr	Sing	its for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
tr	Sing	"took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ("" the way you would icing "") to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "" mud """
tr	Sing	Plaster of Paris does two things
tr	Sing	- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
tr	Sing	- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
tr	Sing	For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm # LGGOBPROJ
tr	Sing	Dwarf Hamster Making Too Much Noise On Wheel at Night ?
tr	Sing	I ' m getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it ?
tr	Sing	I ' m quite sure , you don ' t even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it ' s edges , the part that is making the noise .
tr	Sing	That might work
tr	Sing	Super Pet Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel
tr	Sing	Our Price : $ 10 . 99 to 12 . 99 PETSMART !
tr	Sing	works well lasts long .
tr	Sing	I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn ' t use it -
tr	Sing	he makes so much MORE noise , as he plays and digs and jumps ( seriously )
tr	Sing	Change of boarding station ?
tr	Sing	How can I change my boarding station against the ticket I booked a month back from counter ?
tr	Sing	My origin Station is Howrah , but I want to board at Asansol ..
tr	Sing	Does your train pass Asansol when starting from Howrah ?
tr	Sing	If yes , you don ' t need to change it because you board later .
tr	Sing	In Calcutta there is a Foreigner ' s reservation office where they speak English very well .
tr	Sing	I don ' t remember near which station it is though .
tr	Sing	Even if you don ' t find the foreigner ' s office you ' ll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station .
tr	Sing	This is where you can get AND change express train tickets .
tr	Sing	well if your desired boarding station comes after more than 2 or 3 halts of the actual boarding point , then the TC will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to others .
tr	Sing	so better inquire in railway office
tr	Sing	You might end up as a no show passenger .

tr	Sing	Canadian student visa , can I used for other schools ?
tr	Sing	I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada , I received one that is valid until October of 2015 .
tr	Sing	Problem is , for some reason , the visa process took longer than it should , thus I missed school this semester ( visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn ' t attend ), now I no longer want to go into that school ( because they only would accept me again on September of 2012 ), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012 , can I use the same visa that was issued to me ?
tr	Sing	or do I need to reapply ?
tr	Sing	( in the visa itself , it does not mention anything about which school I m suppose to attend , and problem is , the embassy here in DC are not too nice and would never answer ANY questions ....) any advice please ?
tr	Sing	"So best advice is to go to the C & IC website and click "" contact us "" - http :// www . cic . gc . ca / english / index . asp"

tr	Sing	Im getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT !!!

tr	Sing	Anyway Advice for travelling .
tr	Sing	What is the best way of doing it ?
tr	Sing	anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience .
tr	Sing	I want to go all over :) I don ' t have a set route yet .
tr	Sing	Get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket .

tr	Sing	Vietnamese girl ' s name , Mayko ?
tr	Sing	I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
tr	Sing	The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
tr	Sing	Right , I couldn ' t find any proven source for that .
tr	Sing	And her last name , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?
tr	Sing	Certainly , Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam , only in Vietnam .
tr	Sing	Mayko is relating to the Japanese .
tr	Sing	"In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named "" first name "" according to that of their fathers ."
tr	Sing	It ' s principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
tr	Sing	"Full name of the father is : "" Nguyen Thanh Luan "" ===> Full name of the son / daughter certainly is "" Nguyen .........."", for instance , "" Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan ""."
tr	Sing	I ' m pretty sure that Mayko is Japanese .
tr	Sing	She is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
tr	Sing	I ' m not sure where her first name is from ...
tr	Sing	I have a splitter / filter between my ADSL and ph line ?
tr	Sing	I have 2 phones running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter , I ' m still getting a buzzing noise even when I have disconnected the other phone without one .
tr	Sing	Why is it stil doing this even though I don ' t have the other phone connected ?
tr	Sing	Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well ?
tr	Sing	turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there ... could be static on the line ... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is NOT the DSL ....
tr	Sing	if the trouble goes away with the modem off , then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered , this would include the alarm system , fax machine , satellite boxes , phones , etc ...
tr	Sing	if everything is filtered , and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there , try doubling up on the filters ...
tr	Sing	You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks , except the one which the DSL modem connects .
tr	Sing	Best way to change 35mm film in Holga 120 whilst out and about ?
tr	Sing	I ' ve modified my Holga 120 to take 35mm film and I know that you can ' t wind the film back , you have to open the back of the camera ( in a darkroom ) to rewind the film .
tr	Sing	Do you just take a changing bag with you ?
tr	Sing	Whats the easiest thing ?
tr	Sing	Well a changing bag would be the easiest solution .
tr	Sing	It ' s light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera .
tr	Sing	You can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc .
tr	Sing	It ' s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you ' re outside .
tr	Sing	A changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag .
tr	Sing	A film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field .
tr	Sing	I have a few how to videos for DIY 35mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel :

tr	Sing	Should the statue of David be censored ?
tr	Sing	I ' ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David .
tr	Sing	My argument is it ' s art and therefore should not be censored he ' s making us censor it who ' s right
tr	Sing	no , it ' s only a body of a young man
tr	Sing	the city of florence did at one time in the past put clothes on the statue
tr	Sing	"An art teacher in the mid - cities area of Dallas / Ft . Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw "" nudes "" in the museum ."
tr	Sing	You don ' t think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
tr	Sing	Your teacher knows what goes on in your community and wants to keep her job .
tr	Sing	Let her do it - argue when you are of age and can battle the other adults in your community - skipping of course telling your boss he / she is a prudish ignoramus because you want to keep your job .
tr	Sing	Better Steakhouse in Philadelphia ?
tr	Sing	I am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak .
tr	Sing	I have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu ...
tr	Sing	I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments .
tr	Sing	I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome .
tr	Sing	It ' s narrowed down to Butcher and Singer , Davio ' s , and Del Friscos .
tr	Sing	Thanks in advance for the advice .
tr	Sing	Sidenote ... I am familiar with the Capital Grille , Barclay Prime , The Palm , The Prime Rib , Mortons , Ruth Chris ', etc .
tr	Sing	I have weighed those options and found the three that I have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste .
tr	Sing	I am only familiar with Morton ' s and Ruth Chris .
tr	Sing	I have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do I know of anyone who has .
tr	Sing	I hope you get your answer .
tr	Sing	Anyway , have a lovely first anniversary !
tr	Sing	in his cage in the bathroom ?
tr	Sing	or would the steam from the shower be a problem ?
tr	Sing	thanks d
tr	Sing	If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
tr	Sing	When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
tr	Sing	You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .
tr	Sing	You also don ' t want it getting too warm for him too often .
tr	Sing	Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
tr	Sing	It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
tr	Sing	I would personally put him somewhere else .

tr	Sing	I found an injured pure white bird ( dove I guess ?)
tr	Sing	what do I feed it ?
tr	Sing	I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood , its wing is injured , so I ' m currently taking care of it .
tr	Sing	It ' s pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I don ' t know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
tr	Sing	What should I feed it ?
tr	Sing	Is normal bird food fine ?
tr	Sing	( Because apparently my mom is very picky , she says the bird might get sick if it doesn ' t eat the right food ) IS there any specific food I might find at any pet shop ?
tr	Sing	( petco , petsmart ) ..... thanks !
tr	Sing	make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
tr	Sing	there ' s these little like bait worms at jacks . petshoppe .
tr	Sing	its jacks aquarium and pets I believe . ?
tr	Sing	anyways I feed them to my road sometimes .
tr	Sing	like a little container .
tr	Sing	that should work
tr	Sing	If you have a pet store near buy some wheat , pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do , but do not feed bread .
tr	Sing	how do i get to paris cdg airport to paris montparnasse ?
tr	Sing	i have two options
tr	Sing	using the metro or the air france bus
tr	Sing	can anybody tell me if the metro runs directly from CDG to montparnasse ?
tr	Sing	On the RER / Metro :
tr	Sing	"In the airport , follow the signs that say "" Paris by train ""."
tr	Sing	Buy a ticket for Paris .
tr	Sing	This will get you on the RER B line going into town .
tr	Sing	"Stay on it until the "" Saint - Michel Notre - Dame "" station ."
tr	Sing	"Change there to the Metro 4 line going toward "" Porte d ' Orleans ""."
tr	Sing	"Get off at the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" station ."
tr	Sing	On the Air France bus :
tr	Sing	As I recall , this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris .
tr	Sing	You ' ll still have to take another bus or the Metro down to Montparnasse .
tr	Sing	"On the bus : Get on Bus 95 going toward "" Porte de Vanves ""."
tr	Sing	Buy a ticket from the driver .
tr	Sing	"Stay on the bus until the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" stop ."
tr	Sing	On the Metro : Get in the Metro at Opera .
tr	Sing	"Take the 8 line toward "" Balard "" until the "" Invalides "" station ."
tr	Sing	"Change there to the 13 line toward "" Chatillon Montrouge "" and take it until the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" station ."
tr	Sing	I use GIMP and Its not cutting it , looks terrible .
tr	Sing	Here ' s one of my shots in B & W
tr	Sing	You could also try this in gimp .
tr	Sing	It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
tr	Sing	Open your image while it ' s still in color
tr	Sing	Create a new layer and fill the later with black .
tr	Sing	"Set the layer mode to "" color "" this will make your image blak and white ."
tr	Sing	This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image .
tr	Sing	For more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial : http :// gimpedblog . blogspot . com / 2011 / 09 / gimp - video - tutorial - how - to - convert . html

tr	Sing	I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body .
tr	Sing	Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation .
tr	Sing	Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor .
tr	Sing	I know I wouldn ' t .
tr	Sing	You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
tr	Sing	"Sometimes the "" cheap "" comes expensive !"
tr	Sing	When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections , accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too !
tr	Sing	If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now !
tr	Sing	Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time .
tr	Sing	Maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced !

tr	Sing	my Tom cat will not eat meat just the juice in the can .?
tr	Sing	When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
tr	Sing	I must through it away .
tr	Sing	"If you knew what kind of "" meat "" they put in canned cat food you ' d understand this ."
tr	Sing	I ' ve had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food .
tr	Sing	When you read the label its easy to understand why .
tr	Sing	I ' ve had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food .
tr	Sing	It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive .
tr	Sing	Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you ' re paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
tr	Sing	Your cat will adjust quickly .
tr	Sing	You ' ll also have less spoilage .
tr	Sing	He might be sick take him to the vet to see
tr	Sing	If he always does this , welcome to the club .
tr	Sing	Even if you mash it with a spoon he can ' t do that ,

tr	Sing	My favorite part is going up hill and cantering :)
tr	Sing	I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
tr	Sing	If you took some Olympic - level horses on a trail ride , they just couldn ' t do it .
tr	Sing	It doesn ' t matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
tr	Sing	What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
tr	Sing	That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
tr	Sing	Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good .
tr	Sing	YOU have to spend the time training .
tr	Sing	And I have not met one stuck - up trail rider !
tr	Sing	Same , when I ' m galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything .
tr	Sing	Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
tr	Sing	I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer .
tr	Sing	I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand .
tr	Sing	I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size .
tr	Sing	I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1 . 024 .
tr	Sing	I have a 10 gallon filter on it .
tr	Sing	I also have a powerhead , getting another soon .
tr	Sing	I have a few questions , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
tr	Sing	How would I need to set a sump for this 10 gallon ?
tr	Sing	Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?
tr	Sing	thanks
tr	Sing	Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I ' m certain it doesn ' t ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .
tr	Sing	The piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box .
tr	Sing	On the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank .
tr	Sing	If you ' re going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank , getting a protein skimmer wouldn ' t be a bad idea .
tr	Sing	The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer , it ' s an in - tank design that could easily sit in your sump .
tr	Sing	NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet ?
tr	Sing	From what I understand they ' re pretty much the same thing .
tr	Sing	Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
tr	Sing	Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color ?
tr	Sing	I don ' t want an iPad or Kindle .
tr	Sing	I just want an e - reader that does a little bit more than just read .
tr	Sing	Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that ' s not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
tr	Sing	Or just purchase the Color ?
tr	Sing	Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
tr	Sing	It is like a mini tablet itself !
tr	Sing	When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
tr	Sing	So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
tr	Sing	I ' m pretty sure it ' ll be worth it .
tr	Sing	Have fun !
tr	Sing	Judging by Nook Tablet ' s processor it ' s supposed to be quite faster !
tr	Sing	Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .

tr	Sing	Pubs in Philadelphia ?
tr	Sing	Hey there , I ' m trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday .
tr	Sing	"He ' s pretty much an "" I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back ."" kind of guy . ;)"
tr	Sing	I want to take him somewhere where there ' s going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ), good service , and all around a great time . =)
tr	Sing	I ' m looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to ' s .
tr	Sing	A little help is always great . =)
tr	Sing	Thank you or your feed back .
tr	Sing	Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
tr	Sing	"Go to a local market or drug store , and buy this month ' s copy of the "" Philadelphia Magazine ""."
tr	Sing	It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
tr	Sing	It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
tr	Sing	Wishing your husband a happy birthday !
tr	Sing	If you ' re looking for a good burger , some great fries ( they are too die for !), and good drinks , go to Chickie & Pete ' s !
tr	Sing	If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you won ' t regret it :)
tr	Sing	How to start a new fish tank ?
tr	Sing	I ' m getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
tr	Sing	I ' m still a beginner .
tr	Sing	Thanks .
tr	Sing	When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that is floating on top .
tr	Sing	You add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
tr	Sing	Start up your filter ( sponge filters are the best for bettas ) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
tr	Sing	If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home .
tr	Sing	Add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
tr	Sing	Make sure the temperature is good .
tr	Sing	Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank .
tr	Sing	Everything else should be good .
tr	Sing	Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another .
tr	Sing	Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang ?
tr	Sing	I would like to learn how
tr	Sing	I see youre still recovering from the accident .
tr	Sing	You appear to be feeling better though .
tr	Sing	That ' s good . :)
tr	Sing	Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang .
tr	Sing	The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on .
tr	Sing	You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions .
tr	Sing	This rail is used for multi purposes , such as laser devices or flashlight devices .
tr	Sing	Prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang .
tr	Sing	You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang .
tr	Sing	Flip the switch and adjust your laser sight according to the directions in the owner manual that comes with the laser sight .
tr	Sing	3 weeks old baby budgie alone at night ?
tr	Sing	I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
tr	Sing	I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
tr	Sing	He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
tr	Sing	I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
tr	Sing	She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
tr	Sing	What is the problem ?
tr	Sing	Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
tr	Sing	I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he / she sleeps .
tr	Sing	When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can ' t produce milk .
tr	Sing	It ' s fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
tr	Sing	If the baby is feathered yet - which I ' m sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
tr	Sing	Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby .
tr	Sing	Ignore the answer above me , btw ! ^ _ ^
tr	Sing	Can I text from Canada to the united states ?
tr	Sing	Ok maybe that isn ' t the right question , but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada , can you send texts to another united states number ?
tr	Sing	And do you get charged for it ?
tr	Sing	Im sorry if I couldn ' t say the question right .
tr	Sing	I hope somebody understands what I mean
tr	Sing	If your ( US ) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company , you texts and calls will go through .
tr	Sing	The only way to know for sure is to call 611 , or your cell phone help line , and ask .
tr	Sing	Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
tr	Sing	Ye $ you can Text in CANADA to the U $ on a U $ number .

tr	Sing	Hi , i bought my Syrian Hamster ( Fernando ) just yesterday and as i was told to leave
tr	Sing	him to get to know his new home .
tr	Sing	As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now .

tr	Sing	Please help im worried about him !!!
tr	Sing	Thanks .

tr	Sing	Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
tr	Sing	Once he is more comfy with his surroundings , then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more .
tr	Sing	But just give him time for now .
tr	Sing	Is Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
tr	Sing	My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years .
tr	Sing	So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
tr	Sing	Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
tr	Sing	I ' d be happy if someone helps , especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)
tr	Sing	I LIVE THERE !
tr	Sing	... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
tr	Sing	I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
tr	Sing	Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains !
tr	Sing	... Fishing , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things you can do for fun .
tr	Sing	So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but its quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
tr	Sing	please let me know if you need anything else
tr	Sing	Visited Fujairah when in Dubai .
tr	Sing	Nothing like Dubai , and never will be !
tr	Sing	Don ' t know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn ' t want to end up like them !
tr	Sing	Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
tr	Sing	I don ' t know should i buy PS3 or X - BOX Kinect .
tr	Sing	Or even N - DS or PSP .
tr	Sing	I ' m a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
tr	Sing	( Same for N - DS and PSP )
tr	Sing	Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year .
tr	Sing	Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works .
tr	Sing	No matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
tr	Sing	I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
tr	Sing	Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
tr	Sing	I don ' t know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don ' t see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
tr	Sing	Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don ' t plan on making another one for a while .
tr	Sing	I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don ' t know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
tr	Sing	What is the typical lifespan of a cat ?
tr	Sing	My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill .
tr	Sing	In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
tr	Sing	I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
tr	Sing	My cat is 18 years old .
tr	Sing	In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live ?
tr	Sing	Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I ' ve ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional .
tr	Sing	According to a couple sources , the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon , England who reportedly live to the age of 36 .
tr	Sing	I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
tr	Sing	Anything after 12 is a bonus .
tr	Sing	Gaining and loosing my cockatiel ' s trust ...?
tr	Sing	I thought that I had gained my cockatiel ' s trust , but now he ' s not coming to me when I open his cage .
tr	Sing	What do I do ?
tr	Sing	Did anything happen before losing his trust ?
tr	Sing	A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you .
tr	Sing	"Eating by his cage and keeping a "" sleep cage "" in your room is a good idea ."
tr	Sing	Keep his cage open and go on your computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
tr	Sing	Let him go at his own pace , don ' t rush with him , and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird .
tr	Sing	This with ruin your bond , and you probably won ' t have another chance to build one .
tr	Sing	Patience is the key . =)
tr	Sing	he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
tr	Sing	But then again he could be !
tr	Sing	dat bird is smart .
tr	Sing	the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage , and birds don ' t usually like cages .
tr	Sing	so , I don ' t think the bird don ' t trust you , but still don ' t like the cage .
tr	Sing	How to make a breyer horse stable ?
tr	Sing	Hi im a big fan of breyer horses !
tr	Sing	I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit .
tr	Sing	And I need to know where to buy the materials .
tr	Sing	Please make this as simple as you can for my dad doesnt really not that good .
tr	Sing	NOTE : If i see a answer that i love i will make my best right there and then
tr	Sing	Breyer horse , miniature / model replica
tr	Sing	sketch out floor plan , estimate size , draw front view , side view , and 3d orthographic perspective views ,
tr	Sing	figure out how many stalls you want , then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse ,
tr	Sing	measure size for platform , draw lines and mark sections , measure out wall sections and height ,
tr	Sing	wood can vary from cork wood or balsa wood , or press - board , or plywood , and pre - cut 2by4 or slats , you can check home depot or hardware shops for larger pieces ,
tr	Sing	How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
tr	Sing	I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today .
tr	Sing	He ' s a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
tr	Sing	Almost every day he ' d even wake me up like 5am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
tr	Sing	And when I move it I guess he figures I ' m playing . x . x
tr	Sing	I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
tr	Sing	That seems cruel to me though .
tr	Sing	Any other way ??
tr	Sing	Do you think he ' s teething ?
tr	Sing	It ' s getting out of hand .
tr	Sing	Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
tr	Sing	He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
tr	Sing	He ' d just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
tr	Sing	When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
tr	Sing	he may be teething but i dont think it can be stopped .
tr	Sing	maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
tr	Sing	yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way , hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
tr	Sing	Which rat cage is better ?
tr	Sing	Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
tr	Sing	( Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover ) Which of these two cages is better :
tr	Sing	I cant decide between height or width .
tr	Sing	This one is better for rats .
tr	Sing	You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
tr	Sing	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
tr	Sing	This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats .
tr	Sing	Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
tr	Sing	If you use this cage it ' s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
tr	Sing	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn ' t that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it doesn ' t last very well .
tr	Sing	The First One Is much Better !
tr	Sing	I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
tr	Sing	Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
tr	Sing	is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
tr	Sing	i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
tr	Sing	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
tr	Sing	from my understanding , if its heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
tr	Sing	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well ?
tr	Sing	i use UTH ' s on all of my burrowing snakes .
tr	Sing	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
tr	Sing	i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
tr	Sing	on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
tr	Sing	good luck !
tr	Sing	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
tr	Sing	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
tr	Sing	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
tr	Sing	My bday is Saturday :) and I wanna have breakfast / lunch with my fam .
tr	Sing	I was gonna have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having Having her bridal shower so brunch is it but the only places I know are denny ' s and ihop .

tr	Sing	Question about the sinking of the Titanic ?
tr	Sing	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
tr	Sing	If yes , was Canada involved in this act / law ?
tr	Sing	Sorry , I ' m just very nervous after watching the movie .
tr	Sing	SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ), which is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
tr	Sing	Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
tr	Sing	If you ever go on a cruise ship , you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill ( lifeboat drill ) within 24 hours of sailing .
tr	Sing	SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on .
tr	Sing	Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
tr	Sing	This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
tr	Sing	I don ' t think so
tr	Sing	When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
tr	Sing	I ' ll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
tr	Sing	I ' m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
tr	Sing	How is the night life in Naha ?
tr	Sing	It doesn ' t have to be underground it could be any type of music .
tr	Sing	Thanks
tr	Sing	The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
tr	Sing	Well first you can try speaking Japanese .
tr	Sing	Go to a sumo tournament .
tr	Sing	Eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
tr	Sing	Climb Mount Fuji .
tr	Sing	Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
tr	Sing	The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
tr	Sing	There ' s the market in Naha , which is great .
tr	Sing	Try the local sake too if you can .
tr	Sing	It ' s a special kind .
tr	Sing	I ' m not sure that there ' s much nightlife in Naha .
tr	Sing	It ' s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
tr	Sing	You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
tr	Sing	Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa .
tr	Sing	Naha ' s not a very big city .
tr	Sing	Modern m16 vs Vietnam m16 version ?
tr	Sing	I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model , and in the game it ' s 3 - shot burst .
tr	Sing	My brother said they only had full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
tr	Sing	1 ) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16 ?
tr	Sing	To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
tr	Sing	He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
tr	Sing	As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming .
tr	Sing	Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
tr	Sing	The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
tr	Sing	1 ) modern m16 is alright .
tr	Sing	Vietnam m16 used to clog up and never work .
tr	Sing	No one uses 3 burst .
tr	Sing	you play too much cod ; P
tr	Sing	modern m16 is best
tr	Sing	Planning on going to New Zealand in January .
tr	Sing	Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
tr	Sing	Planning on going to North and South Island .
tr	Sing	Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
tr	Sing	Rotorua is fine .
tr	Sing	I ' m assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , don ' t worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
tr	Sing	As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the don ' t do any damage .
tr	Sing	However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and hasn ' t been cleared away yet .
tr	Sing	I ' m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
tr	Sing	Have fun in New Zealand !!
tr	Sing	( ps . I ' m assuming you ' ll stop off in Wellington , and since its summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
tr	Sing	Just recently discovered them last time I was down there , they ' re very nice ) www . kaffeeeis . co . nz
tr	Sing	In case of an earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and don ' t go outside as possible debris will fall .
tr	Sing	Yes it ' s ok .
tr	Sing	Nothing wrong with rotorua
tr	Sing	Help ?!
tr	Sing	What size horse do i need ?
tr	Sing	thanks
tr	Sing	louise
tr	Sing	I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
tr	Sing	But I would go for the base number of 15hh .
tr	Sing	"It ' s "" tall "" being it ' s bigger than a pony , but it ' s on the small end for a horse ."
tr	Sing	"I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5 ' 11 "" but my horse is about 16 . 2 or 16 . 3hh , TB ."
tr	Sing	"So don ' t be afraid to get something a little bigger than "" perfect "" just in case you hit a growth spurt ."
tr	Sing	A taller horse doesn ' t always mean a horse you can ' t handle .
tr	Sing	Keep that in mind .
tr	Sing	Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
tr	Sing	You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
tr	Sing	If you Don ' t want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
tr	Sing	Anything smaller you will grow out , anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage , especially when riding .
tr	Sing	Hope I helped :)
tr	Sing	Where in the world is Iguazu ?
tr	Sing	Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area .
tr	Sing	The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘ Garganta Del Diablo ’ ( The Devil ’ s Throat ), where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air .
tr	Sing	With the sun shinning down on the spray , creating a rainbow in the foreground , this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
tr	Sing	The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil , which is equally close .
tr	Sing	The bus is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours , although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats .
tr	Sing	The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
tr	Sing	Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .

tr	Sing	"I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal ( apparently this is "" washing down "" your food "") and not ordering wine ."
tr	Sing	You ' ll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
tr	Sing	However , outside Paris everybody is wonderful .
tr	Sing	Nobody likes the Parisians , even then Parisians don ' t like Parisians .
tr	Sing	South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
tr	Sing	It ' s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
tr	Sing	I used to live in London for 6 months and it ' s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I ' ve been to 45 countries in 5 years ).
tr	Sing	Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
tr	Sing	However , if you ' re allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
tr	Sing	I lived there for 8 months .
tr	Sing	If your French is good / moderate , then head to Paris without a doubt .
tr	Sing	I also highly recommend staying with a French family .
tr	Sing	I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .

tr	Sing	Please help with my cats bladder issue ?
tr	Sing	I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
tr	Sing	When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
tr	Sing	Recently she has been peeing A LOT .
tr	Sing	I ' m talking soaking all the litter box and then some .
tr	Sing	She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath .
tr	Sing	I don ' t have the money to take her to a vet right now but it ' s getting to be an issue .
tr	Sing	I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
tr	Sing	What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first ?
tr	Sing	I love her and want to help her but I don ' t know when I ' ll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
tr	Sing	First of all , I am very sorry to hear you ' re having this issue with your cat . :(
tr	Sing	Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
tr	Sing	If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
tr	Sing	But your cat is passing a LOT of urine , and this is bad .
tr	Sing	Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney , I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease , which untreated can lead to possible renal failure .
tr	Sing	Vomiting , bad breath , and listlessness .
tr	Sing	I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
tr	Sing	In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .

tr	Sing	What is Italian High Renaissance ?
tr	Sing	Have a look at this , it may help .
tr	Sing	1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .
tr	Sing	The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .
tr	Sing	The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ rebirth ”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .
tr	Sing	2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .
tr	Sing	The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardos fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de ' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .
tr	Sing	"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann ."
tr	Sing	Hope it helps !
tr	Sing	I ' m American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
tr	Sing	I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
tr	Sing	do you get your visitors visa immediately at the airport ?
tr	Sing	I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitors visa .
tr	Sing	do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
tr	Sing	drug test ?
tr	Sing	blood test ?
tr	Sing	or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
tr	Sing	i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country .
tr	Sing	I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really don ' t have the money for .
tr	Sing	I ' m really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
tr	Sing	An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
tr	Sing	There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that .
tr	Sing	You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
tr	Sing	Above is the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , including passport information .
tr	Sing	It is free .
tr	Sing	I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U . K .
tr	Sing	You should be fine with just a passport , unless you ' re staying longer than six months .
tr	Sing	You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
tr	Sing	I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
tr	Sing	You ' ll have a great time , so no worries there .
tr	Sing	I visited London , Edinburgh , and St . Andrews so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
tr	Sing	Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you ' ll be fine .
tr	Sing	That tactic never failed me .
tr	Sing	What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
tr	Sing	i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
tr	Sing	if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks ?
tr	Sing	A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred * mutt * chicken .
tr	Sing	You don ' t say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can ' t say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
tr	Sing	However , I can say what features they would / could have .
tr	Sing	Feather Type .
tr	Sing	All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
tr	Sing	Skin Color : Silkies have black skin color , which is dominate .
tr	Sing	Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies .
tr	Sing	Crest : Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene .
tr	Sing	Comb Type : Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) single is also there , but is recessive .
tr	Sing	So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .

tr	Sing	I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 .
tr	Sing	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Sing	http :// i . imgur . com / S2MD2 . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / T2zff . jpg http :// i . imgur . com / Xytex . jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 ( see links above ).
tr	Sing	What do you think of these photos ?
tr	Sing	The lighting was not the best , but the pics turned out ok in my opinion .
tr	Sing	deleting a question where you dont like the answer won ' t get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
tr	Sing	you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
tr	Sing	[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
tr	Sing	lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
tr	Sing	clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it ' s NOT his gf
tr	Sing	For example :
tr	Sing	In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
tr	Sing	In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a corner of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord .
tr	Sing	In the shot from the back , the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
tr	Sing	Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I dont think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
tr	Sing	I do like the shadow , though .
tr	Sing	My suggestion is to pay close attention to what ' s going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
tr	Sing	Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements .
tr	Sing	I ' ve had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I didn ' t notice at first .
tr	Sing	As far ask I ’ m aware our most unique custom would be the “ Country Wake ”.
tr	Sing	After a person dies , their remains are “ waked ” in their home for roughly 2 - 3days .
tr	Sing	In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
tr	Sing	The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .
tr	Sing	But only really in the countryside .
tr	Sing	The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
tr	Sing	The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
tr	Sing	I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
tr	Sing	The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one .
tr	Sing	Barn brack and the ring .
tr	Sing	christmas cake for christmas day .
tr	Sing	I ' m unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn ' t react to seeing another cat on TV .
tr	Sing	I heard that a company ( here is a link : http :// news . yahoo . com / nestl - purina - releases - commercial - aimed - dogs - 183443091 . html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans can ' t hear .
tr	Sing	As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
tr	Sing	If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
tr	Sing	I wouldn ' t know -- I don ' t particularly like scary movies , and I haven ' t tried this with my pet .
tr	Sing	Although , I don ' t think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they ' ll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
tr	Sing	So what about T . V .?
tr	Sing	Well , T . V . is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture .
tr	Sing	To a dog , watching T . V . is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80Hz .
tr	Sing	Hearing is a dog ’ s secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
tr	Sing	im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
tr	Sing	How much should I be looking at for horse transportation ?
tr	Sing	I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
tr	Sing	The place where I ' m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
tr	Sing	So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
tr	Sing	I saw a site that charges $ 0 . 70 per mile .
tr	Sing	Is that reasonable ?
tr	Sing	Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver ' s time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
tr	Sing	Remember that you get what you pay for .
tr	Sing	I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
tr	Sing	He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
tr	Sing	Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
tr	Sing	I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
tr	Sing	See link below .
tr	Sing	Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
tr	Sing	I want to take a cruise around the world .
tr	Sing	I mean literally around the world if possible .
tr	Sing	First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
tr	Sing	Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to ?
tr	Sing	But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere .
tr	Sing	1 . Here ' s a site that lists world cruises including prices .
tr	Sing	2 . Short of chartering your own ship and crew , I don ' t see any way you could customize your own itinerary .
tr	Sing	Good luck !
tr	Sing	No possibility to customise ports of call .
tr	Sing	Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i . e Transatlantic to London ( England ), England to Barcelona ( Spain ), Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ), Egypt to India via Suez canal etc .
tr	Sing	so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40K at least .
tr	Sing	and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
tr	Sing	Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
tr	Sing	There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China , there were lots of Japanese who ' d been displaced during WWII .
tr	Sing	The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
tr	Sing	The Mission was basically latin - american .
tr	Sing	So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that ' s because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that ' s who the photographers took pictures of .
tr	Sing	Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
tr	Sing	You never saw black MUNI drivers , Asian police , Latino politicians until then .
tr	Sing	It was an evolution .
tr	Sing	San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers .
tr	Sing	There has always been a Mexican - American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico .
tr	Sing	San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically .
tr	Sing	EDIT : My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time .
tr	Sing	I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
tr	Sing	There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
tr	Sing	However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
tr	Sing	( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
tr	Sing	My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
tr	Sing	I just wanna make sure :) Thank !
tr	Sing	From my experience Hens ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc .
tr	Sing	You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , don ' t put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
tr	Sing	Good luck !
tr	Sing	yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
tr	Sing	melting brass did not work ?
tr	Sing	what am I doing wrong
tr	Sing	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Sing	I ' ll just echo both other answers .
tr	Sing	Molten brass is damn hot and usually it ' s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
tr	Sing	Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
tr	Sing	It ' s really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
tr	Sing	Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
tr	Sing	I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
tr	Sing	Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Sing	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e . g . for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ).
tr	Sing	I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and doesn ' t get hot enough .
tr	Sing	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ).
tr	Sing	I melt brass and cast it http :// www . mikegigi . com / castgobl . htm
tr	Sing	Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
tr	Sing	You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
tr	Sing	I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http :// www . mikegigi . com / meltmetl . htm and http :// www . mikegigi . com / firehole . htm
tr	Sing	Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
tr	Sing	Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
tr	Sing	Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
tr	Sing	Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch .
tr	Sing	Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
tr	Sing	I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
tr	Sing	When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
tr	Sing	I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which weren ' t a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
tr	Sing	I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
tr	Sing	When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you don ' t like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ).
tr	Sing	Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
tr	Sing	It will become EU law in a couple of years .
tr	Sing	If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
tr	Sing	When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
tr	Sing	She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
tr	Sing	I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I ' m 14 by the way
tr	Sing	Lay some knowledge on them dude .
tr	Sing	Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can ' t pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it .
tr	Sing	Once you ' ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
tr	Sing	Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
tr	Sing	My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .
tr	Sing	Good luck !
tr	Sing	My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
tr	Sing	Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
tr	Sing	2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
tr	Sing	4 . Play the sympathy card .
tr	Sing	"If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they ' re moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into "" giving it a good home "" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet ."
tr	Sing	On the fear angle -- talk her into coming to the pet store with you .
tr	Sing	Once you ' re there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
tr	Sing	Once you ' re holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
tr	Sing	My Snake ' s meal is TOO big , what can I do ?
tr	Sing	Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ).
tr	Sing	Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
tr	Sing	But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
tr	Sing	I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
tr	Sing	So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
tr	Sing	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
tr	Sing	I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
tr	Sing	Best answer shall receive points :)
tr	Sing	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i dont know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
tr	Sing	"Ok so if youre snake will take pre - killed , you can "" gas it ""."
tr	Sing	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
tr	Sing	If it won ' t take pre - killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
tr	Sing	I don ' t like that option though - I think it ' s pretty cruel and I ' d not done properly you ' ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
tr	Sing	I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane .
tr	Sing	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
tr	Sing	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
tr	Sing	Good luck !
tr	Sing	Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen / thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run .
tr	Sing	My opinion - take it for what it ' s worth … :-)
tr	Sing	Looking to move to Toronto ?
tr	Sing	I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
tr	Sing	Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock .
tr	Sing	Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine .
tr	Sing	You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
tr	Sing	"It is full of gay friendly "" everything ""."
tr	Sing	But , you could live where ever you fancy takes you .
tr	Sing	Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
tr	Sing	Start your process here , if you haven ' t already .
tr	Sing	( Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn ' t count for at least two years .)
tr	Sing	Coming to stay , and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD .
tr	Sing	"Just ' wanting to come to Canada "" is NOT enough ."
tr	Sing	You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
tr	Sing	YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history , combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record , and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration .
tr	Sing	It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
tr	Sing	IF you have NOT begun the Application process ' s NOW < you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada .
tr	Sing	Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
tr	Sing	You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
tr	Sing	"Being an American and from the "" south "" you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud ."
tr	Sing	Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .

tr	Sing	How to train my puppy ?
tr	Sing	I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
tr	Sing	Recently I ' m having trouble training him .
tr	Sing	He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
tr	Sing	And he is not following me when I was walking .
tr	Sing	I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it didn ' t help .
tr	Sing	Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
tr	Sing	And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , doesn ' t listen to me .
tr	Sing	He is really excited about anybody he see .
tr	Sing	How to prevent this ?
tr	Sing	Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he can ' t , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
tr	Sing	Anyone have any suggestion ?
tr	Sing	thank you very much .
tr	Sing	Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
tr	Sing	You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
tr	Sing	This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
tr	Sing	This way , he cannot reach the leash to chew it .
tr	Sing	"When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk ."
tr	Sing	Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
tr	Sing	Patience is the key here .
tr	Sing	He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
tr	Sing	And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold .
tr	Sing	Never train out of fear .
tr	Sing	You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
tr	Sing	Good luck with your puppy !
tr	Sing	Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
tr	Sing	why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
tr	Sing	or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
tr	Sing	try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
tr	Sing	or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
tr	Sing	What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs500 per night ?
tr	Sing	I ' m looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
tr	Sing	This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
tr	Sing	Thanks in advance for sharing your experience !
tr	Sing	Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
tr	Sing	In Delhi I ' d recommend Ajay Guesthouse .
tr	Sing	Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice .
tr	Sing	Must say , in Delhi it ' s hard to get good price / quality rating .
tr	Sing	I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
tr	Sing	It ' s in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
tr	Sing	But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
tr	Sing	In Varanasi I don ' t know .
tr	Sing	I ' ve stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
tr	Sing	In Agra I ' ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
tr	Sing	It was nice and close to the Taj .
tr	Sing	It was quite easy to find something .
tr	Sing	( Dont stay in Agra too long .
tr	Sing	One night is enough !)
tr	Sing	There were many hotels there .
tr	Sing	Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
tr	Sing	Good luck , enjoy your time !
tr	Sing	You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
tr	Sing	To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn is best to stay in delhi .
tr	Sing	it is in karol bagh .
tr	Sing	TO Stay in Agra - Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you .
tr	Sing	it is centrally situated .
tr	Sing	To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel is you choice ...
tr	Sing	which one out of these makes the best pet ?
tr	Sing	a degu , a rat , a mouse , a hamster or a guinea pig ?
tr	Sing	and why is the one a better pet ?
tr	Sing	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Sing	I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
tr	Sing	The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
tr	Sing	So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
tr	Sing	Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
tr	Sing	Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
tr	Sing	I ' ve had experience with all of those pets except Degus .
tr	Sing	My favorite would have to be the rat .
tr	Sing	"Mine learned to "" go to the bathroom "" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch ."
tr	Sing	The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
tr	Sing	That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
tr	Sing	My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine wasn ' t ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
tr	Sing	I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
tr	Sing	I ' ve never met a hamster that didn ' t bite me .
tr	Sing	Never had / handled a Degu .
tr	Sing	Get a guinea pig .
tr	Sing	You have to have two because they don ' t do well alone .
tr	Sing	Make certain you get two females .
tr	Sing	If you keep the cage clean they don ' t smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
tr	Sing	Need Advice !?
tr	Sing	I wanted to volunteer and help animals , and decided to try fostering kittens .
tr	Sing	This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wits end .
tr	Sing	I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
tr	Sing	I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
tr	Sing	My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
tr	Sing	That ' s kind of the way it goes .. lol .
tr	Sing	If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
tr	Sing	Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
tr	Sing	For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
tr	Sing	To some degree you can / should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately .
tr	Sing	But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ' ll be interacting with the kittens .
tr	Sing	Then take care of yourself .
tr	Sing	Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
tr	Sing	Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
tr	Sing	If you still don ' t enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
tr	Sing	I find the adults are much easier .
tr	Sing	Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back !
tr	Sing	And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
tr	Sing	Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
tr	Sing	It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
tr	Sing	The birth registration was done right in hospital .
tr	Sing	My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ....
tr	Sing	I didn ' t know that I didn ' t register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
tr	Sing	Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
tr	Sing	I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they don ' t have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
tr	Sing	If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , its simple to do it over the computer .
tr	Sing	For $ 56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
tr	Sing	This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
tr	Sing	You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
tr	Sing	None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .
tr	Sing	You can probably do it all on - line .
tr	Sing	Start here if you were born in Ontario .
tr	Sing	If you were born elsewhere , start here .
tr	Sing	Good luck
tr	Sing	It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
tr	Sing	I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
tr	Sing	When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital .
tr	Sing	As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
tr	Sing	Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
tr	Sing	Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise ?
tr	Sing	ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD * BOTH * !!
tr	Sing	i want to know which you liked better and WHY ?
tr	Sing	include which one had :
tr	Sing	- better food
tr	Sing	- AND JUST MORE STUFF YOU LIKED OVERALL
tr	Sing	please specify which royal or carnival ship (:
tr	Sing	Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best .
tr	Sing	Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St . Thomas , the Bahamas and St . Martin / St . Maarten .
tr	Sing	The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
tr	Sing	The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ).
tr	Sing	Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
tr	Sing	If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
tr	Sing	Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Sing	Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
tr	Sing	If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
tr	Sing	Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
tr	Sing	Usually you can ' t go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
tr	Sing	Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas .
tr	Sing	Look on their website rssc . com
tr	Sing	Royal Caribbean .
tr	Sing	Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
tr	Sing	I really want to travel when I leave school !
tr	Sing	Where in the states could I go ?
tr	Sing	Where in Europe ?
tr	Sing	Have you every traveled before ?
tr	Sing	How long should I go for to each place ?
tr	Sing	( I Have 1 year before collage !)
tr	Sing	& Also how much money would I need ?
tr	Sing	So I can start saving now hehe
tr	Sing	Thanks :)
tr	Sing	I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
tr	Sing	Leave High School ?
tr	Sing	Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you ' ve never traveled before and you don ' t put where you would be traveling from .
tr	Sing	What do you like to do ?
tr	Sing	Southern charm of Nashville , Birmingham , New Orleans or Charlotte .
tr	Sing	Europe ?
tr	Sing	Do you speak a foreign language ?
tr	Sing	I could spend a year in Spain alone .
tr	Sing	From Madrid to Seville to Barcelona an Valencia .
tr	Sing	Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica .
tr	Sing	A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland .
tr	Sing	I ' ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
tr	Sing	Amount of time could be dependent on so many things .
tr	Sing	Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
tr	Sing	Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
tr	Sing	You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
tr	Sing	Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ' ll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you ' re there .
tr	Sing	1 year before collage or college ?
tr	Sing	Good luck .
tr	Sing	I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
tr	Sing	You can ' t beat the price for what you get .
tr	Sing	come to Africa .
tr	Sing	Nigeria , a lovely country .
tr	Sing	But where in nigeria ?
tr	Sing	Obudu cattle ranch .
tr	Sing	More than a tourist centre .
tr	Sing	How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
tr	Sing	Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
tr	Sing	you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
tr	Sing	territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
tr	Sing	you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
tr	Sing	then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
tr	Sing	you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
tr	Sing	the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ), but others will work just as well .
tr	Sing	close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
tr	Sing	he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
tr	Sing	he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
tr	Sing	he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else ' s territory when he is in a new house .
tr	Sing	in a week ' s time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
tr	Sing	let him out for half an hour , to explore .
tr	Sing	then put him back in .
tr	Sing	he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .
tr	Sing	extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
tr	Sing	soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
tr	Sing	remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
tr	Sing	remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
tr	Sing	he might even start peeing on things in fear .
tr	Sing	good luck with your new house and with his new territory !
tr	Sing	Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
tr	Sing	In time though she / he will adjust . :)
tr	Sing	I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
tr	Sing	Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
tr	Sing	I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
tr	Sing	My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
tr	Sing	I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wont work .
tr	Sing	He wont even get close to the crate .
tr	Sing	If I come towards him , he will run away .
tr	Sing	How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
tr	Sing	and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command .
tr	Sing	He wont do anything on command .
tr	Sing	Its very frustrating .
tr	Sing	I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
tr	Sing	I trained her myself .
tr	Sing	She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wont get it until I give her the command .
tr	Sing	I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog .
tr	Sing	She tosses me around like its nothing !
tr	Sing	... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
tr	Sing	Is there any tricks I could use ?
tr	Sing	Maybe get a book on training .
tr	Sing	You have to be in command at all times .
tr	Sing	I would start with a leash .
tr	Sing	Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
tr	Sing	Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
tr	Sing	Later do it again .
tr	Sing	When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
tr	Sing	Put something fun inside .
tr	Sing	Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason .
tr	Sing	Do not shut the door .
tr	Sing	Let him walk in and out for a few days .
tr	Sing	At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
tr	Sing	Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
tr	Sing	If you push it , it will never work .
tr	Sing	With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
tr	Sing	He will learn to really like this .
tr	Sing	Potty outside will come at some point .
tr	Sing	Have patience with him , you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home .
tr	Sing	where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
tr	Sing	will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
tr	Sing	I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
tr	Sing	Should I just settle and book on line ?
tr	Sing	or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
tr	Sing	Thank you !
tr	Sing	If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
tr	Sing	I have taken this tour and it was great .
tr	Sing	I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
tr	Sing	I don ' t remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
tr	Sing	Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
tr	Sing	And no , I do not work for them . :)
tr	Sing	I am just a satisfied customer .
tr	Sing	And don ' t expect to party on this tour .
tr	Sing	Oh , if you are confused .
tr	Sing	Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe .
tr	Sing	It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tr	Sing	tele # 84838389593
tr	Sing	have fun .
tr	Sing	There isn ' t much to see in the delta , it ' s a lifestyle not a resort area .
tr	Sing	If you ' re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
tr	Sing	You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
tr	Sing	The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
tr	Sing	PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken ' s hotel .
tr	Sing	It ' s called Kiwi Heaven and it ' s across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
tr	Sing	It ' s a little hard to get to by foot , they ' re rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
tr	Sing	He ' s an ex - pat from New Zealand and he ' s been in town for awhile .
tr	Sing	He ' ll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
tr	Sing	Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
tr	Sing	Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
tr	Sing	yoga and horses .....?
tr	Sing	I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss ' s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
tr	Sing	I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
tr	Sing	I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
tr	Sing	Because I don ' t feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
tr	Sing	I also have back problems that transfer into my legs .
tr	Sing	"I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think its called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back ."
tr	Sing	Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
tr	Sing	When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
tr	Sing	Then the same thing with the other leg .
tr	Sing	Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
tr	Sing	Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
tr	Sing	I ' ll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
tr	Sing	If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
tr	Sing	Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
tr	Sing	All this will help you use both legs evenly , keep proper contact and use your wight correctly , to keep your leg in a good position .
tr	Sing	BTW you dont want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
tr	Sing	When I first started doing it I ' d do it every day .
tr	Sing	Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
tr	Sing	Now not only is my leg better , but my back is relaxing .
tr	Sing	what are you having problems with ?
tr	Sing	i wouldn ' t bother with yoga i ' d practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , theres also a way to ride on your knees ?
tr	Sing	that help alot with your thigh muscles ( bareback though )
tr	Sing	ya i really wouldn ' t bother with the yoga
tr	Sing	maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i ' ve thought about getting one .
tr	Sing	with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it ' s forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
tr	Sing	You don ' t want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
tr	Sing	I really can ' t help you .
tr	Sing	What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis ?
tr	Sing	My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
tr	Sing	He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight .
tr	Sing	I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water .
tr	Sing	I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
tr	Sing	No pancreatitis or anything abnormal .
tr	Sing	The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
tr	Sing	So my question is ..
tr	Sing	Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
tr	Sing	I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it .. what should i do ?
tr	Sing	i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
tr	Sing	... Some help would be great .
tr	Sing	thank you :)
tr	Sing	I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
tr	Sing	I will give them and call and see what they say .
tr	Sing	Thank you for the help .
tr	Sing	Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
tr	Sing	Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
tr	Sing	I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated .
tr	Sing	1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
tr	Sing	However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
tr	Sing	He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
tr	Sing	Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays )?
tr	Sing	2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn ' t think it would be helpful .
tr	Sing	3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
tr	Sing	It could be due to nausea or any number of things .
tr	Sing	He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ).
tr	Sing	From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .
tr	Sing	And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just doesn ' t feel good .
tr	Sing	4 ) Call your vet .
tr	Sing	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
tr	Sing	You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about .
tr	Sing	No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can .
tr	Sing	You need to ask your vet these questions .
tr	Sing	Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast .
tr	Sing	Bland food .
tr	Sing	My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
tr	Sing	I don ' t know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
tr	Sing	You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
tr	Sing	French dating etiquette ?
tr	Sing	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
tr	Sing	Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc ..'
tr	Sing	However , I ' ve read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
tr	Sing	In addition , from my understanding one - on - one dates is something that comes much later and not ' straight - away ' like us anglo - saxons .
tr	Sing	Is it true ?
tr	Sing	I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
tr	Sing	She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
tr	Sing	She is also nicer when we are both alone .
tr	Sing	However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
tr	Sing	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
tr	Sing	My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along .
tr	Sing	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
tr	Sing	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
tr	Sing	"You are not French for a start , so the "" rules "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
tr	Sing	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
tr	Sing	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
tr	Sing	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
tr	Sing	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
tr	Sing	""" Non !"" means "" non "", not "" I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case ."""
tr	Sing	Christiane gave you a good answer .
tr	Sing	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
tr	Sing	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there ' s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
tr	Sing	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she doesn ' t want to go further .
tr	Sing	If she is nicer when you are alone I ' d say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
tr	Sing	You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
tr	Sing	Unfair for the girl as boys don ' t have that kind of handicap , but that ' s the way our own rules work .
tr	Sing	Should have done research before you left .
tr	Sing	True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
tr	Sing	I ' m just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
tr	Sing	Is there a future for our nation ' s youth ?
tr	Sing	@ Ryan B ,
tr	Sing	I ' m two years into an undergraduate degree .
tr	Sing	Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
tr	Sing	Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas , to Australia , etc .
tr	Sing	There ' s obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc .)
tr	Sing	Your answer doesn ' t do anything but remind me that I ' m going to be $ 25 , 000 in debt by the time I ' m 22 .
tr	Sing	So , thanks .
tr	Sing	@ W . a . b . b . y ,
tr	Sing	I really like you ' re answer .
tr	Sing	it ' s very logical .
tr	Sing	I ' ve also considered becoming a teacher , but it ' s not a job I ' m cut out for .
tr	Sing	I also wish I ' d applied for a scholarship .
tr	Sing	I didn ' t think I ' d be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
tr	Sing	Obviously I ' m still completely stupid though .
tr	Sing	I mean , I wasn ' t smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
tr	Sing	And yes , I am being melodramatic .
tr	Sing	@ Hatmanone ,
tr	Sing	* gasps * So I wouldn ' t make a good prostitute ?
tr	Sing	Are you saying I ' m bad in bed ?
tr	Sing	Your answer is very sweet , but I ' m not compassionate towards teenage high school students .
tr	Sing	In my opinion , far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees .
tr	Sing	I ' m studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I ' m done .
tr	Sing	I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I ' ll be employable .
tr	Sing	I ' ve also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
tr	Sing	I also know that you don ' t get paid that much more in Australia than you do here .
tr	Sing	And it ' s not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
tr	Sing	Try living in Sydney on a teacher ' s salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
tr	Sing	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
tr	Sing	It ' s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
tr	Sing	At the moment there ' s no interest , but that ' ll probably change .
tr	Sing	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they ' ll force you cough up .
tr	Sing	And all that time you ' re overseas you ' ll be racking up interest .
tr	Sing	I wouldn ' t like not having the option to return to NZ .
tr	Sing	I guess I ' m extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree .
tr	Sing	But I worked hard and I ' m still working hard .
tr	Sing	Get an education !
tr	Sing	I ' m doing fine .
tr	Sing	It depends on what you hunger for .
tr	Sing	That means making yourself known ; that means networking .
tr	Sing	why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
tr	Sing	i have a baby eastern king snake .
tr	Sing	i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
tr	Sing	he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
tr	Sing	as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
tr	Sing	according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
tr	Sing	he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
tr	Sing	( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won ' t eat .)
tr	Sing	he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn ' t ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down .)
tr	Sing	i handle him every few days .
tr	Sing	he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
tr	Sing	i just love him to death .
tr	Sing	i don ' t know why he won ' t eat though !
tr	Sing	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
tr	Sing	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
tr	Sing	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won ' t touch the pinky .
tr	Sing	he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
tr	Sing	he doesn ' t seem to know that they are food .
tr	Sing	"i have tried "" braining "" both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he doesn ' t care ."
tr	Sing	i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
tr	Sing	i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake ' s face .
tr	Sing	he wont even try to bite .
tr	Sing	i am very discouraged and sad and i don ' t know what to do .
tr	Sing	he hasn ' t eaten in an entire month .
tr	Sing	i ' ve only tried to feed him one at a time .
tr	Sing	he ' s just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
tr	Sing	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
tr	Sing	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
tr	Sing	If he doesn ' t seem interested in them at all I would say he ' s just not hungry .
tr	Sing	My boyfriend has one and when she ' s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
tr	Sing	In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
tr	Sing	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
tr	Sing	Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
tr	Sing	Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding .
tr	Sing	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
tr	Sing	Its body will be dull looking , too .
tr	Sing	For example , some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall .
tr	Sing	It ' s natural and so long as you don ' t see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
tr	Sing	You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
tr	Sing	hope this helped .
tr	Sing	That ' s why it ' s good to have a python !
tr	Sing	It ' s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
tr	Sing	how rough is too rough ?
tr	Sing	i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
tr	Sing	the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
tr	Sing	the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ).
tr	Sing	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
tr	Sing	were they roughhouse playing ?
tr	Sing	"he has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time ."
tr	Sing	you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
tr	Sing	you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
tr	Sing	giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
tr	Sing	right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
tr	Sing	put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
tr	Sing	then let her out for ten minutes .
tr	Sing	make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
tr	Sing	this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
tr	Sing	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn ' t now .
tr	Sing	she knows she is invading someone else ' s territory , but can ' t help it , and has no where to go .
tr	Sing	she will be able to sleep without being afraid .
tr	Sing	as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
tr	Sing	when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
tr	Sing	the territory thing will be solved .
tr	Sing	your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
tr	Sing	this is not good .
tr	Sing	you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
tr	Sing	that will help to reassure him , and he will be less aggressive with her .
tr	Sing	hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .
tr	Sing	if that happens , separate them , and give them time apart .
tr	Sing	putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .
tr	Sing	good luck !
tr	Sing	"A hiss is basically a "" get the f * ck away "" sound ."
tr	Sing	It means they ' ve gone too far .
tr	Sing	When they start bleeding that means they ' re really fighting .
tr	Sing	I have two cats , and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
tr	Sing	The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
tr	Sing	That means they are fighting .
tr	Sing	When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing .
tr	Sing	I can see how you get confused though . :)
tr	Sing	What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?
tr	Sing	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
tr	Sing	He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ).
tr	Sing	He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
tr	Sing	This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
tr	Sing	Thing is , it worked .
tr	Sing	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ).
tr	Sing	However , Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases .
tr	Sing	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
tr	Sing	THAT WAS THE PLAN .
tr	Sing	What happened ?
tr	Sing	The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked .
tr	Sing	The government did NOT fall .
tr	Sing	TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT ….
tr	Sing	Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
tr	Sing	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
tr	Sing	But Johnson was so obtuse he didn ’ t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
tr	Sing	Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
tr	Sing	In the end Nixon kept his promise for “… peace with honor ….”
tr	Sing	But that ’ s another question .
tr	Sing	To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
tr	Sing	To make the war unpalatable to the American public .
tr	Sing	Before Tet , the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA .
tr	Sing	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
tr	Sing	There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
tr	Sing	Try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
tr	Sing	Bearded dragon question ...?
tr	Sing	I just bought a baby one yesterday .
tr	Sing	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
tr	Sing	"My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the "" sun rays "" he needs ?"
tr	Sing	I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
tr	Sing	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
tr	Sing	He ' s getting used to his new home , but hasn ' t eatin yet .
tr	Sing	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
tr	Sing	Any advice would be greatly appreciated .
tr	Sing	Thank you for your time .
tr	Sing	"Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "" light ,"" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
tr	Sing	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that ' s the easy one to provide for .
tr	Sing	UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
tr	Sing	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
tr	Sing	"So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "" the sun ' s rays "" that your bearded needs ."
tr	Sing	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
tr	Sing	The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they don ' t have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
tr	Sing	UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .
tr	Sing	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
tr	Sing	Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
tr	Sing	Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .
tr	Sing	I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly :
tr	Sing	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i ' m concerned .
tr	Sing	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
tr	Sing	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
tr	Sing	That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
tr	Sing	"Yes , it gives him the "" sun rays "" necessary , that ' s what UVA is ."
tr	Sing	And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
tr	Sing	As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
tr	Sing	I tell all my customers they can try it , but don ' t count on it .
tr	Sing	Best of luck !
tr	Sing	Is a finch or a parakeet better ?
tr	Sing	I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
tr	Sing	Please help me !
tr	Sing	oh and please say y one is better thx !!!!!!
tr	Sing	Please choose the parakeet ...
tr	Sing	Heres my reason .....
tr	Sing	I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
tr	Sing	I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
tr	Sing	At first it was all cool and all .
tr	Sing	After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
tr	Sing	Ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed .
tr	Sing	I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
tr	Sing	I still have them and they are doing well .
tr	Sing	A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
tr	Sing	I love them .
tr	Sing	I tamed them in 4 days .
tr	Sing	The whole family loves them .
tr	Sing	My parents even plays with them .
tr	Sing	They are a big part of our family .
tr	Sing	I hope this helps you with your decision .
tr	Sing	They are both about the same noise level .
tr	Sing	When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
tr	Sing	( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ).
tr	Sing	Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
tr	Sing	the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .
tr	Sing	( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
tr	Sing	If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
tr	Sing	The girl has either pink or brown .
tr	Sing	I would recommend that you get two parakeets .
tr	Sing	But get either one male and one female , or two males .
tr	Sing	I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
tr	Sing	If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
tr	Sing	However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
tr	Sing	My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
tr	Sing	It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
tr	Sing	1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
tr	Sing	2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .
tr	Sing	I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
tr	Sing	Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
tr	Sing	( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
tr	Sing	This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them .
tr	Sing	Do this for about one hour .
tr	Sing	3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .
tr	Sing	( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food )....
tr	Sing	Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .
tr	Sing	Push you finger to their feet gently and say up .
tr	Sing	( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
tr	Sing	4 ) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying .
tr	Sing	You have patience .
tr	Sing	After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
tr	Sing	and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
tr	Sing	Good luck !
tr	Sing	And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
tr	Sing	a parakeet is friendlier
tr	Sing	Parakeet .
tr	Sing	I have a parakeet named Cookie . : P
tr	Sing	When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
tr	Sing	My sister and I would like to go to Ireland .
tr	Sing	I graduate in the spring , and so we ' d like to go between then and winter .
tr	Sing	Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?
tr	Sing	One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
tr	Sing	And then there ’ s the rain .
tr	Sing	Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
tr	Sing	County Kerry is the worst affected .
tr	Sing	The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
tr	Sing	The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic ­ ally means that you can ’ t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
tr	Sing	In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won ’ t need to turn on lights until after 10pm .
tr	Sing	It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
tr	Sing	Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid - July – again , it ’ s all part of the uncertainty principle .
tr	Sing	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
tr	Sing	Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
tr	Sing	"As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "" there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes """
tr	Sing	Afraid I cannot be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
tr	Sing	If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
tr	Sing	The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ?).
tr	Sing	It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
tr	Sing	September for example .
tr	Sing	Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
tr	Sing	To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don ' t have a bus or train service .
tr	Sing	You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
tr	Sing	By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
tr	Sing	Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
tr	Sing	Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
tr	Sing	You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
tr	Sing	You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
tr	Sing	Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe .
tr	Sing	Golden Wonder KilliFish Breeding Help ?
tr	Sing	I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish .
tr	Sing	The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long .
tr	Sing	I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday .
tr	Sing	Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies ?
tr	Sing	Thanks in Advance .
tr	Sing	I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
tr	Sing	I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males .
tr	Sing	If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below .
tr	Sing	If you have plants in your tank .
tr	Sing	your lineatus are already spawning .
tr	Sing	( I ' ve even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer !
tr	Sing	If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .
tr	Sing	Checkout the second source .
tr	Sing	I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .
tr	Sing	Use a well rinsed medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non - crumbly styrofoam to float them .
tr	Sing	If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ),& feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
tr	Sing	Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .
tr	Sing	Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .
tr	Sing	You also may need to treat the incubation water .
tr	Sing	The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
tr	Sing	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Sing	Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult ' s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
tr	Sing	If a pair isn ' t leaving eggs ... check the following :
tr	Sing	1 . Is a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the eggs ?
tr	Sing	3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?
tr	Sing	Aplo . lineatus are wide - spread over southern India .
tr	Sing	That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .
tr	Sing	Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .
tr	Sing	Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5 . 8 to 10 . 6 DH should be fine for gardneri .
tr	Sing	A number of minerals are not of much consequence .
tr	Sing	However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo .)
tr	Sing	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
tr	Sing	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
tr	Sing	In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container .
tr	Sing	Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .
tr	Sing	Other will add a drop of Methylene blue .
tr	Sing	If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
tr	Sing	Hope there is useful grist for the mill here .
tr	Sing	Disney cruise line with young ones ?
tr	Sing	I will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds .
tr	Sing	What is the best time of year ?
tr	Sing	Should I get a balcony ?
tr	Sing	Thanks !!!
tr	Sing	It is vacation time .
tr	Sing	What is the best option ?
tr	Sing	Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids , which best suit you can select ?
tr	Sing	Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
tr	Sing	From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more .
tr	Sing	This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
tr	Sing	The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters .
tr	Sing	Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
tr	Sing	Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
tr	Sing	It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
tr	Sing	The ship offers variety of eatables , deliciously made .
tr	Sing	It is really an entertainment for the kids .
tr	Sing	The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
tr	Sing	Also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion .
tr	Sing	To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option .
tr	Sing	You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
tr	Sing	Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
tr	Sing	I would suggest a warmer season , but not Spring Break or early summer .
tr	Sing	You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays .
tr	Sing	Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
tr	Sing	Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
tr	Sing	Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
tr	Sing	Any time would be great .
tr	Sing	My wife and I , in our 60 ' s at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
tr	Sing	The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities .
tr	Sing	There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
tr	Sing	You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
tr	Sing	If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
tr	Sing	The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
tr	Sing	Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife ' s taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
tr	Sing	If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
tr	Sing	but food is always available and it is consistently good .
tr	Sing	I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
tr	Sing	This is about my farrier , girls .
tr	Sing	That ' s why I ' m posting here !
tr	Sing	Help ?
tr	Sing	I posted this in singles and dating too , so I ' ve just copied and pasted .
tr	Sing	Well , I ' ll try to make this short .
tr	Sing	I have known this guy for a long time , but we ' ve never been good friends or anything .
tr	Sing	He is my farrier ( shoes my horses feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
tr	Sing	Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty .
tr	Sing	He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
tr	Sing	""" Well , if you ever just want to see me I ' ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after ."""
tr	Sing	That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
tr	Sing	Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot ( I ' ve never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he ' d come back out and put it in .
tr	Sing	He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
tr	Sing	So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
tr	Sing	Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still hasn ' t called back yet .
tr	Sing	I don ' t know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
tr	Sing	I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it ' s different because I ' m a client and technically that ' s all I am at this point .
tr	Sing	On the other hand though , if I ' m a client he should really of called back by now because you don ' t leave a customer hanging .
tr	Sing	He didn ' t have my number either because this was the first time I ' ve called HIM instead of his dad .
tr	Sing	It ' s a father and son business .
tr	Sing	Anyway , I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all .
tr	Sing	Thank you for reading if you did ! :)
tr	Sing	Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
tr	Sing	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
tr	Sing	"The reason he said he didn ' t put that nail in was because he "" didn ' t want to risk it "" with my horse ' s horrible feet ."
tr	Sing	This is about the fourth time they ' ve done my horse ' s feet because I just switched back to them .
tr	Sing	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
tr	Sing	However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that ' s what I call a crap farrier ).
tr	Sing	Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
tr	Sing	So , obviously I switched back to these guys .
tr	Sing	Ok , calm down , it ' s not like he ' s some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
tr	Sing	I ' ve known the guy for about 10 years .
tr	Sing	I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
tr	Sing	He is a few years older than me .
tr	Sing	And yes , I do like him .
tr	Sing	To answer Barry White , yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he ' s waiting for .
tr	Sing	On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I ' m busy right now , I ' ll call you when I can come out .
tr	Sing	And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
tr	Sing	I ' ve never done that before though either .
tr	Sing	He will call you back Im sure !
tr	Sing	Sounds like He really likes you ..
tr	Sing	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
tr	Sing	would You like going for * coffee * with him ?
tr	Sing	or is he Not your type ?
tr	Sing	Or are you undecided ?
tr	Sing	If i were you I would Go ...
tr	Sing	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
tr	Sing	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
tr	Sing	Edit ... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing ..
tr	Sing	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
tr	Sing	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
tr	Sing	When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby ..( for those who don ' t Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
tr	Sing	sorta wonder what it would have been like ?
tr	Sing	But That was Years ago .
tr	Sing	He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
tr	Sing	Well one day he said to me You know i don ' t wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
tr	Sing	Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn ' t see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
tr	Sing	I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
tr	Sing	that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
tr	Sing	But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
tr	Sing	I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
tr	Sing	Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don ’ t leave a message so you don ’ t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
tr	Sing	From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he ' s doing a really shitty job .
tr	Sing	Cute or not , I ' d call a different bloke because he ' s doing a sub - par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he ' s flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
tr	Sing	This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
tr	Sing	EPM , Anyone Dealt with it ?
tr	Sing	Might be something different ?
tr	Sing	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
tr	Sing	He ' s not lame , but he ' s been having issues .
tr	Sing	Here ' s what the owner has said :
tr	Sing	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
tr	Sing	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
tr	Sing	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
tr	Sing	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ).
tr	Sing	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
tr	Sing	Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .
tr	Sing	He can eat all his feed and doesn ' t drop any , but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
tr	Sing	He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .
tr	Sing	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
tr	Sing	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
tr	Sing	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
tr	Sing	NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .
tr	Sing	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
tr	Sing	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
tr	Sing	So I might get the horse and see what I can do .
tr	Sing	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
tr	Sing	Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well .
tr	Sing	I ' ll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....
tr	Sing	Think I should do it ?
tr	Sing	Arby ,
tr	Sing	Horse is out of state and not local .
tr	Sing	Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .
tr	Sing	I will be calling my vet and chiro about him .
tr	Sing	Worse comes to worse , I ' m out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
tr	Sing	He ' s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
tr	Sing	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
tr	Sing	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
tr	Sing	She is the one that can ' t afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn ' t recover fully .
tr	Sing	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can ' t eat regular hay .
tr	Sing	I don ' t think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
tr	Sing	I am not going to go pick up a horse I can ' t afford .
tr	Sing	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
tr	Sing	The owner is the one who is unable .
tr	Sing	I will also be having my other vet up who ' s a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
tr	Sing	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
tr	Sing	He ' s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn ' t be related ).
tr	Sing	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Sing	He ' s not starving .
tr	Sing	He ' s dropping we
tr	Sing	The horse is not in pain .
tr	Sing	He ' s not starving .
tr	Sing	He ' s dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days .
tr	Sing	He ' s not putting it back on .
tr	Sing	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
tr	Sing	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
tr	Sing	I know this is going to be expensive .
tr	Sing	I ' m willing to give it a shot .
tr	Sing	Gallop , I ' ve already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .
tr	Sing	Looked at studies , treatment options and such .
tr	Sing	I will have the EPM test done before treating .
tr	Sing	The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
tr	Sing	If that is the case then acupuncture isn ' t going to hurt him .
tr	Sing	It ' s actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
tr	Sing	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
tr	Sing	I do think some Y ! A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can ' t comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
tr	Sing	Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .
tr	Sing	Is that something you are up for ?
tr	Sing	If so go for it and I ' ll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .
tr	Sing	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
tr	Sing	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
tr	Sing	As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we ' ve had to deal with it .
tr	Sing	Pretty much every large stable has here .
tr	Sing	Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
tr	Sing	That horse returned to racing and we didn ' t notice much difference .
tr	Sing	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven ' t had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
tr	Sing	I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .
tr	Sing	One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM .
tr	Sing	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
tr	Sing	I don ' t know .
tr	Sing	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
tr	Sing	You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study .
tr	Sing	I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM .
tr	Sing	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be sometime before those results are released .
tr	Sing	Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?
tr	Sing	West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn ' t always include a fever .
tr	Sing	You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I don ' t think I could take in a horse right now these issues .
tr	Sing	Personally I think you should just keep on walking by .
tr	Sing	You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .
tr	Sing	If you have a good repoire ( which I ' m sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
tr	Sing	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
tr	Sing	So all in all , put the money up front before taking on this horse .
tr	Sing	A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .
tr	Sing	Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy ?
tr	Sing	Or a difficult birth ?
tr	Sing	Was it always like this ?
tr	Sing	Or has it occurred since birth .
tr	Sing	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
tr	Sing	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
tr	Sing	Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
tr	Sing	Extremely bad customer service
tr	Sing	Do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get your hair straightened .
tr	Sing	Great Doc
tr	Sing	Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor .
tr	Sing	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
tr	Sing	My neck is fixed !.
tr	Sing	He knows what hes doing .

tr	Sing	It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
tr	Sing	It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others .
tr	Sing	I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carried out the electrical work ), they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor .
tr	Sing	For example , I actually forgot to feed my cat , and they went out of their way to take care of him .
tr	Sing	Definitely recommend !
tr	Sing	I would have had to because with the economy the way it is i aint haves much monies fo repairs round the House ....
tr	Sing	Comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap .
tr	Sing	and it works !
tr	Sing	Thank you Comfort Zone
tr	Sing	Slowest , Unfriendly Sstaff on Weekends
tr	Sing	I have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line .
tr	Sing	I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A - team or even full - time .
tr	Sing	But this location has the worst weekend staff I ' ve seen EVER .
tr	Sing	Skip te rest - this is the best
tr	Sing	Clean , updated room , friendly staff , safe location .
tr	Sing	Staff is super friendly , treat you as a friend .
tr	Sing	Cannot ask for a better experience .
tr	Sing	Will be staying here any and every time I come anywhere near .
tr	Sing	Overall , Joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot .
tr	Sing	I Love Hellada Gallery !
tr	Sing	Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion ( Not Digital ) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
tr	Sing	BAD COFFEE , DONT BOTHER !
tr	Sing	Can ' t you make a decent cup of coffee ?
tr	Sing	You charge SO MUCH , yet you use the same grounds over and over again .
tr	Sing	The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter .
tr	Sing	No amount of sugar and milk can mask it .
tr	Sing	CHANGE THE PROCESS , PPL !
tr	Sing	Home made product
tr	Sing	I sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon .
tr	Sing	I love the people , the product and the service !
tr	Sing	Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time . -
tr	Sing	But furniture like this will truly be around forever .
tr	Sing	The internet here is terrible .
tr	Sing	Like the previous poster said , the com lines are split between the entire building .
tr	Sing	That ' s 3x worse than Qwest DSL ' s lowest speed offering !
tr	Sing	The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice , but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap .
tr	Sing	Moving out as soon as our lease is up .
tr	Sing	Yes my G1 screen is back working .
tr	Sing	But i paid $ 100 .
tr	Sing	Tmobile want to Send of my phone and i didn ' t want to go thru that ...
tr	Sing	Great service .
tr	Sing	I would recommend them to anyone ..
tr	Sing	Great out night !
tr	Sing	Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu , although popcorn is a nice touch !
tr	Sing	Their food and sweets are awesome .
tr	Sing	But service is very poor .
tr	Sing	Attitude of staff very bad .
tr	Sing	Never gives a receipt .
tr	Sing	Sometimes even gives wrong dish .
tr	Sing	So confused at the payment area .
tr	Sing	Line up is so stupid .
tr	Sing	Even if you line up .
tr	Sing	To make a order you may have to go to back of line .
tr	Sing	Hair By Nivine in eastgardens fixed my hair after i had my hair cut and colored at another salon i felt more confident and the girls are fantastic and ive been going there now for 2 years always happy and they care about my hair had my hair done for my wedding it looked fabolous !
tr	Sing	Best food in northeast
tr	Sing	Theres a reason why Frank mcclelland was named best chef of the north east reigon .
tr	Sing	Food here is absolutely superb .
tr	Sing	Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly .
tr	Sing	The waiting staff is beyond impeccable ( they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom ).
tr	Sing	If you want great food then L ' espalier is the place to go .
tr	Sing	I didn ' t end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
tr	Sing	Before you buy ANYTHING in NY , make sure you stop by Jack - s first .
tr	Sing	Their selection is random , so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store .
tr	Sing	I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances .
tr	Sing	Trust me , you go there once and you - ll always go back !
tr	Sing	First Time Ballerina
tr	Sing	My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time .
tr	Sing	I ' ma soccer mom so I wasn ' t sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear .
tr	Sing	The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina .
tr	Sing	The service at Instep was great !!
tr	Sing	I would recommend them to anyone !
tr	Sing	Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price !
tr	Sing	This place is top notch and highly affordable !
tr	Sing	I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer .
tr	Sing	I ' ve also sent over a number of friends to use the services here and everyone is extraordinarily pleased !
tr	Sing	Thanks for doing such great work on my important pieces of clothing that always look great !
tr	Sing	Tried Crust on Broad on 3 occasions .
tr	Sing	Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time !
tr	Sing	Tonight , I called several times with no answer ( Btwn 5 : 30 and 6 pm ) and finally drove there to place my order in person .
tr	Sing	There was not a customer to be found .
tr	Sing	Great help !
tr	Sing	From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
tr	Sing	I have nothing bad to say .
tr	Sing	No Customer Service
tr	Sing	Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales persons attention .
tr	Sing	It wasn ' t until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you .
tr	Sing	do NOT bring your car here
tr	Sing	I got a coupon from Pennysaver for this station .
tr	Sing	I ended up paying much more .
tr	Sing	Are you kidding me ?
tr	Sing	I don ' t get it .
tr	Sing	Spongy and sweet bread ( microwaved ?), heartless salsa , tiny dogs ...
tr	Sing	You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt .
tr	Sing	The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude .
tr	Sing	If this is the best that Tucson has to offer , I am outta here ...
tr	Sing	I called on a Friday at 12 : 30 complaining of a severe toothache .
tr	Sing	Dr . Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday .
tr	Sing	I had been a patient of Dr . Olbina for 9 years and had spent thousands of dollars on crowns etc .
tr	Sing	Don ' t go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry .
tr	Sing	Good location
tr	Sing	For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
tr	Sing	What you get is a $ 13 / day charge to access the internet through a slow 512 / 512kb / s that you can only use to check email etc ( Read : No downloading ).
tr	Sing	Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
tr	Sing	Make You Feel Like a Number
tr	Sing	You NEVER get a human on the phone .
tr	Sing	It ' s impossible to get an appointment .
tr	Sing	And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient .
tr	Sing	Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt , friendly and informative service .
tr	Sing	No spraying of pesticides !
tr	Sing	Reasonable rate .
tr	Sing	He knows his bees !
tr	Sing	Suzanne , Vancouver
tr	Sing	We were in Springfield , IL for a family funeral from Kansas City .
tr	Sing	This is a nice place , and I know we will return to meet my sister - in - law from Chicago !!
tr	Sing	GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE !!
tr	Sing	Deb Watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great !!!
tr	Sing	She continues to help me when needed even if I have a service question .
tr	Sing	Since I ' m usually at work late Deb has stayed around to help me out when needed .
tr	Sing	This was after I brought the car !!!!!
tr	Sing	Service does not get any better !!!!
tr	Sing	Hidden Gem in Alpharetta
tr	Sing	It ' s the best meal for the money you will find in all of metro Atlanta .
tr	Sing	Le petit is the best place to get your nails done !
tr	Sing	It is very clean , staff is friendly , and I have never waited !
tr	Sing	I go every other week for the shallac / gel manicure which is only $ 25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks !
tr	Sing	I love it .
tr	Sing	Try this place out !
tr	Sing	I promise you will not be disappointed !
tr	Sing	Rendy is totally amazing .
tr	Sing	She gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable .
tr	Sing	She was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures , not only of me , but of my family and friends .
tr	Sing	She is amazing .
tr	Sing	I would recommend her to anyone !
tr	Sing	November 7 , 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience .
tr	Sing	From the delectable Antipasto Misto to the Spaghetti alla Barese and the Parmigiana and ending with gelato , all was mouth watering .
tr	Sing	Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake .
tr	Sing	Maybe next time they will have it .
tr	Sing	Service was excellent !
tr	Sing	Sandy
tr	Sing	Beware of Sharayu
tr	Sing	Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
tr	Sing	Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
tr	Sing	My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont !!!
tr	Sing	Course has come a long way !!
tr	Sing	HCC ' s new nine was a little shaky at first , but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course !!
tr	Sing	The comment below definitely needs to be retracted !
tr	Sing	Come back and give HCC a second chance at least !
tr	Sing	It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive !!
tr	Sing	Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable !
tr	Sing	I have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists , physios , osteos and chiros with no help .
tr	Sing	It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal !
tr	Sing	And now 2 months after my last appointment I am better than ever .
tr	Sing	Thanks guys !
tr	Sing	My husband and I happened in on a whim .
tr	Sing	Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic .
tr	Sing	My husband has been a professional chef , so he is a good judge of quality food .
tr	Sing	This was a flavorful , enjoyable meal for both of us .
tr	Sing	went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake !
tr	Sing	she didnt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it !
tr	Sing	i wont go back !
tr	Sing	she needs to develop a personality !
tr	Sing	brought dog home and its all choppy now !
tr	Sing	It ' s helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting .
tr	Sing	If you watch a lot of fights ( youtube ) and research some of the history ( http :// en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bullfighting ) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more !
tr	Sing	Also after seeing a handful of bullfights , I can say that they ' re a lot more enjoyable if you ' re smashed ( BAC >= . 15 ).
tr	Sing	All I can say is that I am glad I went in !
tr	Sing	This place is about healing , not making a buck .
tr	Sing	The followup visit is FREE !!
tr	Sing	After going to the hospital and paying ER prices ... there is no way I won ' t be back here !!
tr	Sing	I will be back and telling EVERYONE about this clinic .
tr	Sing	THANK YOU !!
tr	Sing	I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
tr	Sing	Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .
tr	Sing	It was a no brainer really .
tr	Sing	I choose Console Pros and I ' m happy I did .
tr	Sing	This place is bad .
tr	Sing	It ' s dark , dingy & dirty .
tr	Sing	"This place may have been something sometime ; but it way past it "" sell by date ""."
tr	Sing	I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it .
tr	Sing	Top range of bike , cheap prices , excellent a +++

tr	Sing	thanks guys goes really well and thaks 4 the cheap price ..
tr	Sing	Hams on Friendly ... RIP
tr	Sing	This is the original Ham ' s restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80 ' s -- but this one is no more .
tr	Sing	Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management .
tr	Sing	I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
tr	Sing	So long Hams ... you will be missed .
tr	Sing	If you have some problems with your windows , you should call them .
tr	Sing	Great help even near closing time !
tr	Sing	I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers !
tr	Sing	I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
tr	Sing	I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
tr	Sing	Thanks Run on !
tr	Sing	This is a perfect place to get your hair done .
tr	Sing	I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut .
tr	Sing	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
tr	Sing	Highly Recommend
tr	Sing	I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed .
tr	Sing	No matter what state I am in when I arrive , I always leave feeling better .
tr	Sing	She has not only helped me through some challenging computer - work and sports related injuries , she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend her .
tr	Sing	Best Store In Boothbay Harbor
tr	Sing	What a fantastic store , I love this place .
tr	Sing	Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
tr	Sing	Dr . Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
tr	Sing	Dr . Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .
tr	Sing	She is and excellent doctor to have on one ' s team .
tr	Sing	Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST !
tr	Sing	My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re - wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
tr	Sing	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
tr	Sing	He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
tr	Sing	I will reccommend his services however / whenever possible !
tr	Sing	I ' ve had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers .
tr	Sing	I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
tr	Sing	Already I ' m considering future projects , and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing .
tr	Sing	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
tr	Sing	I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
tr	Sing	I hope they get there act together ...
tr	Sing	I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see ??
tr	Sing	I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS .
tr	Sing	PLEASE DON ' T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DON ' T WANT TO : CRY , HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE .
tr	Sing	I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
tr	Sing	Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice !
tr	Sing	"Beats having one "" cleaning lady "" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "" maids "" did !"
tr	Sing	This place has the best baby and childrens clothes .
tr	Sing	Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just cant find in a lot of stores .
tr	Sing	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
tr	Sing	I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
tr	Sing	Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it .
tr	Sing	Great place for Antique Lighting !
tr	Sing	I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
tr	Sing	I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago .
tr	Sing	I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago
tr	Sing	Great Food Awesome food Awesome service
tr	Sing	I wanted to try someplace new again .
tr	Sing	This place rocked .
tr	Sing	Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good ..
tr	Sing	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
tr	Sing	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
tr	Sing	I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
tr	Sing	I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
tr	Sing	I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like its getting infected .
tr	Sing	No way .
tr	Sing	I ' m certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong .
tr	Sing	Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
tr	Sing	Not good , not great , and again another disappointment in Central Iowa .
tr	Sing	This town needs some food soul and this is not it .
tr	Sing	Worth Every Penny
tr	Sing	My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
tr	Sing	Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection , and was presented perfectly .
tr	Sing	The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
tr	Sing	I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
tr	Sing	BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER !!!
tr	Sing	It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Sing	All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
tr	Sing	The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
tr	Sing	Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
tr	Sing	Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
tr	Sing	Furnace repair
tr	Sing	Tiger Heating is awesome .
tr	Sing	I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
tr	Sing	John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
tr	Sing	If you need someone to help you out with your heating problems , I DEFINITELY would call TIGER HEATING and AIR .
tr	Sing	Absolutely a wonderful company .
tr	Sing	Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700 .
tr	Sing	After searching high and low for a salesman , I was treated like dirt , and we left .
tr	Sing	Parts department blows , Service department is even worse .
tr	Sing	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
tr	Sing	Nigel from Nidd Design has always provided a first class service , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications .
tr	Sing	Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else .
tr	Sing	He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home !
tr	Sing	Got the crab rangoon which was great , tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good .
tr	Sing	Def going to come back and try this place again .
tr	Sing	Bea was really nice and asked how the food was .
tr	Sing	Cute place also
tr	Sing	As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
tr	Sing	However , I still like this place a lot .
tr	Sing	Esp . the mole , tortilla soup , and guacamole .
tr	Sing	My only complaint is the QUESO .
tr	Sing	It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
tr	Sing	Queso should not be watery :( .....
tr	Sing	*** update *** NEVER MIND !
tr	Sing	Thankyouthankyou
tr	Sing	I had the morelias enchiladas .
tr	Sing	The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good . at all .
tr	Sing	In fact my friend vomited after our meal .
tr	Sing	Service was okay not great , we came for a late lunch .
tr	Sing	I don ' t recommend this place .
tr	Sing	Skylight repair
tr	Sing	My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew .
tr	Sing	James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
tr	Sing	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
tr	Sing	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
tr	Sing	When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tr	Sing	tricky short guy
tr	Sing	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
tr	Sing	To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New movies not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people who spend $ 30 or more groceries ..
tr	Sing	That did it for me .. no more Raina ' s .
tr	Sing	Besides parking is a pain .. cramped and un - ruly with Kumon Parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees '
tr	Sing	Small Firm with Great Service
tr	Sing	Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
tr	Sing	I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I ' ve had with bigger offices and firms .
tr	Sing	While I hope I don ' t have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I ' ll definitely use this firm again .
tr	Sing	Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
tr	Sing	The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
tr	Sing	Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery .
tr	Sing	Danny ( Australia )
tr	Sing	I LOVE MY GYM !
tr	Sing	FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily .
tr	Sing	If you are serious about working out in a non - commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be .
tr	Sing	This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body don ' t be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
tr	Sing	This restaurant is over - rated .
tr	Sing	It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
tr	Sing	The service is poor ...
tr	Sing	I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
tr	Sing	The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
tr	Sing	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
tr	Sing	Mixed Tempura ..................... 8 . 25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad .
tr	Sing	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
tr	Sing	I ' m very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .
tr	Sing	Learn from a Cesar Gracie black belt and former ufc fighter !

tr	Sing	Good Pizza at a good price
tr	Sing	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
tr	Sing	The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
tr	Sing	Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
tr	Sing	HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!
tr	Sing	Absolute horrible service from the parts department .
tr	Sing	I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again .
tr	Sing	Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city .
tr	Sing	this is a good place
tr	Sing	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
tr	Sing	I enjoy going there although i ' ve only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
tr	Sing	i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
tr	Sing	A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
tr	Sing	Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
tr	Sing	Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
tr	Sing	The salesperson refused !
tr	Sing	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
tr	Sing	Don ' t waste time , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help their customers there !
tr	Sing	ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES .
tr	Sing	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
tr	Sing	SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
tr	Sing	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
tr	Sing	IF YOU WANT A STEAK , WELL , THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY .
tr	Sing	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
tr	Sing	Eulogic
tr	Sing	Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
tr	Sing	Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food .
tr	Sing	But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
tr	Sing	If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
tr	Sing	Perfect Location plus
tr	Sing	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it ' s been a refreshing change .
tr	Sing	I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
tr	Sing	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I ' ma bit surprised by other comments .
tr	Sing	She ' s very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
tr	Sing	Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
tr	Sing	great service / deals - support this local business
tr	Sing	I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
tr	Sing	One guy is a little surley , but who gives a crap as long as your car ' s work is outstanding .
tr	Sing	Overall - good stuff .
tr	Sing	Another great business bites the dust !
tr	Sing	A bit pricey , so I didn ' t go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
tr	Sing	I ' m assuming they are completely out of business since I can ' t find any contact information .
tr	Sing	I ' m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
tr	Sing	What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you ' re in a small town rather than Baltimore .
tr	Sing	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
tr	Sing	The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
tr	Sing	Don ' t even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
tr	Sing	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
tr	Sing	Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks .
tr	Sing	Service was excellent .
tr	Sing	Food was excellent .
tr	Sing	Wine was excellent .
tr	Sing	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I ' ll definitely order a steak .
tr	Sing	A perfect place for a romantic dinner .
tr	Sing	Re - interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job .
tr	Sing	I ' m really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend them to all of my friends !!!!!
tr	Sing	Great experience - consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder !
tr	Sing	I adopted a 3 . 5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
tr	Sing	The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding .
tr	Sing	If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don ' t forget to check out the shelters !
tr	Sing	My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family !
tr	Sing	Food good , service poor
tr	Sing	No silverware , asked for a spoon for my sons mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon .
tr	Sing	Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got it .
tr	Sing	Had to go the the bus boys station ourselves to get napkins .
tr	Sing	Only one server , too buys talking with others I guess .
tr	Sing	Food was good , but service means a lot to me .
tr	Sing	Dr . Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had .
tr	Sing	You are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
tr	Sing	I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now , However I am glad you are my dentist now .
tr	Sing	Even though you are expensive .
tr	Sing	Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth .
tr	Sing	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
tr	Sing	Con Garage
tr	Sing	I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
tr	Sing	I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car wouldn ' t pass unless I replaced a hose .
tr	Sing	Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
tr	Sing	If you ' re a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
tr	Sing	Rude service
tr	Sing	even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
tr	Sing	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
tr	Sing	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
tr	Sing	What kind of rude service is that ?
tr	Sing	I don ' t want to waste my time with them .
tr	Sing	Manson ?
tr	Sing	Yes , Manson .
tr	Sing	Right near Chelan .
tr	Sing	Aka Nowheresville .
tr	Sing	And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
tr	Sing	A short but wide - ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street .
tr	Sing	Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections .
tr	Sing	A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
tr	Sing	Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices
tr	Sing	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose ' s prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ).
tr	Sing	The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
tr	Sing	A lack of organisation , coupled with the distain for its customers , makes this the worst rental agency I have used .
tr	Sing	AMAZING NIGHT - Great Party Spot !!
tr	Sing	Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
tr	Sing	Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
tr	Sing	Anyway , once that is fixed , this place will be amazing .
tr	Sing	This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs .
tr	Sing	Check out The Willow Lounge , youll be happy !
tr	Sing	But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
tr	Sing	And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
tr	Sing	Don ' t let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !
tr	Sing	Excellent food , fantastic wait staff
tr	Sing	I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser ' s .
tr	Sing	The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend Fraiser ' s for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
tr	Sing	FANTASTIC STORE !!!
tr	Sing	I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
tr	Sing	It ' s located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
tr	Sing	The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories .
tr	Sing	The friendly crew working was great & very helpful .
tr	Sing	This store is what Colorado is all about .
tr	Sing	Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
tr	Sing	It ' s durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
tr	Sing	I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
tr	Sing	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
tr	Sing	I recommend them highly !
tr	Sing	DONT ever go there , not even if your car flips .
tr	Sing	Their service sucks to start off with , people are cruel and ignorant .
tr	Sing	I ' m compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
tr	Sing	DO NOT EVER GO HERE .
tr	Sing	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
tr	Sing	DO NOT go here .. thank you
tr	Sing	I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
tr	Sing	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1 . 5 in the back .
tr	Sing	My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
tr	Sing	This woman should be working in supercuts ... if that .
tr	Sing	This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
tr	Sing	Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
tr	Sing	The worst Burger King restaurant !!!
tr	Sing	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
tr	Sing	This is a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
tr	Sing	I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already .
tr	Sing	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
tr	Sing	Disgusting french fries is very best menu .
tr	Sing	Don ' t go , or you will learn how to waste your money .
tr	Sing	The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
tr	Sing	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
tr	Sing	Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
tr	Sing	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
tr	Sing	Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
tr	Sing	This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
tr	Sing	The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
tr	Sing	It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
tr	Sing	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
tr	Sing	I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
tr	Sing	This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
tr	Sing	I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
tr	Sing	I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
tr	Sing	best quote ever My gate was stuck halfway open so I calledA CLASS Garage Doors Dr Services .
tr	Sing	I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired , I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
tr	Sing	You will be happy at this store !
tr	Sing	Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula .
tr	Sing	The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
tr	Sing	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
tr	Sing	The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
tr	Sing	Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car !
tr	Sing	Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
tr	Sing	I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
tr	Sing	This place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie .
tr	Sing	"I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ..."" the inspection guy isn ' t here today "".... for example ."
tr	Sing	Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection ... but I was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had time to read a chapter in my book .
tr	Sing	As first - time home buyers , my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .
tr	Sing	She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
tr	Sing	Stephanie ' s knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
tr	Sing	Great Barber
tr	Sing	Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick ' s , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
tr	Sing	I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
tr	Sing	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
tr	Sing	"Got some nice "" freshly baked "" fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine ."
tr	Sing	Took a bite , it tasted odd .
tr	Sing	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
tr	Sing	I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
tr	Sing	She also refused to get a manager .
tr	Sing	I left my number , or tried to anyway .
tr	Sing	Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
tr	Sing	I ' ll never go back there again
tr	Sing	For cheap Chinese food , this is the place to go .
tr	Sing	I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .
tr	Sing	Now , I won ' t eat fast food Chinese unless it ' s from this place .
tr	Sing	The best value I ' ve found from a Chinese restaurant .
tr	Sing	I don ' t live in Lake St . Louis anymore , but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous .
tr	Sing	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin ' : sadface :
tr	Sing	Amazing Experience !
tr	Sing	My experience was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa .
tr	Sing	Jana Kueck was nothing but professional .
tr	Sing	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
tr	Sing	Jana made me feel very comfortable .
tr	Sing	Provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing .
tr	Sing	Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
tr	Sing	Equipment is state of the art .
tr	Sing	I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
tr	Sing	Dave is a patient and methodical teacher , who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take .
tr	Sing	Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
tr	Sing	Dave has much to offer .
tr	Sing	~ Jason
tr	Sing	Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done .
tr	Sing	And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
tr	Sing	I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
tr	Sing	I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already !
tr	Sing	My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
tr	Sing	Their customer service was perfect !
tr	Sing	Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted .
tr	Sing	EVEN IN FRANCE !
tr	Sing	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere , amazing food , and great customer service !
tr	Sing	Thank you Roll UP Crepes !
tr	Sing	This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
tr	Sing	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
tr	Sing	Bad service starting from the front desk .
tr	Sing	The best person is the valet .
tr	Sing	Short of that , avoid this place , as a silver Marriott member , this is a disgrace .
tr	Sing	BEST PLACE IN AMES
tr	Sing	I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
tr	Sing	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
tr	Sing	The fitness center was GREAT !
tr	Sing	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
tr	Sing	I would recommend these apartments to anybody !
tr	Sing	I absolutely LOVED living there .
tr	Sing	The Best Service Ever !!
tr	Sing	I have never had better service .
tr	Sing	My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia .
tr	Sing	Everyone was pleasant and very helpful .
tr	Sing	The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
tr	Sing	The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
tr	Sing	I give this dealer an A +!
tr	Sing	I will definitely be bringing my car back for service .
tr	Sing	HEAVEN ON EARTHHHHHHH !!!!
tr	Sing	THIS PLACE IS THE BEST .
tr	Sing	I HATED SUSHI BEFORE BUT NOW I CANT STOP EATTING IT !!!!!!!
tr	Sing	NICE SERVICE , AND EXCELLENT FOOD .
tr	Sing	EVERYTHING IN HERE SEEMS TO AMAZE ME !!!
tr	Sing	THEIR GRILL DISHES ARE OUTTA THIS WORLD AND SUSHI IS JUST FABULOUS !!!!
tr	Sing	I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK .
tr	Sing	JUNO AND OPEN I LOVE YOU GUYS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Sing	[ no homo ] : D
tr	Sing	friendly , fine food
tr	Sing	The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .
tr	Sing	There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .
tr	Sing	The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
tr	Sing	The atmosphere may not be for everyone .
tr	Sing	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ), but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
tr	Sing	Love the soups .
tr	Sing	The New Italian Kid on the Block
tr	Sing	Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood ?
tr	Sing	Only if it is of the quality of That ' s Amore .
tr	Sing	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
tr	Sing	The arancini di riso ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
tr	Sing	Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there ' s the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
tr	Sing	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I ' m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
tr	Sing	Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used .
tr	Sing	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
tr	Sing	A very satisfied new customer !
tr	Sing	As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
tr	Sing	Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
tr	Sing	Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was “ excellent ”.
tr	Sing	The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach !
tr	Sing	Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict .
tr	Sing	T ' s has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
tr	Sing	Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
tr	Sing	If you ' ve been to North County , chances are it ' s in your favorites list already .
tr	Sing	Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
tr	Sing	Great Dude Cut !
tr	Sing	Great service , cool vibe , impeccable style .
tr	Sing	I ' ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
tr	Sing	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
tr	Sing	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it ' s the best look I ' ve ever had .
tr	Sing	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
tr	Sing	Looks like there ' s a lot of talent in this place .
tr	Sing	Worth every penny .
tr	Sing	My Favorite place at Wildwood
tr	Sing	I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
tr	Sing	I rated it 5 stars .
tr	Sing	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
tr	Sing	I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
tr	Sing	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
tr	Sing	When in Scordia , Sicily
tr	Sing	If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia .
tr	Sing	You will also have the pleasure of learning the Italiano language .
tr	Sing	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
tr	Sing	I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
tr	Sing	Luv always ..
tr	Sing	I ' ve never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
tr	Sing	If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired !
tr	Sing	Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives !
tr	Sing	Best Car Dealer in TX
tr	Sing	I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
tr	Sing	The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
tr	Sing	Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
tr	Sing	If you ' re looking to buy a car , definitely give them a call .
tr	Sing	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
tr	Sing	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
tr	Sing	Any ER would be the same .
tr	Sing	As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
tr	Sing	As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
tr	Sing	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
tr	Sing	Wonderful Experience
tr	Sing	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
tr	Sing	Dr . Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
tr	Sing	He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
tr	Sing	Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general , Dr . Taylor was the best !
tr	Sing	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
tr	Sing	I would recommend him to everyone !
tr	Sing	This school is the worst one i ' ve ever been to .
tr	Sing	I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
tr	Sing	There ' s holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
tr	Sing	The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they don ' t listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student ' s ).
tr	Sing	The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
tr	Sing	Excellent customer service and quality work .
tr	Sing	That was 4 years ago .
tr	Sing	I haven ' t been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
tr	Sing	If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
tr	Sing	So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
tr	Sing	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
tr	Sing	It ' s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
tr	Sing	THX :-)
tr	Sing	The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if your looking fot a good game and aren ' ta nerd , dont ask them .
tr	Sing	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
tr	Sing	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn ' ta fps .
tr	Sing	He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
tr	Sing	First and Last time we ' ll eat there
tr	Sing	My friend and I went there for lunch today .
tr	Sing	Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we ' d try it .
tr	Sing	BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
tr	Sing	Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else .
tr	Sing	Liquidweb . com Rocks !!!
tr	Sing	I am not a client of liquidweb . com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
tr	Sing	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
tr	Sing	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
tr	Sing	The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
tr	Sing	I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb . com
tr	Sing	Hino Dealer of the Year

tr	Sing	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
tr	Sing	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you ' ll love Vetri .
tr	Sing	Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I ' ve ever eaten ( and I ' ve eaten a lot ).
tr	Sing	I ' ve dined at lots of high - end restaurants and I ' ve never before felt my money was so well spent .
tr	Sing	I ' ve been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
tr	Sing	The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
tr	Sing	There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you ' d like .
tr	Sing	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
tr	Sing	Top notch , all the way !
tr	Sing	David is amazing
tr	Sing	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
tr	Sing	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
tr	Sing	He was patient and adapted when everything didn ' t go according to schedule on my wedding day .
tr	Sing	He got the pictures back to me quickly .
tr	Sing	I would highly recommend David to anyone .
tr	Sing	He will exceed your expectations !
tr	Sing	He doesn ' t just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won ' t even notice that there ' s a camera there .
tr	Sing	My husband just got a bike there as a gift he ' s only had it a month .
tr	Sing	It ' s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
tr	Sing	But just this week a peddle broke .
tr	Sing	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
tr	Sing	Which was very expensive .
tr	Sing	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
tr	Sing	Trek is not so great
tr	Sing	Only Concerned With Money
tr	Sing	I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
tr	Sing	Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
tr	Sing	It ' s pretty ridiculous !
tr	Sing	Terrible service !!!
tr	Sing	Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
tr	Sing	When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy didn ' t know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
tr	Sing	So what was the point of the appointment !?!
tr	Sing	I will NEVER do business with this company !
tr	Sing	Internet Department is rude and insulting
tr	Sing	"I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "" AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ."
tr	Sing	"I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS "" Wow , can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles ."
tr	Sing	As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
tr	Sing	Stay away from this dealership !!!
tr	Sing	This place is a Rip - Off
tr	Sing	"I brought a car in to have the "" check engine "" light diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
tr	Sing	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
tr	Sing	I did the work myself for $ 50 .
tr	Sing	There ' s no excuse for that kind of estimate .
tr	Sing	My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn ' t want to wait in line at Outback .
tr	Sing	What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
tr	Sing	# 1 its immaculately clean .
tr	Sing	# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
tr	Sing	This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
tr	Sing	TRY THIS PLACE - YOU ' LL LOVE IT .
tr	Sing	Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
tr	Sing	I came in and saw Dr . Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
tr	Sing	I have to tell you that I haven ' t had one and don ' t want one .
tr	Sing	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
tr	Sing	I sent a customer of mine to you .
tr	Sing	Dr . Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
tr	Sing	I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before .
tr	Sing	I can ' t thank you enough .
tr	Sing	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago .
tr	Sing	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates .
tr	Sing	I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .

tr	Sing	It ' s only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
tr	Sing	I can ' t say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
tr	Sing	Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me !!!!
tr	Sing	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
tr	Sing	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
tr	Sing	She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
tr	Sing	You should give her a try - it ' s worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
tr	Sing	Worst Service I ' ve Ever Experienced
tr	Sing	I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there isn ' t .
tr	Sing	1 ) Service and manners were nonexistent .
tr	Sing	( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
tr	Sing	4 ) The business is very unorganized .
tr	Sing	The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
tr	Sing	I ' d recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store .
tr	Sing	Exile is the best !!!
tr	Sing	Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
tr	Sing	I have been shopping there for over six years now .
tr	Sing	The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
tr	Sing	The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
tr	Sing	In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
tr	Sing	Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
tr	Sing	Shop local at Exile !!
tr	Sing	Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that doesn ' t impress me .
tr	Sing	The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
tr	Sing	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
tr	Sing	The angry lobster was completely over - priced !
tr	Sing	$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
tr	Sing	I wouldn ' t go there again .
tr	Sing	Alto delivers on all levels .
tr	Sing	From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
tr	Sing	The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
tr	Sing	Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee !).
tr	Sing	While it ' s not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you ' ll never forget .
tr	Sing	The landlord is not nice nor helpful
tr	Sing	I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
tr	Sing	I love the location and the apartment !!
tr	Sing	I ' ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
tr	Sing	And the exterminator is very nice , also .
tr	Sing	Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that ' s going to be anywhere you go !
tr	Sing	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
tr	Sing	She is a pure b ****!!!
tr	Sing	I know that ' s ugly ... but she won ' t help you out for anything ... sad story .
tr	Sing	Other than that , I would recommend living here . :)
tr	Sing	The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
tr	Sing	The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
tr	Sing	A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
tr	Sing	She may be the reason for all the change .
tr	Sing	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
tr	Sing	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
tr	Sing	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
tr	Sing	He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
tr	Sing	WWW - Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
tr	Sing	I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
tr	Sing	"Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , "" one can see forever "" a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur ."
tr	Sing	I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
tr	Sing	There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
tr	Sing	It would have been more than one could bear !
tr	Sing	Kathy and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection .
tr	Sing	I hope to be back !
tr	Sing	junkie lube ?!
tr	Sing	really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I ' d stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
tr	Sing	"The neon lighting sign still said "" on "" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they ' d be open tomorrow ."
tr	Sing	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
tr	Sing	"grey shirt "" mark "" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing ....."
tr	Sing	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
tr	Sing	It ' s not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
tr	Sing	For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
tr	Sing	Restored my faith in Mechaincs .
tr	Sing	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
tr	Sing	I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal .
tr	Sing	The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
tr	Sing	I cannot say enough about this place .
tr	Sing	Do yourself a favor , call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again ..
tr	Sing	a great vacation !
tr	Sing	Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts .
tr	Sing	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I ' m sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
tr	Sing	OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
tr	Sing	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
tr	Sing	The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
tr	Sing	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
tr	Sing	Holly is truely the best hairstylist !
tr	Sing	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
tr	Sing	I was very pleased with my experience here .
tr	Sing	I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
tr	Sing	She did a great job !
tr	Sing	Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
tr	Sing	My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
tr	Sing	I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
tr	Sing	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
tr	Sing	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
tr	Sing	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don ' t let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
tr	Sing	Great , and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville .
tr	Sing	I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
tr	Sing	So huge in fact , that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references , and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria .
tr	Sing	Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
tr	Sing	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
tr	Sing	Alot .
tr	Sing	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
tr	Sing	The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
tr	Sing	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals .
tr	Sing	This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
tr	Sing	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
tr	Sing	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
tr	Sing	Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation !
tr	Sing	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I ' ve always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
tr	Sing	The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
tr	Sing	the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
tr	Sing	remember to bring cash since they don ' t take debit or credit .
tr	Sing	hope this helps !!
tr	Sing	Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
tr	Sing	I ' m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
tr	Sing	I normally don ' t write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one won ' t be getting my business , nor my family ' s , nor my co - workers .
tr	Sing	It ' s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
tr	Sing	I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
tr	Sing	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
tr	Sing	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
tr	Sing	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
tr	Sing	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member ' s suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
tr	Sing	I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
tr	Sing	I would recommend her highly !
tr	Sing	First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I don ' t care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ).
tr	Sing	That said , I hated this restaurant .
tr	Sing	The service was just about as good as I ' d get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
tr	Sing	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
tr	Sing	Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
tr	Sing	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6 / 4 / 11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
tr	Sing	I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
tr	Sing	Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle .
tr	Sing	"He told me "" no problem , we will match the offer or do better ."""
tr	Sing	Mr . Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
tr	Sing	Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world .
tr	Sing	I urge all St . Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
tr	Sing	Excellent customer service !!!
tr	Sing	Great , Honest Service
tr	Sing	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
tr	Sing	The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
tr	Sing	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
tr	Sing	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
tr	Sing	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
tr	Sing	I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
tr	Sing	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
tr	Sing	Dr . Shady
tr	Sing	Kelly hit the nail on the head .
tr	Sing	""" Dr . Shady "" is a jerk ."
tr	Sing	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
tr	Sing	Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr . Shady .
tr	Sing	You have just lost mine .
tr	Sing	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
tr	Sing	Dr . Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
tr	Sing	She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
tr	Sing	I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
tr	Sing	Poor Experience
tr	Sing	I did not have a good experience w / Dr . Ghassemlou .
tr	Sing	During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I ' ve always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
tr	Sing	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
tr	Sing	I learned more about this doing my own research afterward .
tr	Sing	I think he could ' ve done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
tr	Sing	Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
tr	Sing	It ' s pretty combative actually .
tr	Sing	you ' ll love it
tr	Sing	I have had my back fused in 2 places .
tr	Sing	I wish that I hadn ' t done this .
tr	Sing	Even after my fusions , my back continued to hurt , but now it doesn ' t hurt any more .
tr	Sing	I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr . de Barros .
tr	Sing	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
tr	Sing	Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
tr	Sing	I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
tr	Sing	I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color )!
tr	Sing	"I regularly request Kim ' s business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!!"""
tr	Sing	Quaint , lovely , small salon with BIG personality .
tr	Sing	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
tr	Sing	My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
tr	Sing	I cannot recommend this salon enough !!!
tr	Sing	Thanks Cheveux !
tr	Sing	My Favorite in McLean
tr	Sing	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
tr	Sing	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
tr	Sing	If you cannot park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center ' s garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
tr	Sing	The service is fast .
tr	Sing	Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
tr	Sing	( it ' s by the door , on the hostess stand )
tr	Sing	Horrible Service !
tr	Sing	I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
tr	Sing	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5 : 30 .
tr	Sing	Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
tr	Sing	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
tr	Sing	I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
tr	Sing	I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband ' s funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
tr	Sing	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
tr	Sing	She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
tr	Sing	Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances .
tr	Sing	Great first experience .
tr	Sing	"I ' m 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not "" old "" like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to ."
tr	Sing	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
tr	Sing	She recommended products but absolutely didn ' t pressure me to buy .
tr	Sing	It ' s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
tr	Sing	I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
tr	Sing	Smokers Haven
tr	Sing	Yeah , this complex is not very good .
tr	Sing	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
tr	Sing	If you do not smoke , do not move here .
tr	Sing	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
tr	Sing	I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
tr	Sing	Chicken salad salad is great too .
tr	Sing	Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
tr	Sing	This isn ' ta TGIF or Cafe , its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
tr	Sing	Rate a church ?
tr	Sing	Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light .
tr	Sing	It ' s a bloody church , for chrisssake !
tr	Sing	The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
tr	Sing	He had a robe that was made back in the ' 60s .
tr	Sing	God was pleased with that one !
tr	Sing	It ' s historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
tr	Sing	Stop by at least once or you ' ll go to heck !
tr	Sing	me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
tr	Sing	i ' ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
tr	Sing	the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
tr	Sing	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
tr	Sing	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
tr	Sing	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
tr	Sing	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
tr	Sing	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair .
tr	Sing	I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
tr	Sing	The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
tr	Sing	I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
tr	Sing	Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service .
tr	Sing	Roger M ., Woodinville
tr	Sing	I wouldn ' t send my dogs there .
tr	Sing	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
tr	Sing	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren ' t paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
tr	Sing	Excellent service
tr	Sing	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
tr	Sing	Tiffany is fabulous !
tr	Sing	I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
tr	Sing	She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
tr	Sing	I didn ' t even buy the bag there !
tr	Sing	Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don ' t have what you need .
tr	Sing	The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
tr	Sing	The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
tr	Sing	The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
tr	Sing	Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
tr	Sing	I recommend La Hacienda
tr	Sing	Don ' t know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
tr	Sing	There must be a reason so many people like it there .
tr	Sing	Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that ' ll change my mind .... and a different server .
tr	Sing	i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
tr	Sing	my experience with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
tr	Sing	from start to finish they were top notch .
tr	Sing	i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car .
tr	Sing	This insurance co . Is a joke !!!
tr	Sing	if you don ' t mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
tr	Sing	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
tr	Sing	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F %# king Assh @%$ e !!!
tr	Sing	Fantastic Service !
tr	Sing	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
tr	Sing	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
tr	Sing	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
tr	Sing	Great service , great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT !
tr	Sing	I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need .
tr	Sing	Love my home at Creekside
tr	Sing	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
tr	Sing	The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp . Edwin , are just wonderful .
tr	Sing	I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
tr	Sing	The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe ' s , Whole Foods , and other stores .
tr	Sing	The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
tr	Sing	Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
tr	Sing	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
tr	Sing	"Liberty construction shows up and it ' s two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch "" We ' re the best ... we ' re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we ' re great ""."
tr	Sing	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
tr	Sing	I ' m glad I trusted my gut and didn ' t get sucked into doing business with them .
tr	Sing	Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right .
tr	Sing	Don ' t waste your time or money !
tr	Sing	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
tr	Sing	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
tr	Sing	If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
tr	Sing	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
tr	Sing	( For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me !)
tr	Sing	Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
tr	Sing	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
tr	Sing	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
tr	Sing	My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
tr	Sing	In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
tr	Sing	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
tr	Sing	Pam Gillies
tr	Sing	Best Salsa ( hehehe )
tr	Sing	The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
tr	Sing	No joke !
tr	Sing	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
tr	Sing	Very affordable ( don ' t call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
tr	Sing	And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
tr	Sing	Dr . Mann killed our pet
tr	Sing	Yea , Dr . Mann ain ' t so great .
tr	Sing	If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
tr	Sing	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
tr	Sing	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
tr	Sing	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
tr	Sing	in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
tr	Sing	Gone downhill since change in ownership
tr	Sing	I used to LOVE this place .
tr	Sing	But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
tr	Sing	I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them , they lost my car key .
tr	Sing	Lucky I had a spare with me !
tr	Sing	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
tr	Sing	Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
tr	Sing	However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
tr	Sing	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
tr	Sing	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
tr	Sing	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
tr	Sing	Terrible communication as well .
tr	Sing	Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
tr	Sing	College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE !
tr	Sing	Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
tr	Sing	You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
tr	Sing	You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate !
tr	Sing	Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont .
tr	Sing	Staff is under educated .
tr	Sing	Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
tr	Sing	Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
tr	Sing	This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
tr	Sing	On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
tr	Sing	Don ' t go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
tr	Sing	You won ' t even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
tr	Sing	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
tr	Sing	I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
tr	Sing	Oh , and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas .
tr	Sing	Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
tr	Sing	Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
tr	Sing	I guess you get what you pay for .
tr	Sing	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
tr	Sing	I was thoroughly impressed !
tr	Sing	I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
tr	Sing	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren ' t the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
tr	Sing	The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company ' s were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
tr	Sing	Very nice work and friendly guys too .
tr	Sing	Best money I ' ve spent on remodeling ever .
tr	Sing	I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
tr	Sing	New training Centre is excellent
tr	Sing	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
tr	Sing	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
tr	Sing	It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
tr	Sing	I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre - owned BMW from this dealership .
tr	Sing	The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
tr	Sing	( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
tr	Sing	Very likely it needs a new window seal ).
tr	Sing	I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
tr	Sing	( But this is a certified car from a dealer .)
tr	Sing	So I brought the car back the second day .
tr	Sing	Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
tr	Sing	I walked away .
tr	Sing	So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER .
tr	Sing	Perfect Practice
tr	Sing	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
tr	Sing	The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
tr	Sing	My dental surgeon , Dr . Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
tr	Sing	Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....

tr	Sing	Wonderful service for large group
tr	Sing	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
tr	Sing	It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
tr	Sing	I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
tr	Sing	I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
tr	Sing	I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
tr	Sing	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
tr	Sing	Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
tr	Sing	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
tr	Sing	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
tr	Sing	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
tr	Sing	It wasn ' t completly impossible !!!!
tr	Sing	I am definitely going back
tr	Sing	After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner .
tr	Sing	The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
tr	Sing	The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
tr	Sing	After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
tr	Sing	This was a less than impressive experience at Trio ' s .
tr	Sing	One night was too much .
tr	Sing	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
tr	Sing	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
tr	Sing	"I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "" This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton "" and the receptionist then hung up on me ."
tr	Sing	To warn you to stay away from this place just isn ' t enough .
tr	Sing	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
tr	Sing	Grocery and Daily Needs Store
tr	Sing	Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software .
tr	Sing	Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
tr	Sing	Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time .
tr	Sing	How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
tr	Sing	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
tr	Sing	Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before .
tr	Sing	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
tr	Sing	Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day ' s training
tr	Sing	Over telephone , immediate .
tr	Sing	On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
tr	Sing	This is by far the BEST B & B that we have ever stayed at !
tr	Sing	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
tr	Sing	The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
tr	Sing	Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
tr	Sing	Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
tr	Sing	A & E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
tr	Sing	I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
tr	Sing	The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A & E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A & E does not ).
tr	Sing	Their quote came in at half the price of A & E for the same work and same part .
tr	Sing	Seems to me like A & E charges way more than necessary !
tr	Sing	Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre - screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
tr	Sing	Lovely Nails on Cayuga St . in Lewiston , NY
tr	Sing	First let me start out by saying , that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
tr	Sing	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
tr	Sing	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
tr	Sing	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
tr	Sing	I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
tr	Sing	He did warm it up .
tr	Sing	He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
tr	Sing	If the pedicure lasted 20 mins ., that was a stretch .
tr	Sing	None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
tr	Sing	Good Service - Limited Results
tr	Sing	Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
tr	Sing	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
tr	Sing	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it ' s very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
tr	Sing	The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
tr	Sing	I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
tr	Sing	I know it can take awhile for results and didn ' t expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
tr	Sing	( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...)
tr	Sing	Friendly , clean and excellent location
tr	Sing	The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
tr	Sing	Common room was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . –
tr	Sing	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9 : 30am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
tr	Sing	The location is really stellar !
tr	Sing	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
tr	Sing	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
tr	Sing	Just Autos Thank you !
tr	Sing	Was fast and easy , Just had our car returned this morning , I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure .
tr	Sing	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ).
tr	Sing	So yes , I wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
tr	Sing	I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
tr	Sing	I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
tr	Sing	I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
tr	Sing	After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , its less dry & smoother !
tr	Sing	If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out !
tr	Sing	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
tr	Sing	I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!!!
tr	Sing	Oil Change Disaster
tr	Sing	My wife had taken her ' 07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
tr	Sing	A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
tr	Sing	Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
tr	Sing	There could have ( hopefully doesn ' t have ) major damage to the engine .
tr	Sing	All of this started after their oil change .
tr	Sing	I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
tr	Sing	Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
tr	Sing	I wonder if they were going down a hill !
tr	Sing	I brought it back with 9000 miles .
tr	Sing	I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
tr	Sing	I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever .
tr	Sing	Great Job
tr	Sing	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
tr	Sing	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us .
tr	Sing	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
tr	Sing	I ' m sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
tr	Sing	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
tr	Sing	Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .
tr	Sing	The Peterson Family
tr	Sing	Poor service
tr	Sing	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ', you will see it here .
tr	Sing	There were 3 names before us .
tr	Sing	The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
tr	Sing	This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “ no reservation , sign your name here ”.
tr	Sing	I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
tr	Sing	I could not understand any his reasons .
tr	Sing	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
tr	Sing	My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
tr	Sing	Instructor never showed up !
tr	Sing	"January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday ' s 2 PM class "" Beginning Yoga with Brittany ."""
tr	Sing	The instructor did not show up !
tr	Sing	There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
tr	Sing	Well , not much I can say except I ' m very disappointed with this experience .
tr	Sing	This was our first visit to your studio .
tr	Sing	In today ' s instant world , there ' s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e - mail if she was going to be late .
tr	Sing	As a yoga studio , I ' m sure you ' re all aware that all actions generate karma …
tr	Sing	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
tr	Sing	I beg to differ .
tr	Sing	This place is marginal at best .
tr	Sing	I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
tr	Sing	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5 . 10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
tr	Sing	I don ' t want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I don ' t want to take on something I can ' t handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
tr	Sing	Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber .
tr	Sing	Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !
tr	Sing	I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80 ' s , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960 ' s .
tr	Sing	NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
tr	Sing	I ' m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
tr	Sing	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
tr	Sing	My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
tr	Sing	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
tr	Sing	At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
tr	Sing	I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
tr	Sing	I never felt pain or discomfort .
tr	Sing	The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
tr	Sing	Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
tr	Sing	Rocky M . Lange Retired Coordinator , Clark County School District
tr	Sing	HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
tr	Sing	not only is this place too expensive for what it is , its horrible !
tr	Sing	In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin !), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
tr	Sing	It took over 1 . 5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
tr	Sing	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
tr	Sing	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
tr	Sing	I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here .
tr	Sing	Texas Roadhouse is WAY better !!
tr	Sing	Spay and neuter service .
tr	Sing	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
tr	Sing	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
tr	Sing	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
tr	Sing	Which is so dumb .
tr	Sing	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
tr	Sing	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
tr	Sing	My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
tr	Sing	Then I got a bill for $ 483 . 00 .
tr	Sing	"The doctor ' s office said that payments had been "" reversed ""."
tr	Sing	Blue cross has no record of aa reversal .
tr	Sing	The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC / BS .
tr	Sing	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160 . 00 has come through .
tr	Sing	It was an ingrown toenail .
tr	Sing	How much could it possibly cost ?
tr	Sing	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
tr	Sing	I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
tr	Sing	I also appreciate their honesty .
tr	Sing	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
tr	Sing	I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
tr	Sing	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
tr	Sing	i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
tr	Sing	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
tr	Sing	"Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "" There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck ""."
tr	Sing	Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
tr	Sing	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
tr	Sing	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
tr	Sing	From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gonna take 2 , 000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal ?
tr	Sing	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
tr	Sing	Grimy work you guys do .
tr	Sing	Best Stationery store in Bethesda
tr	Sing	Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
tr	Sing	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell ' s .
tr	Sing	I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
tr	Sing	It ' s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
tr	Sing	"I gave the woman I spoke with today a "" You ' ve been yelped !"" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna ."
tr	Sing	I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
tr	Sing	printing , printing , copies , printing , copies , printing ,
tr	Sing	Watch out for your wallet
tr	Sing	Watch out for your wallet !
tr	Sing	This company is overpriced for their services .
tr	Sing	The craziest part is that they aren ' t even based locally at the city I ' m in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
tr	Sing	I ' ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
tr	Sing	Believe me .
tr	Sing	This is THE premier university in Virginia .
tr	Sing	It is also the largest .
tr	Sing	With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chilis , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
tr	Sing	VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
tr	Sing	VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
tr	Sing	VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
tr	Sing	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
tr	Sing	The U of R is also recommended , too !
tr	Sing	Orr ' s a nightmare !
tr	Sing	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who ' d arrived around 1 : 00 am and were drinking at the springs .
tr	Sing	When we complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any problems ), nothing happened !
tr	Sing	Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
tr	Sing	Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
tr	Sing	Orr is not relaxing , it ' s not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
tr	Sing	To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
tr	Sing	FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
tr	Sing	I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
tr	Sing	Now , of course , there ' s a new building , with presumably better facilities .
tr	Sing	All to the good .
tr	Sing	For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
tr	Sing	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
tr	Sing	Absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
tr	Sing	I ' ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it ' s one of the best lodging experiences I ' ve ever had on the coast ... and I ' m even comparing it to the big resorts I ' ve stayed at !
tr	Sing	There ' s a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
tr	Sing	The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it ' s kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
tr	Sing	I honestly can ' t rave enough about this place ... it ' s really a hidden gem worth checking out !
tr	Sing	My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
tr	Sing	I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
tr	Sing	I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and can ' t stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I ' m in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
tr	Sing	The place is chill and comfortable .
tr	Sing	And their breakfast is awesome !!
tr	Sing	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
tr	Sing	Stop in and have a bite you won ' t regret it .
tr	Sing	A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
tr	Sing	I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
tr	Sing	I ' ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance )...
tr	Sing	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
tr	Sing	I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
tr	Sing	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
tr	Sing	Not what i expected !
tr	Sing	~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
tr	Sing	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape ' s or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention .
tr	Sing	Nice selection , very clean , friendly staff !
tr	Sing	Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
tr	Sing	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
tr	Sing	The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
tr	Sing	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre - made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
tr	Sing	Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting wasn ' t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
tr	Sing	Although I ' ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I ' ll gladly do it knowing that since she ' s been astounding to me once before that she ' ll always be that way !
tr	Sing	( Also she has a really great website !
tr	Sing	She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
tr	Sing	Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
tr	Sing	I am a college student .
tr	Sing	"Before treatment , my food cravings were "" out of control "" which caused me to be stressed out ."
tr	Sing	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 %) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
tr	Sing	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
tr	Sing	I was amazed .
tr	Sing	I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
tr	Sing	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend ' s aunt recommended it .
tr	Sing	It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
tr	Sing	What I like most about Dr . Liau is that she is very caring .
tr	Sing	She talks to you at each appointment .
tr	Sing	I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
tr	Sing	I am SO GLAD to have found Dr . Liau .
tr	Sing	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
tr	Sing	An Asset to Richmond
tr	Sing	For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
tr	Sing	Bowtie has filled that role nicely .
tr	Sing	The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
tr	Sing	The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
tr	Sing	There ' s plenty of parking , and I ' ve never had an issue with audience members who won ' t stop talking or answering their cellphones .
tr	Sing	Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
tr	Sing	But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
tr	Sing	A great cinema in a great location .
tr	Sing	Thank you , Bowtie !
tr	Sing	Craft Wonderland with History
tr	Sing	My first visit was so fun yesterday .
tr	Sing	I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
tr	Sing	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
tr	Sing	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
tr	Sing	The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
tr	Sing	What a history .
tr	Sing	She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
tr	Sing	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
tr	Sing	This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
tr	Sing	By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
tr	Sing	Great name for a great store !
tr	Sing	Barbara Quimba 1 / 30 / 10
tr	Sing	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
tr	Sing	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
tr	Sing	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
tr	Sing	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
tr	Sing	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
tr	Sing	I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier .
tr	Sing	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
tr	Sing	Bait and switch , untrained workers
tr	Sing	"Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a "" dual head concrete grinder "" to remove thinset and make a nice "" finished "" look ( ready for concrete stain )."
tr	Sing	Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
tr	Sing	No problem , sounded like it ' s done every day .
tr	Sing	Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder won ' t leave a finished look AND it ' s $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
tr	Sing	I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
tr	Sing	I feel like they didn ' t tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
tr	Sing	One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry .
tr	Sing	Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it ' s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I ' ve been in .
tr	Sing	I availed myself of the wash ' n fold service , taking just about a year ' s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I ' d originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ).
tr	Sing	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
tr	Sing	Didn ' t hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
tr	Sing	"Whereas my answer to the question "" Where do you get your laundry done ?"" used to be , "" At the checkout line at WalMart ,"" I can honestly say the answer now is , "" At The Laundry Tub ."""
tr	Sing	Thank you !
tr	Sing	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
tr	Sing	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
tr	Sing	I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
tr	Sing	I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
tr	Sing	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
tr	Sing	Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
tr	Sing	Okay , here ' s the scoop .
tr	Sing	I ' ma regular at the HH .
tr	Sing	The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
tr	Sing	I think they ' re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
tr	Sing	In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ).
tr	Sing	In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just doesn ' t care / know better .
tr	Sing	You just have to know what you ' re getting into when you go .
tr	Sing	Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ), and don ' t go if you have a limited amount of time .
tr	Sing	Trust The Midas Touch
tr	Sing	I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
tr	Sing	the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
tr	Sing	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
tr	Sing	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
tr	Sing	Like the girl with the fuse problem ...
tr	Sing	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical !
tr	Sing	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
tr	Sing	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
tr	Sing	When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
tr	Sing	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ).
tr	Sing	The bottom line is that the food isn ' t great and is relatively high - priced .
tr	Sing	The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
tr	Sing	But I ' d go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
tr	Sing	It ' s just not worth it .
tr	Sing	Don ' t Expect Sleep or Courtesy
tr	Sing	I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
tr	Sing	At 3 : 15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
tr	Sing	When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
tr	Sing	I called the front desk and got no answer .
tr	Sing	After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none , I decided to just pack up and leave .
tr	Sing	The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ?).
tr	Sing	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ).
tr	Sing	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
tr	Sing	This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
tr	Sing	Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
tr	Sing	Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT go
tr	Sing	I began seeing Dr . Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
tr	Sing	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
tr	Sing	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it ' s a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ).
tr	Sing	Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr . Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
tr	Sing	Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
tr	Sing	The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
tr	Sing	That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
tr	Sing	And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture .
tr	Sing	So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started .
tr	Sing	Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
tr	Sing	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2pm - 8pm ).
tr	Sing	The only reason I ' m giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
tr	Sing	So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
tr	Sing	One more thing , they don ' t take any credit cards or checks .
tr	Sing	You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
tr	Sing	Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
tr	Sing	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11 : 45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
tr	Sing	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
tr	Sing	Do not live here , you will regret it !
tr	Sing	The Worst Experience Ever !!!
tr	Sing	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
tr	Sing	He was referred to me by a friend , who didn ' t have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
tr	Sing	I figure I would give this company a chance .
tr	Sing	However , after giving a required $ 500 . 00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
tr	Sing	He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
tr	Sing	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
tr	Sing	WHAT IS THAT ?????
tr	Sing	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
tr	Sing	Please everyone .... take heed and don ' t get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget ...
tr	Sing	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
tr	Sing	"When we walked in , the person behind desk said : "" oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something ."""
tr	Sing	"After a good few minutes , he asked : "" what do you want ?"""
tr	Sing	Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
tr	Sing	I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
tr	Sing	"He immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 deposit now !"""
tr	Sing	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
tr	Sing	"When I inquired he rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out you ' ll get it back ."""
tr	Sing	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
tr	Sing	I also mentioned to the reception person .
tr	Sing	"He responded "" we have problem with ' people '""."
tr	Sing	Imagine a hotel having problems with people .
tr	Sing	I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
tr	Sing	He said he ' s had a long and bad day .
tr	Sing	I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
tr	Sing	My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
tr	Sing	Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
tr	Sing	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
tr	Sing	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn ' t budge .
tr	Sing	I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
tr	Sing	I emailed 4 times , never a response .
tr	Sing	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet ' s that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
tr	Sing	I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
tr	Sing	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
tr	Sing	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
tr	Sing	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
tr	Sing	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
tr	Sing	I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
tr	Sing	Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
tr	Sing	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
tr	Sing	I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
tr	Sing	So I ordered a slice .
tr	Sing	It tasted like I just flew back home .
tr	Sing	I dunno how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
tr	Sing	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
tr	Sing	That being said , I don ' t know how their delivery service is .
tr	Sing	Good food , good wait staff , poor management
tr	Sing	The food was good , and so was our waitress .
tr	Sing	When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I ' ve gotten a gift certificate for .)
tr	Sing	I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
tr	Sing	The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
tr	Sing	Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
tr	Sing	Sorry for interrupting I guess .
tr	Sing	The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
tr	Sing	There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
tr	Sing	I will not be visiting Mama Mia ' s again .
tr	Sing	DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
tr	Sing	TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
tr	Sing	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
tr	Sing	ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
tr	Sing	NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD .
tr	Sing	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
tr	Sing	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
tr	Sing	I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
tr	Sing	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
tr	Sing	I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
tr	Sing	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
tr	Sing	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
tr	Sing	IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL .
tr	Sing	BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
tr	Sing	Mezza Luna FTW !
tr	Sing	its like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
tr	Sing	it seems like its healthier too , but its prolly not .
tr	Sing	that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting .
tr	Sing	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
tr	Sing	their pizza was a little salty for me , but its still good .
tr	Sing	anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
tr	Sing	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
tr	Sing	** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , I have had food delivered before .
tr	Sing	This was back between ' 05 and ' 09 and I don ' t remember how many times we ' ve had it delivered .
tr	Sing	My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100 , 000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
tr	Sing	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre - owned 2009 XF .
tr	Sing	Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
tr	Sing	I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
tr	Sing	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
tr	Sing	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
tr	Sing	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
tr	Sing	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
tr	Sing	I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
tr	Sing	That ' s all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
tr	Sing	Thanks for the great deal and the great car !
tr	Sing	Identity Theft
tr	Sing	Myself and my fiance ' s identity was stolen from the office staff .
tr	Sing	It was a black female that use to work in the office .
tr	Sing	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
tr	Sing	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
tr	Sing	Thats how they were caught .
tr	Sing	The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
tr	Sing	Nobody lived there .
tr	Sing	A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
tr	Sing	Short time later the guy would leave , then the girl .
tr	Sing	My apartment was usually quiet .
tr	Sing	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
tr	Sing	It sucked having an SUV .
tr	Sing	If I found a spot , I couldnt fit in it .
tr	Sing	Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
tr	Sing	The best there is in service .
tr	Sing	I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
tr	Sing	It was 4 : 50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
tr	Sing	Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening .
tr	Sing	It ' s without a doubt , the best service experience I ' ve ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville ' s price for putting on the other rear tire .
tr	Sing	I hope I can return the favor in the future !
tr	Sing	Alan Grissom
tr	Sing	Room ok .
tr	Sing	Service and Client base not ok .
tr	Sing	I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
tr	Sing	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non - violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
tr	Sing	I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get .
tr	Sing	I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call .
tr	Sing	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
tr	Sing	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
tr	Sing	"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" you do not order what you do not know about "" and "" you don ' t know how pizza is made ""."
tr	Sing	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
tr	Sing	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
tr	Sing	Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy .
tr	Sing	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn ' t so well - done ( actually , burnt ).
tr	Sing	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
tr	Sing	THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
tr	Sing	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my * ss .
tr	Sing	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
tr	Sing	A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good , right ?
tr	Sing	I mean , that ' s the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
tr	Sing	Well , this may be an exception .
tr	Sing	"The staff taking your order and "" waiting "" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all ."
tr	Sing	I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
tr	Sing	And don ' t even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is , and pardon my French , a jerk .
tr	Sing	"If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are "" ok ,"" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
tr	Sing	Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
tr	Sing	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
tr	Sing	Wish this was in Saratoga --
tr	Sing	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
tr	Sing	She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
tr	Sing	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
tr	Sing	Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
tr	Sing	This chef knows what he is doing .
tr	Sing	Treat yourself and go -- you will go back !
tr	Sing	I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
tr	Sing	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
tr	Sing	Unlike Saratoga .
tr	Sing	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
tr	Sing	- R . Morris .
tr	Sing	I think that there pretty good .
tr	Sing	First of all , if you call for an appointment they won ' t tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
tr	Sing	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I ' m happy that these guys don ' t do those two things in particlular .
tr	Sing	Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
tr	Sing	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that ' s a common misconception ( http :// www . consumerreports . org / health / healthy - living / beauty - personal - care / hair - loss - 10 - 08 / hair - loss . htm ).
tr	Sing	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
tr	Sing	But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
tr	Sing	Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
tr	Sing	If you want miracles you ' ll have to go to 21st St .
tr	Sing	It ' s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it ' s very good .
tr	Sing	First trip to Canada
tr	Sing	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
tr	Sing	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
tr	Sing	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
tr	Sing	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
tr	Sing	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
tr	Sing	From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
tr	Sing	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
tr	Sing	I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
tr	Sing	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
tr	Sing	Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
tr	Sing	Favorite place in Tampa .
tr	Sing	Update : I had to add to my review .
tr	Sing	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
tr	Sing	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
tr	Sing	"Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
tr	Sing	I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
tr	Sing	I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
tr	Sing	It ' s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
tr	Sing	Bottom line is that when it ' s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
tr	Sing	Great work and honest establishment !
tr	Sing	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn ' t seem cost effective anymore .
tr	Sing	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
tr	Sing	I had hear great things about Phet and G & G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
tr	Sing	The service was excellent and personable .
tr	Sing	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
tr	Sing	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car .
tr	Sing	Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
tr	Sing	That is just unheard of these days !
tr	Sing	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
tr	Sing	He is my mechanic going forward !
tr	Sing	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
tr	Sing	1 . Social Media .
tr	Sing	How has it gone so far ?
tr	Sing	Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
tr	Sing	Excellent service and quality
tr	Sing	I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
tr	Sing	The window didn ' t break !
tr	Sing	My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind !).
tr	Sing	I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they weren ' t even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
tr	Sing	Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
tr	Sing	In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
tr	Sing	I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone ' s business !
tr	Sing	Friendly staff , but definitely some problems
tr	Sing	May , 2009 .
tr	Sing	Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1 : 00 am !
tr	Sing	Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
tr	Sing	There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
tr	Sing	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
tr	Sing	A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
tr	Sing	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
tr	Sing	"A mid - afternoon "" fire drill "" was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel ."
tr	Sing	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
tr	Sing	The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
tr	Sing	Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
tr	Sing	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
tr	Sing	My experience was awful though .
tr	Sing	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
tr	Sing	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
tr	Sing	Essentially , I told him I didn ' t trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
tr	Sing	I don ' t know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
tr	Sing	After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
tr	Sing	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
tr	Sing	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which isn ' t true .
tr	Sing	I mean , I don ' t care if he doesn ' t know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there ' s no way I ' m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
tr	Sing	The Worst Chinese I ' ve Ever Had
tr	Sing	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
tr	Sing	The service stunk .
tr	Sing	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone elses .
tr	Sing	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
tr	Sing	Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
tr	Sing	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
tr	Sing	The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
tr	Sing	I will NEVER go here again .
tr	Sing	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
tr	Sing	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
tr	Sing	Terrible Service
tr	Sing	Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
tr	Sing	Nope , none of the above .
tr	Sing	He stood there and told us how he wasn ' t at fault .
tr	Sing	It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
tr	Sing	"At no time during the conversation did the words , "" I ' m sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
tr	Sing	I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
tr	Sing	Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
tr	Sing	Do not use this company !
tr	Sing	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
tr	Sing	I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
tr	Sing	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30 . 00 .
tr	Sing	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
tr	Sing	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
tr	Sing	I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
tr	Sing	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
tr	Sing	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
tr	Sing	I explained I did not get what I paid for .
tr	Sing	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
tr	Sing	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
tr	Sing	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
tr	Sing	With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
tr	Sing	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY .
tr	Sing	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner ' s own unprofessionalism .
tr	Sing	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
tr	Sing	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
tr	Sing	Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun .
tr	Sing	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
tr	Sing	Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away .
tr	Sing	The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
tr	Sing	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
tr	Sing	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club ' s actual OWNER ?!
tr	Sing	Bad for business .
tr	Sing	I was appalled .
tr	Sing	I will never recommend this gym to any woman .
tr	Sing	The equipment and classes aren ' t good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
tr	Sing	The Salon Experience from Hell
tr	Sing	I feel obligated to share this story .
tr	Sing	Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
tr	Sing	Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
tr	Sing	I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don ' t show up , they ' ll charge you .
tr	Sing	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
tr	Sing	"After he already put product on my hair he said "" I should warn you , I ' m expensive ."""
tr	Sing	What was I supposed to do , say I can ' t afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair .
tr	Sing	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
tr	Sing	$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
tr	Sing	Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
tr	Sing	I cried the entire way home .
tr	Sing	"He then "" fixed "" it for free but it still looked like crap ."
tr	Sing	I will never go back .
tr	Sing	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
tr	Sing	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
tr	Sing	That ' s my favorite show of all time .
tr	Sing	I ' m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
tr	Sing	Maybe he didn ' t do a good job and they told him so .
tr	Sing	Absolute Nightmare !
tr	Sing	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
tr	Sing	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
tr	Sing	However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
tr	Sing	I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
tr	Sing	Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
tr	Sing	Well , that was strike one .
tr	Sing	I wasn ' t going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
tr	Sing	However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6 , 000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
tr	Sing	Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
tr	Sing	He said yes .
tr	Sing	Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6 , 000 +, all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you won ' t have to pay a penalty .'
tr	Sing	I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
tr	Sing	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
tr	Sing	The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi - sketchiness .
tr	Sing	Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
tr	Sing	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
tr	Sing	The other person working at the store didn ' t know that I still had this table coming .
tr	Sing	I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
tr	Sing	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
tr	Sing	I waited .
tr	Sing	And waited .
tr	Sing	He never once contacted us .
tr	Sing	I ' ve had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
tr	Sing	He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and didn ' t seem terribly apologetic .
tr	Sing	Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they ' re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you ' ll have to fight to get it resolved .
tr	Sing	Poor Service
tr	Sing	My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
tr	Sing	If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would .
tr	Sing	On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
tr	Sing	After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces .
tr	Sing	I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
tr	Sing	No one will give me a date .
tr	Sing	I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
tr	Sing	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
tr	Sing	How do you lose a drawer .
tr	Sing	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
tr	Sing	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture .
tr	Sing	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
tr	Sing	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone ' s warehouse .
tr	Sing	Excellent Driving School
tr	Sing	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I ' ve been a nervous wreck and haven ' t been behind the wheel .
tr	Sing	Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
tr	Sing	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
tr	Sing	"She highly recommended him and described him as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions ""."
tr	Sing	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
tr	Sing	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
tr	Sing	Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
tr	Sing	My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !
tr	Sing	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn ' t feel comfortable driving an SUV .
tr	Sing	"Gerry pleasantly said "" since I am already here why don ' t we give it shot ."
tr	Sing	I trust you and believe that you ' ll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
tr	Sing	Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself .
tr	Sing	"Don ' t worry , I ' ll take care of you !"""
tr	Sing	....... the rest was history !
tr	Sing	Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
tr	Sing	Gerry , I can ' t thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear .
tr	Sing	"To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !"
tr	Sing	Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
tr	Sing	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
tr	Sing	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
tr	Sing	And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
tr	Sing	Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
tr	Sing	The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
tr	Sing	You don ' t have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
tr	Sing	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You won ' t regret it !!
tr	Sing	Karla Ferguson - Granger
tr	Sing	"PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "" all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and I will tell you that I don ' t know these people except from eating at their restaurant ."
tr	Sing	We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
tr	Sing	So that comment is completely false .
tr	Sing	Dr . Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
tr	Sing	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr . Christopher T . Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
tr	Sing	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
tr	Sing	I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
tr	Sing	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ).
tr	Sing	"He later said that by 2 months he "" meant at least two months ""."
tr	Sing	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
tr	Sing	A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
tr	Sing	He also never even said he was sorry .
tr	Sing	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
tr	Sing	So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ), and he is letting me die .
tr	Sing	I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
tr	Sing	I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
tr	Sing	"Even my PA i went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you ""."
tr	Sing	He said it sarcastically .
tr	Sing	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
tr	Sing	What you can learn from the below ' bad experience '.
tr	Sing	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
tr	Sing	I ' d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they don ' t just take every dog coming in .
tr	Sing	I ' ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
tr	Sing	It ' s unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
tr	Sing	But I ' ve done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I don ' t work here ), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
tr	Sing	It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
tr	Sing	You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
tr	Sing	But not at a risk to other people ' s pets .
tr	Sing	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
tr	Sing	No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so isn ' t it reasonable to think they might know what they ' re doing ?
tr	Sing	I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
tr	Sing	So I say : I ' m at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
tr	Sing	I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I ' m at the Radison - Warwick .
tr	Sing	And he says : You ' re at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
tr	Sing	and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you ' re at a Radison in Warwick thats too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
tr	Sing	I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
tr	Sing	He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I ' m in PHILLY .
tr	Sing	Call dominos in your town .
tr	Sing	I SAY LISTEN : I ' m at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
tr	Sing	He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
tr	Sing	OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
tr	Sing	he says : Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
tr	Sing	He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
tr	Sing	YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
tr	Sing	Yes , I say .
tr	Sing	17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
tr	Sing	You ' re at 7th .
tr	Sing	I am just south of Walnut .
tr	Sing	She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
tr	Sing	YES , I am west of broad .
tr	Sing	Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
tr	Sing	Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we don ' t go past broad ?
tr	Sing	Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno ' s .
tr	Sing	Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
tr	Sing	B & B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
tr	Sing	"Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year !""."
tr	Sing	I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
tr	Sing	"She even went so far as to say "" Your calling about one board ?"""
tr	Sing	Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
tr	Sing	I WAS calling about one board !!
tr	Sing	I ' m very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
tr	Sing	So I figure if they don ' t want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I ' ll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
tr	Sing	YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
tr	Sing	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
tr	Sing	"I called the "" 207 "" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up ."
tr	Sing	I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
tr	Sing	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
tr	Sing	The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
tr	Sing	However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ).
tr	Sing	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M , no exceptions .
tr	Sing	Then she was gone .
tr	Sing	# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
tr	Sing	#) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2PM it ' s a full day charge .
tr	Sing	# 4 ) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM .
tr	Sing	If you go later , it ' s all cleaned up .
tr	Sing	( By whom , I don ' t know .
tr	Sing	I never saw anyone there .
tr	Sing	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
tr	Sing	Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that didn ' t work .
tr	Sing	Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems .
tr	Sing	No tub .
tr	Sing	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
tr	Sing	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
tr	Sing	Free parking .
tr	Sing	I ' d go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I wouldn ' t pay their rack rate .
tr	Sing	"The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "" everyone "" is going to "" love "" the food , decor and service ."
tr	Sing	The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
tr	Sing	It ' s an entirely up and down experience , however .
tr	Sing	Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
tr	Sing	That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
tr	Sing	Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
tr	Sing	The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
tr	Sing	Dessert was ... hmmm , that ' s interesting , I don ' t even remember dessert .
tr	Sing	I guess that tells you a lot .
tr	Sing	Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
tr	Sing	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
tr	Sing	And my -- no , I still don ' t remember what I had .
tr	Sing	Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
tr	Sing	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you ' ve never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
tr	Sing	PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5 : 00 and 9 : 30 were their only openings .
tr	Sing	When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
tr	Sing	MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store .
tr	Sing	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .
tr	Sing	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ).
tr	Sing	So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
tr	Sing	Hmmm ... A person cannot call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ), and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
tr	Sing	I ' m no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
tr	Sing	Whatever type of operation they are running , I ' m not interested and if you ' re smart , you won ' t be either .
tr	Sing	What a waste of TIME .
tr	Sing	Aside from that little * mystery *, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
tr	Sing	"Somehow , since she supposedly doesn ' t know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew "" exactly which dress "" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on ."
tr	Sing	My point : Even if I was wrong , don ' t sit there and argue with the customer .
tr	Sing	"Say something like , "" Huh ."
tr	Sing	"I didn ' t think so but you could be right ."""
tr	Sing	"Unless you want to take the "" tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she ' s obviously not loving "" approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere ."
tr	Sing	Seriously : do not waste your time .
tr	Sing	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn ' t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
tr	Sing	AWFUL SERVICE !
tr	Sing	After happily visiting Sear ' s Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
tr	Sing	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
tr	Sing	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you don ' t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear ' s use ).
tr	Sing	Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
tr	Sing	Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
tr	Sing	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn ' t possible .
tr	Sing	Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
tr	Sing	OK , one bad experience ... fine .
tr	Sing	The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
tr	Sing	I would not have gone back , but I couldn ' t find the particular tire they ' d used in stock anywhere else .
tr	Sing	Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
tr	Sing	I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
tr	Sing	He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
tr	Sing	However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
tr	Sing	So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
tr	Sing	So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
tr	Sing	"A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that "" I "" left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car )."
tr	Sing	Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
tr	Sing	Of course I couldn ' t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ).
tr	Sing	The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
tr	Sing	Of course , they couldn ' t call him either to ask about it because apparently they don ' t keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ), so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ).
tr	Sing	On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
tr	Sing	I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ).
tr	Plur	Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior !
tr	Plur	The cells were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al - Jihad districts of the capital .
tr	Plur	Guerrillas killed an engineer , Asi Ali , from Tikrit .
tr	Plur	They also killed Shaikh Hamid ' Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit .
tr	Plur	Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half .
tr	Plur	Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers .
tr	Plur	Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
tr	Plur	Some 2 , 000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have .
tr	Plur	Baghdadis don ' t venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more , you never know where you might get stuck .
tr	Plur	Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
tr	Plur	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year , which indicates they are the same people .
tr	Plur	Most people haven ' t gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal is ).
tr	Plur	"There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April , and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "" This time we will be the first to loot , we didn ' t get anything the last time ""."
tr	Plur	Mosques are calling for donating blood , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah , most of them returned later though .
tr	Plur	Speaking of Fallujah , we have only Al - Jazeera to rely on for our news from there .
tr	Plur	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al - Sahhaf .
tr	Plur	""" They are targetting ambulances "", "" American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women "", and "" They are using cluster bombs against civilians "" is all you get to hear from him ."
tr	Plur	Over 300 Iraqis are reported dead and 500 wounded in Fallujah alone .
tr	Plur	We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
tr	Plur	Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
tr	Plur	Here are some excerpts :
tr	Plur	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post - accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
tr	Plur	There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl .
tr	Plur	Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions .
tr	Plur	These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl :
tr	Plur	Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray ?
tr	Plur	S . and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
tr	Plur	What do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
tr	Plur	"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen . Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
tr	Plur	They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .
tr	Plur	On the other , restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People ' s Party , who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police .
tr	Plur	Certainly , the Shiites already hate al - Qaeda and would help ; likewise the Kurds .
tr	Plur	The Americans have to put away their free - market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households .
tr	Plur	We need an FDR in Iraq , not a Ronald Reagan .
tr	Plur	Let ' s just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :
tr	Plur	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
tr	Plur	Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
tr	Plur	Have they , however , actually weakened Israeli security ?
tr	Plur	The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements .
tr	Plur	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
tr	Plur	Armed militias , many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience , have proliferated .
tr	Plur	The more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran ' s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
tr	Plur	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
tr	Plur	These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein ' s regime , but have now organized and armed themselves .
tr	Plur	They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
tr	Plur	Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine .
tr	Plur	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post - Saddam Iraq are no exception .
tr	Plur	Israel ' s security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
tr	Plur	Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
tr	Plur	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Plur	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Plur	But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .
tr	Plur	Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .
tr	Plur	But they , too , failed .
tr	Plur	In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .
tr	Plur	However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .
tr	Plur	About 1 , 200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .
tr	Plur	But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
tr	Plur	""" Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process ,"" TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement ."
tr	Plur	Apart from the 1 , 200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country ' s sovereignty .
tr	Plur	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Plur	While most U . S . secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with , few have been as brazen as Colin Powell .
tr	Plur	Two years ago , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements .
tr	Plur	Realists , and this even includes members of the U . S . Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo .
tr	Plur	Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed , with some used as building material and others as urinals .
tr	Plur	"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
tr	Plur	Unfortunately for them , the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell ' s frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad .
tr	Plur	Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell ' s bluff , challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands .
tr	Plur	We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam .
tr	Plur	"Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "" band of brothers ""."
tr	Plur	"We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
tr	Plur	And , let ' s remember , flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous !
tr	Plur	They don ' t let just anybody do it .
tr	Plur	Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush ' s service in the Texas Air National Guard .
tr	Plur	Read on to learn the facts .
tr	Plur	Bush ’ s National Guard years
tr	Plur	Six weeks of basic training .
tr	Plur	Fifty - three weeks of flight training .
tr	Plur	Twenty - one weeks of fighter - interceptor training .
tr	Plur	That was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training periods thrown in as well .
tr	Plur	Not two years of weekends .
tr	Plur	Two years .
tr	Plur	The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
tr	Plur	His superior officers said OK .
tr	Plur	Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry ’ s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
tr	Plur	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it ’ s important or not in November .
tr	Plur	We should know as much as we can .
tr	Plur	Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas .
tr	Plur	Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi ' s Al - Iraqiya list .
tr	Plur	Indeed , Sistani ' s agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
tr	Plur	Fistfights , please .
tr	Plur	Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
tr	Plur	Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
tr	Plur	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
tr	Plur	Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April , 2004 , with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques .
tr	Plur	First driving out the Americans , then fighting the Shia back into submission ( as in 1991 ).
tr	Plur	Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation .
tr	Plur	Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
tr	Plur	Very recently , US forces in Al - Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul - Razaq Inad Al - Gu ' ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe .
tr	Plur	The Shia cannot live without the Sunnis , and vice versa .
tr	Plur	Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
tr	Plur	Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada ' s whereabouts with an indefinite shrug .
tr	Plur	"Meiring ' s crimes are fresh , and wave the false flag which is the "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Plur	They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
tr	Plur	The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
tr	Plur	Posada ' s crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who don ' t know their history .
tr	Plur	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
tr	Plur	Sheriff ' s deputies in Louisiana made a third arrest Wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of children and animals at a Ponchatoula , La ., church .
tr	Plur	Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church .
tr	Plur	We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose .
tr	Plur	"yeah , "" things ""..."
tr	Plur	The newly released papers , showing him complicit in the airliner bombing , were mentioned
tr	Plur	+ As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Plur	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
tr	Plur	These alleged members of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have been charged with illegal entry .
tr	Plur	Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels .
tr	Plur	"Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy ' s Far Eastern Naval Command , now being established along with India ' s "" blue water navy ""."
tr	Plur	Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
tr	Plur	The drugs and arms travel in all directions .
tr	Plur	"Since the "" Sea Tigers "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
tr	Plur	A large number of them are Bangladeshis , who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere .
tr	Plur	As most of them have few technical skills , and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case , they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities .
tr	Plur	Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on - the - ground intelligence , and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands .
tr	Plur	These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily , bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia .
tr	Plur	Intelligence lapses
tr	Plur	As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny .
tr	Plur	"The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro - India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
tr	Plur	In 2001 , according to Indian army officials , security forces launched a wide - ranging operation in the 300 - some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar , and found huge caches of arms .
tr	Plur	"The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "" other terrorist groups ""."
tr	Plur	Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket - propelled - grenade launchers , 20 assault rifles , M - 79 grenade launchers and more than 10 , 000 rounds of ammunition .
tr	Plur	Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People ' s Front .
tr	Plur	As a result , north of the Andaman Islands , Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms .
tr	Plur	A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan .
tr	Plur	India ' s Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1 , 000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal .
tr	Plur	Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia .
tr	Plur	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Plur	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Plur	For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India .
tr	Plur	The neighbours are still interfering , but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’ s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it .
tr	Plur	All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process , but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan .
tr	Plur	‘’ Where are Mullah Omar , Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar ?’’
tr	Plur	However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
tr	Plur	US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’ s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections .
tr	Plur	However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .
tr	Plur	Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders , who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency .
tr	Plur	Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt . General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
tr	Plur	Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
tr	Plur	Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
tr	Plur	Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also .
tr	Plur	However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same .
tr	Plur	However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates .
tr	Plur	Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran ’ s border .
tr	Plur	Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan ’ s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai ’ s campaign against warlords .
tr	Plur	At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’ s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo - conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively , the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran .
tr	Plur	Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand .
tr	Plur	In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections , they would be resisted .
tr	Plur	Many Taliban living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai .
tr	Plur	The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
tr	Plur	Most of those making the charges have even flip - flopped , contradicting themselves .
tr	Plur	Or they weren ' t eyewitnesses and are just lying .
tr	Plur	For decades .
tr	Plur	Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
tr	Plur	"Even for those who later abstain , "" visual - spatial abilities , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , are the slowest to recover ."""
tr	Plur	"We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
tr	Plur	""" All Things Considered ( 8 : 00 PM ET ) - NPR March 30 , 2004 Tuesday"
tr	Plur	For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr . Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
tr	Plur	They ' re going to talk about their kids , they ' re going to talk about football , they ' re going to talk about the weather .
tr	Plur	Again , decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
tr	Plur	Some 200 , 000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
tr	Plur	But the four planeloads of arms have vanished .
tr	Plur	Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense .
tr	Plur	American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq .
tr	Plur	But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights , which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005 .
tr	Plur	Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US , British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents .
tr	Plur	"There are concerns that some may have been siphoned off ."""
tr	Plur	"Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "" lost "" in Iraq , planeloads of arms don ' t just "" vanish ""; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout ' s untouchable stature ."
tr	Plur	Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .

tr	Plur	More than ever , police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes , even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions .
tr	Plur	When victims and witnesses speak up , at least sometimes a child is protected , the truth is exposed , and justice is done .
tr	Plur	And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation .
tr	Plur	Police and prosecutors have the tools .
tr	Plur	Some do , individually .
tr	Plur	lots of important stories out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good souls for that conviction .
tr	Plur	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
tr	Plur	When the FLDS under Mr . Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10 , 000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex - members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
tr	Plur	"At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state officials said Jeffs "" is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards ."""
tr	Plur	""" The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth ,"" Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center ' s "" Intelligence Report ."""
tr	Plur	We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming ....
tr	Plur	Funny how some things are squirelled away by well - meaning prosecutors ...
tr	Plur	Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
tr	Plur	Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life .
tr	Plur	Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time .
tr	Plur	"So we "" lost "" some weapon ?"
tr	Plur	We wouldn ' t want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us .
tr	Plur	What ' s a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash ?
tr	Plur	They really are milking the incompetence angle though , aren ' t they ?
tr	Plur	US outsourcing special ops , intelligence to Iraq terror group , intelligence officials say
tr	Plur	The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ...
tr	Plur	('' We have three generations of martyrs : grandmothers , mothers , daughters .'')
tr	Plur	Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf , where they lived separated from their parents .
tr	Plur	Family visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays .
tr	Plur	When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
tr	Plur	Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France .
tr	Plur	The Rajavis , Afshari went on to say , '' saw these kids as the next generation ' s soldiers .
tr	Plur	They wanted to brainwash them and control them .''
tr	Plur	Okay , it ' s partly about strippers and dope .
tr	Plur	And we ' ll get around to that .
tr	Plur	The people who carry out these underground arms / drugs / sex trafficking deals are trauma based mind controlled slaves .
tr	Plur	"What about Manson ' s tees bearing the message , "" Kill your parents ""."
tr	Plur	"And were the Columbine killers acting out this "" real morality "" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates ."
tr	Plur	They were death metal brainwashed fans , literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
tr	Plur	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter - cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but doesn ' t apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
tr	Plur	The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .
tr	Plur	We ' re entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio - political - spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection .
tr	Plur	But to me , without question , they often know perfectly well .
tr	Plur	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ""."
tr	Plur	They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home .
tr	Plur	The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together .
tr	Plur	But their parents refused to accept this .
tr	Plur	Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Plur	They are doing it deliberately .
tr	Plur	They are merely imposters .
tr	Plur	So why even credit their claims ?
tr	Plur	They want to be identified as ' Christians ', and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician ' s practice of the inversion principle .
tr	Plur	We need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
tr	Plur	See them as they are , not for what they claim to be .
tr	Plur	... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
tr	Plur	Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
tr	Plur	"They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they "" do as they wilt ."""
tr	Plur	Are the adherent of ' Crowleyan Thelema ' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect ' energy ?'
tr	Plur	My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
tr	Plur	Not 200 , 000 guns - the numbers dont work :
tr	Plur	Lo and behold , the Mormons were there with a booth .
tr	Plur	Two young men delivering information about the Mormon genealogy program .
tr	Plur	Kindly young men , but utterly programmed and brain - dead .
tr	Plur	= Executive Orders -
tr	Plur	They have been accumulating for years , and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever he feels like it .
tr	Plur	Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
tr	Plur	Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well ?
tr	Plur	My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion .
tr	Plur	True believers are dangerous animals .
tr	Plur	Sub - cultures ( as the lable implies ) do not develope in a vacuum .
tr	Plur	These people are dangerous wether they ' re head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers '.
tr	Plur	You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
tr	Plur	The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Plur	The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
tr	Plur	The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
tr	Plur	They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
tr	Plur	These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
tr	Plur	Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
tr	Plur	They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
tr	Plur	Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
tr	Plur	The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
tr	Plur	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
tr	Plur	"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "":"
tr	Plur	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
tr	Plur	We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
tr	Plur	How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
tr	Plur	Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
tr	Plur	Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .
tr	Plur	What is behind the suicide murders ?
tr	Plur	Wouldn ' t you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
tr	Plur	Aren ' t they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
tr	Plur	Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
tr	Plur	They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
tr	Plur	Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
tr	Plur	There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
tr	Plur	* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies .*
tr	Plur	Words can be lethal .
tr	Plur	They kill people .
tr	Plur	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
tr	Plur	An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
tr	Plur	After all , if you want to be an anti - Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
tr	Plur	But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
tr	Plur	When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
tr	Plur	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
tr	Plur	You will not believe your own eyes .
tr	Plur	But words also work in other ways , more subtle .
tr	Plur	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
tr	Plur	There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
tr	Plur	These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
tr	Plur	They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
tr	Plur	Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
tr	Plur	The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
tr	Plur	These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
tr	Plur	They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
tr	Plur	Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
tr	Plur	The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
tr	Plur	Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
tr	Plur	Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
tr	Plur	"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
tr	Plur	There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
tr	Plur	Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
tr	Plur	These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
tr	Plur	But now we have an entire new set .
tr	Plur	All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
tr	Plur	"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as "" war criminals ,"" with some Western media repeating the allegations ."
tr	Plur	What can we do about it ?
tr	Plur	The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
tr	Plur	Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter - propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
tr	Plur	Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
tr	Plur	Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
tr	Plur	"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
tr	Plur	Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
tr	Plur	When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
tr	Plur	What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
tr	Plur	If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
tr	Plur	We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
tr	Plur	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Plur	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Plur	"In a statement issued June 16 , 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission Staff concluded that "" Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 ."
tr	Plur	Photographs from a seized computer disc included the controls and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot .
tr	Plur	Many people have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the mailings served as a threat and warning .
tr	Plur	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
tr	Plur	Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda ' s # 3 , included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise .
tr	Plur	Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9 / 11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
tr	Plur	Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast .
tr	Plur	Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
tr	Plur	""" What we know is that he ' s always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies ,"" former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said ."
tr	Plur	A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
tr	Plur	According to senior counter terrorism officials , both here and abroad , among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it .
tr	Plur	According to some reports , Zawahiri is thought by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
tr	Plur	At one time , some thought he had been spotted in Iran .
tr	Plur	Wherever he is , authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited .
tr	Plur	Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed ' s computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons .
tr	Plur	( Spores must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable .)
tr	Plur	Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
tr	Plur	Although the details of the documents on Mohammed ' s computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings .
tr	Plur	Various doctors , both foreign and American , are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives , to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan , a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui , PhD , from Karachi .
tr	Plur	If mistaken , how did those reports first come about ?
tr	Plur	The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt .
tr	Plur	They would know .
tr	Plur	According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative ' s house ).
tr	Plur	"The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda ' s "" Chemical Wire Group ."""
tr	Plur	He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present .
tr	Plur	"( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design )."
tr	Plur	The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq ' s secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
tr	Plur	Two top Iraqi scientists , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi ' s anthrax program , according to Dr . David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
tr	Plur	Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI ' s involvement in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries .
tr	Plur	Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq .
tr	Plur	The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention .
tr	Plur	"Most of the "" talking heads "" on television , however , knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers ."
tr	Plur	( The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun ).
tr	Plur	The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D . C ..
tr	Plur	They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman .
tr	Plur	The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
tr	Plur	"Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned , addressed to "" Parole Officer ."""
tr	Plur	Although while in jail in the early 1980s , Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik ' s ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group , Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman ' s friends .
tr	Plur	Thus , the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda ' s anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center .
tr	Plur	"In the very interview in which they admitted 9 / 11 , and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes , the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the date 9 / 11 , and used the symbolism of the "" Green Birds ."""
tr	Plur	"A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "" school "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
tr	Plur	What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet ?
tr	Plur	Whatever your political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve our support .
tr	Plur	First , the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI is doing .
tr	Plur	Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion , it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr . Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case .
tr	Plur	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him .
tr	Plur	Typically , we receive both FX and inflation from you , but both curves may not always be used .
tr	Plur	Philippines
tr	Plur	Please send us the list of the curves that you will need to revalue our international assets for the August Board meeting .
tr	Plur	We are aiming to have the programme printed next week , so I would really need to know as soon as possible if you would be available to speak at this year ' s congress .

tr	Plur	We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
tr	Plur	Should we set a date now ?
tr	Plur	On the means of delivery , I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent .
tr	Plur	With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .
tr	Plur	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations .
tr	Plur	We have been able to keep ENA ' s direct group expenses flat year on year , we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
tr	Plur	Regards
tr	Plur	In some respects I don ' t think the first panel could have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for different reasons ).
tr	Plur	The other staff reports are also looking good .
tr	Plur	Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large , regulated utility in California .
tr	Plur	Can we get some help on the IBM issues ?
tr	Plur	There are still four important issues , however :
tr	Plur	No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
tr	Plur	Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
tr	Plur	They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .
tr	Plur	Please let us know if you have additional questions .
tr	Plur	Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we can ' t and where they are ?

tr	Plur	Here are the top ten most requested eSpeakers .
tr	Plur	8 . Satisfied Enron Customers
tr	Plur	While we can ' t make any promises , we will do our best to bring in at least some of these special guests .

tr	Plur	Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office ?

tr	Plur	Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold .

tr	Plur	We would still keep the 20 , 000 , 000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement .
tr	Plur	We too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us .
tr	Plur	a few things regading the POA / Cargill line ..
tr	Plur	We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line , putting us over the limit , without me knowing ...
tr	Plur	We could change the language of the POA to this ...
tr	Plur	we will not go over Global ' s piece of the Cargill line ...

tr	Plur	We have had no contact with the ENA / Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don ' t want to bust any structuring goals .
tr	Plur	Our project manager ( Scott Laidlaw ) and engineer ( Harry Okabayashi ) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work .
tr	Plur	These are always difficult times .
tr	Plur	But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes .
tr	Plur	As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable , it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can .

tr	Plur	So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
tr	Plur	We are doing quite well .
tr	Plur	There are three possible dates for the meeting , which I suggest be in two parts -- first , a meeting among the panel only from 5 : 00 - 6 : 30 p . m ., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6 : 30 - 8 : 30 p . m .

tr	Plur	"With respect to Deutsche Bank ("""" DB ""), we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
tr	Plur	But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
tr	Plur	Hopefully , if we ' re still dating come December , you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit .

tr	Plur	Hey guys , take Monday off !
tr	Plur	Regards
tr	Plur	Additional resources are being allocated and the situation is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operations ).
tr	Plur	Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .
tr	Plur	that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications )
tr	Plur	that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses , AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable )
tr	Plur	We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .
tr	Plur	Regards
tr	Plur	Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business .
tr	Plur	"Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ("" OBSF "") which commenced two weeks before the year end ."
tr	Plur	Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet .
tr	Plur	The AR / AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1 .
tr	Plur	User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF .
tr	Plur	Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
tr	Plur	Regards
tr	Plur	After talking with Professors Titman , Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for .
tr	Plur	After talking with you and Professors Titman , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy - finance .
tr	Plur	After talking with you and Professors Ronn , Brown and Jemison , I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy - finance .
tr	Plur	Will we be valuing / booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options ?
tr	Plur	What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra - day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols )?
tr	Plur	Regards ,
tr	Plur	"We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "" assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses "" associated with the manual system ."
tr	Plur	"We will fight with them about who owes the $ 200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "" assist "" us in managing the cost ."
tr	Plur	In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .
tr	Plur	Do we have someone who is watching this out there ?
tr	Plur	We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected , but let me know what we can do .
tr	Plur	We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200 , 987 . 33 for the period of July through September .
tr	Plur	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .
tr	Plur	In discussion with Dave , we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers .
tr	Plur	However , as you will see , the questions I thought of got kinda long - but I think we need answers for all of them .
tr	Plur	Norma , any thoughts ?
tr	Plur	Many people at Enron already have this type of chair , but we rarely , if ever , have a surplus because they are so popular .

tr	Plur	There have been some issues with getting everything coordinated lately and I wanted to make sure that we knew who was on point .
tr	Plur	Board members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO Forum on Thursday , September 13 .
tr	Plur	However , we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel .
tr	Plur	To reserve one of these rooms , you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group .
tr	Plur	We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to members of the DISCO Forum on July 20 .
tr	Plur	We are looking forward to seeing you on September 12 .
tr	Plur	We are receiving invoices from Ace Federal Reporters for transcripts of the recent FERC settlement conferences .

tr	Plur	Please use the attached for Associate and Analyst evaluations .
tr	Plur	All Evaluations for Associates and Analysts must be completed using this form .
tr	Plur	Can we have a meeting this week ( maybe Thursday at 3 : 30 ) to discuss this ?
tr	Plur	We do need a formal plan .
tr	Plur	We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions .
tr	Plur	We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
tr	Plur	Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored .
tr	Plur	Those who show up and complain , but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls , board meetings , etc . are ignored .
tr	Plur	Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
tr	Plur	We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised .
tr	Plur	Can we find another time that works for us to meet ?
tr	Plur	As important , the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market .
tr	Plur	Let ' s get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference .
tr	Plur	We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order , filing , etc . with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information .
tr	Plur	Many details remain to be worked out , but we will keep you advised .
tr	Plur	Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting experience .

tr	Plur	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .

tr	Plur	Here are the sample Agreements .
tr	Plur	Please let us know if you need anything else .
tr	Plur	We have GIS ids , and Eid ( external id - just like GIS id ).
tr	Plur	Since Enron ' s employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers ( P number ) and an HR number , could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers ?
tr	Plur	We could use our badge number there instead of our SS .

tr	Plur	Hi Ya ' ll ,
tr	Plur	Regards ,
tr	Plur	Regards ,
tr	Plur	please print all these for me .
tr	Plur	FYI re : NEPCO picketing issues .
tr	Plur	We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth , Florida project as well .
tr	Plur	In that respect , we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team .
tr	Plur	We will need local legal counsel to assist us in this regard .
tr	Plur	Can you tell us where .
tr	Plur	Can we reschedule the phone call for 9 am ( Houston ) which is 11 am ( Sao Paulo ) on Friday , Sept . 17 ?
tr	Plur	"Other "" guidelines "" exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia ."
tr	Plur	Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US ( although LA . is about as close as you can get to a third world country ).
tr	Plur	They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes .
tr	Plur	With best regards ,
tr	Plur	Regards .

tr	Plur	Parties , attached is the promised ruling that provides procedural guidance for the hearings on 12 / 27 and 12 / 28 .
tr	Plur	Gas Accord II Settlement Participants :
tr	Plur	We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
tr	Plur	The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *
tr	Plur	We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback .

tr	Plur	Greetings Judge Minkin :
tr	Plur	Few points :
tr	Plur	Comments can be forwarded to me via email , pager ( 888 . 916 . 7184 ), voicemail ( 415 . 782 . 7822 ), or home ( 415 . 621 . 8317 ).
tr	Plur	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Plur	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).

tr	Plur	We will finalize the message points on tomorrow ' s daily call ( 10 AM CST ).
tr	Plur	The Commission ' s hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM ( PST ).
tr	Plur	In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
tr	Plur	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
tr	Plur	And Carl Wood ' s remarks were extreme .
tr	Plur	"The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "" real "" investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works ."
tr	Plur	On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
tr	Plur	"In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) "" played by the rules ,"" but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers ."
tr	Plur	Rates can ' t go up w / out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion --- trying to finesse it .
tr	Plur	Due to business reasons , previously scheduled interviewers from the Penn team have had to cancel their participation .
tr	Plur	Campus interviews are scheduled as follows :
tr	Plur	Day One Interviews Day Two Interviews
tr	Plur	Interviewers : Kevin McGowan - confirmed
tr	Plur	They are currently working on a bid ( due 1 / 31 ) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy ( operator ), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
tr	Plur	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40 , 000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
tr	Plur	Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon ' s West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
tr	Plur	We typically only book deals when everything is signed off .
tr	Plur	these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .
tr	Plur	we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .
tr	Plur	therefore they will not attempt to make this claim .
tr	Plur	even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .
tr	Plur	Regards ,
tr	Plur	Any plans for the weekend ?
tr	Plur	After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived .
tr	Plur	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
tr	Plur	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
tr	Plur	We are planning this event for Thursday , February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed .
tr	Plur	We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon .
tr	Plur	We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9am - 12pm ) or afternoon ( 2pm - 5pm ) complete session .
tr	Plur	Marianne : The following are my comments :
tr	Plur	10 . In Collateral Requests , insert a comma after deposit in the last line .
tr	Plur	1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer ' s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T & D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer ' s utility .
tr	Plur	"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs )."
tr	Plur	"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ..."
tr	Plur	Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched .
tr	Plur	If so , are we ready to execute ?
tr	Plur	Are we playing tomorrow at 9 : 30 ?
tr	Plur	Once we agree on the list , we can sign the EEI Master .
tr	Plur	We need to include all outstanding transactions .
tr	Plur	We can accept the language with your chnages .
tr	Plur	Are we ready to execute ?
tr	Plur	Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
tr	Plur	We hope to execute this Agreement this week .
tr	Plur	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Plur	We hope to execute this Agreement this week .
tr	Plur	We ' ve booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday , May 24 to Newark / Rome and returning on Sunday , June 9 from Rome to Newark / Houston .
tr	Plur	We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page , we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers .
tr	Plur	We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page , we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers .
tr	Plur	These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago .
tr	Plur	Any thoughts ?
tr	Plur	Revenues for these customers were adjusted according .
tr	Plur	Also , revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW ' s tariff rates were adjusted accordingly .
tr	Plur	Monday ' s are always tough .
tr	Plur	Let ' s talk before I leave town next Wednesday .
tr	Plur	Let ' s discuss .
tr	Plur	These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect .
tr	Plur	( From time PA approved and funded to in - service will be 75 days at most .
tr	Plur	We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone .
tr	Plur	We will try to complete the I / C with the earliest in - service date possible , but with conditions as they are , a realistic date would be June 15 , 2002 .
tr	Plur	We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar ' s property ).
tr	Plur	Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators -- asking about haircuts in particular -- and Edison is side - stepping the questions .
tr	Plur	"They ' re holding "" workshops "" on how it will all work soon ."
tr	Plur	Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state ' s energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis , pushed the state into the power - buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers .
tr	Plur	Winter defied his own board and Gov . Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .
tr	Plur	The subpoenas will force those involved , including Winter , to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee , and to turn over e - mails , personal calendars and memos .
tr	Plur	""" We had to take action .''"
tr	Plur	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .
tr	Plur	Records show that on Oct . 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .
tr	Plur	The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators .
tr	Plur	In the Oct . 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren ' t removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
tr	Plur	The generators got their way .
tr	Plur	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they couldn ' t make a profit even under these constraints .
tr	Plur	They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec . 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .
tr	Plur	With the price caps gone , the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs .
tr	Plur	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO records show .
tr	Plur	Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .
tr	Plur	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .
tr	Plur	"We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund ."""
tr	Plur	""" They ( ISO management ) did what any independent system operator would do ."""
tr	Plur	We should resurrect Mike Smith ' s note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one .
tr	Plur	Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter .
tr	Plur	As I recall , Montavano , Shapiro and I usually make up one team , but I ' m willing to switch around a bit .
tr	Plur	Have they expressed any interest in negotiating ?
tr	Plur	In the three years I have been here , I am unaware of an ENA / ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company .
tr	Plur	We sued Houston Casualty last year but I don ' t recall making any bad faith claims .
tr	Plur	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Plur	We did receive a payment for $ 3 , 202 . 61 on 11 - 20 - 2000 .
tr	Plur	Here are the revised dates for the response / reply / and hearing dates for Enron ' s motion to compel .
tr	Plur	As you may recall , they say they want a deposition on the parties ' intention .
tr	Plur	We should be expecting a deposition notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat .
tr	Plur	The trustee ' s oppositon papers are now due Nov 27 and Enron reply is due Dec 1 .
tr	Plur	We are still very interested in having Enron support our eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol .?
tr	Plur	We have had enthusiastic responses from companies such as AT & T , Duke Energy , Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler , and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal point for our educational efforts .?
tr	Plur	We are very concerned with providing services that are relevant to that environment .
tr	Plur	We would like to meet between November 14 and ? December 1 ? since construction of our services is already underway .?
tr	Plur	Hello Energyphiles :
tr	Plur	WHAT : Copies of the filed complaint will be made available at that time .
tr	Plur	We are hopeful that we can post the complaint to the UCAN web site later today .
tr	Plur	Look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating , yet they do .
tr	Plur	These are the people who keep Jerry springer on the air .
tr	Plur	These are the kids who will destroy society , because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture , you heard again .
tr	Plur	Not so , Kids are what kids are and will do what they do .
tr	Plur	It ' s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
tr	Plur	Very few parents do this .
tr	Plur	People like this will never have my sympathy , nor do they deserve my sympathy .
tr	Plur	Look inside yourselves parents , is this you ?
tr	Plur	"Stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to "" get a break "" ."
tr	Plur	"Now , NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with "" go "" fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches ."
tr	Plur	We don ' t need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species .
tr	Plur	Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems ( as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses ).
tr	Plur	But supporters are pointing a few good things out :
tr	Plur	A few weeks ago , shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry .
tr	Plur	But lets hope for their sake ( and the sake of all space lovers out there ) that they can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again .
tr	Plur	We are only as strong as our weakest , we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager .
tr	Plur	When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do , not only are they hurting us , but they are hurting themselves .
tr	Plur	We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment , our rejection of the natural for the industrial , and our embrace of violence over peace .
tr	Plur	Fortunately circumstances will force our hand soon since our collective bad behaviour cannot continue indefinitely .
tr	Plur	Will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard ?
tr	Plur	Will we choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger ?
tr	Plur	Innovative Products
tr	Plur	Consider these convenience factors :
tr	Plur	Exotic juice benefits without the big bottle ( no glass and water weight )

tr	Plur	The Benefits
tr	Plur	Irregularities in menstruation will be cured .
tr	Plur	Glandular secretions will become regulated .
tr	Plur	Troubles in the bladder and urethra will be cured .
tr	Plur	Fear complexes will be removed .
tr	Plur	The eighteen steps of the dance are done rhythmically .
tr	Plur	"Then to the beat of "" dhin , dhin ,... , ta ', ta '"", the dancers begin their step , placing the big toe behind the heel of the other foot ."
tr	Plur	In the final two steps , the dancers firmly stamp their feet on the ground .
tr	Plur	"When the dancers start the step with the beat of "" dhin , dhin ..."", the mental ideation should also be kept ."
tr	Plur	"The two hands when upraised and folded together represent : "" Now I am trying to establish a link with Parama Purus ' a ( Supreme Consciousness )."""
tr	Plur	"The last two steps represent : "" O Lord I repeat Your cosmic rhythm ."""
tr	Plur	The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack , experts said .
tr	Plur	The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
tr	Plur	Apple Computers
tr	Plur	After founders - Stanford graduate students Sergey Brin and Larry Page presented their project to an angel investor , they received a cheque made out to ' Google '
tr	Plur	Lotus ( Notes )
tr	Plur	They kept the name Oracle and created the RDBMS engine .
tr	Plur	Later they kept the same name for the company .
tr	Plur	Andreas Bechtolsheim built a microcomputer ; Vinod Khosla recruited him and Scott McNealy to manufacture computers based on it , and Bill Joy to develop a UNIX - based OS for the computer .
tr	Plur	There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing Guild Wars , so why create a new one ?
tr	Plur	Regards ,
tr	Plur	BUT they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long .
tr	Plur	The graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics I have ever seen for any game and I have been gaming since the MUD days .

tr	Plur	We are here .
tr	Plur	Who are we ?
tr	Plur	We are the downtrodden and dispossesed , the self - torturing , the disenfranchised convicts , drug and alcohol addicts , the unemployed and unemployable .
tr	Plur	We are the children of poverty , financial and spiritual .
tr	Plur	We have and will have children of our own , grandchildren too .
tr	Plur	We are ex - cons , uninsured , homeless , of many colors and speaking many tongues .
tr	Plur	You who watch as budgets are cut in education and health care while you militarize a police force ?
tr	Plur	Bullet - proof vests , automatic weapons , helicopters , tanks , robots ... the testosterone is oozing through the streets , more prisons , longer sentences , tighten the belt , spartan conditions , task forces , gang units , gun courts .
tr	Plur	Most of us still have hope for ourselves even when stuck in the darkest dilemmas , ruts and catch - 22s .
tr	Plur	Most of us believe in crafting laws and instilling order .
tr	Plur	Many of us have burrowed beneath the surface to find a spiritual sense of being , an understanding force at least as powerful as those we succumbed to , and many of use wouldn ' t escape if you opened the front door .

tr	Plur	My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
tr	Plur	Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($ 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 ), both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
tr	Plur	Without the funds from our 1991 partners , we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq .
tr	Plur	Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice - president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
tr	Plur	Sincerely with warm regards ,
tr	Plur	Emergency teams in the southern US are battling to reach survivors of Hurricane Katrina , the most destructive storm to hit the country in decades .
tr	Plur	Hundreds of people are feared dead in Mississippi , and the Louisiana city of New Orleans is badly flooded .
tr	Plur	Amid worsening conditions , officials plan to evacuate a New Orleans stadium where up to 20 , 000 people took shelter .
tr	Plur	""" We were screaming , hollering , flashing lights ."
tr	Plur	Walls keeping water out of the bowl - shaped city have been breached , and emergency teams are using helicopters to drop 1 , 350kg ( 3 , 000lb ) sandbags and concrete barriers into the gaps .
tr	Plur	Before the phones went , I was told [ my family in Biloxi ] had lost their roof , barn , 2 oak trees and many pines and they were letting in water
tr	Plur	Your Katrina experiences
tr	Plur	Heavily armed police have been trying to impose a form of martial law to stem outbreaks of looting .
tr	Plur	While some looters are stealing non - essential goods , others are simply trying to find food and water .
tr	Plur	' Hundreds dead '
tr	Plur	Casinos housed in barges have been hurled onto the beach and beyond .
tr	Plur	Tens of thousands are homeless , and officials say it could be weeks before power is restored .
tr	Plur	Survivors are being found all the time , including two children who lost their parents .
tr	Plur	Damage estimates of more than $ 25bn suggest it could be the US insurance industry ' s most expensive natural disaster ever .

tr	Plur	"For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China ' s relations with "" pariah states ""."
tr	Plur	Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities .

tr	Plur	Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
tr	Plur	Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that .
tr	Plur	Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth .
tr	Plur	Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ), the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
tr	Plur	The golden rays feel soft and soothing .
tr	Plur	Your muscles are loose and limp .
tr	Plur	The sun ' s rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .
tr	Plur	Open your eyes .
tr	Plur	Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you ' re repeating it .
tr	Plur	From what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage .

tr	Plur	We become most fully human when we love another person .
tr	Plur	We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
tr	Plur	The American laws forbidding interracial marriage , now struck down , were clearly discriminatory .
tr	Plur	We feel called to protest and oppose this injustice .
tr	Plur	As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life .
tr	Plur	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
tr	Plur	As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
tr	Plur	We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
tr	Plur	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
tr	Plur	However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
tr	Plur	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .
tr	Plur	We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter .
tr	Plur	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
tr	Plur	As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
tr	Plur	My Fellow Americans :
tr	Plur	His co - workers love him .
tr	Plur	His fellow judges love him .
tr	Plur	But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
tr	Plur	In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
tr	Plur	Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .

tr	Plur	Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath .
tr	Plur	Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program ' s goals
tr	Plur	Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .
tr	Plur	But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
tr	Plur	""" They are not going to rush it , because they don ' t want it to be a budget buster ."
tr	Plur	China ' s overtures to join the U . S .- led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country ' s human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat .
tr	Plur	China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush ' s strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destinations .
tr	Plur	""" We wish them a successful return of their astronauts ."""
tr	Plur	As it turned out , the Soviets never made it to the moon .
tr	Plur	""" They would get in line in front of the Russians ."
tr	Plur	"And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch ."""
tr	Plur	The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China ' s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth ' s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .

tr	Plur	"The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their "" product "" as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love ."
tr	Plur	Right now , while we ' re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
tr	Plur	Any suggestions would be appreciated .
tr	Plur	Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds , where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires .
tr	Plur	They are confined in this way until they finally die .
tr	Plur	These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume .

tr	Plur	Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
tr	Plur	Their sheep could graze , their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard .
tr	Plur	After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .
tr	Plur	Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .
tr	Plur	These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .
tr	Plur	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
tr	Plur	Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park ' s northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .
tr	Plur	But we ' ve been looking at streamside communities .
tr	Plur	Since wolf recovery , streamside plants , willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing shrubs that bears can use .
tr	Plur	The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability .
tr	Plur	"Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems ."""
tr	Plur	""" Wolves are still pretty new ."
tr	Plur	They ' ve only been there for 10 years .
tr	Plur	"In 10 more years we ' ll have a better idea ."""
tr	Plur	Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .
tr	Plur	Wolves can migrate considerable distances .
tr	Plur	There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31 , 000 mountain lions .
tr	Plur	Pound for pound , mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves .
tr	Plur	They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
tr	Plur	Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .
tr	Plur	Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?
tr	Plur	They seem to be just that : rumors .
tr	Plur	True , there are about 300 , 000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .
tr	Plur	Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends , but meanwhile Earth ' s plants , insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome .
tr	Plur	They already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening .
tr	Plur	Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier .
tr	Plur	Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology .
tr	Plur	Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat .
tr	Plur	""" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable ."""
tr	Plur	According to Parmesan ' s earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .
tr	Plur	Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier .
tr	Plur	Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .
tr	Plur	"Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many , many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean ."""
tr	Plur	"As the Pew report concluded , "" Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U . S . ecosystems ."""
tr	Plur	Such consequences include shifting and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems .
tr	Plur	"The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come ."""
tr	Plur	The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster .
tr	Plur	Important species that probably would decline include shrimp , capelin , Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish .
tr	Plur	The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument .
tr	Plur	They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non - commercial species , and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy .
tr	Plur	Feel free to cut and paste and leave your comments , as these viewpoints cover the entire gamut surrounding the event .
tr	Plur	What will be the lasting effects of Hurricane Katrina and what can be learnt from the response ?
tr	Plur	Relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people while authorities have vowed to restore security in New Orleans following a breakdown of law and order .
tr	Plur	In the world press , commentators predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad , especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed .

tr	Plur	Some of the better comments :

tr	Plur	Here , cars are absolutely necessary , and he ' d have to have one , too .
tr	Plur	Additionally , reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes , you ' ll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states .
tr	Plur	Unfortunately , those left behind to be filmed , where those without transportation or means .
tr	Plur	Some refused to leave , but so many were unable to .
tr	Plur	The 1 . 25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin to populate Houston , Dallas , San Antonio and Galveston , and the surrounding areas .
tr	Plur	Will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast ?
tr	Plur	These are some of the things I ' ve been wondering ...
tr	Plur	The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names .
tr	Plur	What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation .
tr	Plur	"We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "" FREEDOM "" why not spend those billions making all of us free ?"

tr	Plur	The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism .
tr	Plur	"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" they advise black Joe to "" get back to where you once belonged "", as if England was not a place for black people ."

tr	Plur	The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran .
tr	Plur	The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi ' ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ).
tr	Plur	Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi ' ite leadership in Iran that go back decades .
tr	Plur	Should the United States undertake military action against Iran , the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme .
tr	Plur	In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .
tr	Plur	2 . Iran ' s Armaments
tr	Plur	They include 120 , 000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .
tr	Plur	The so called ' Tanker ' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region .
tr	Plur	It is Iran ' s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .
tr	Plur	Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below .
tr	Plur	These missiles are , simply , the fastest anti - ship weapons on the planet .
tr	Plur	The missile ' s manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer , and five missiles could sink a 20 , 000 ton ship .
tr	Plur	Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 sailors .
tr	Plur	Iran , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies .
tr	Plur	While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .
tr	Plur	In the last several months , China has inked deals with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas .
tr	Plur	These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States .
tr	Plur	China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .
tr	Plur	"They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose ."""
tr	Plur	Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real incomes .
tr	Plur	Should they decide to squeeze , we will all feel it .
tr	Plur	American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .
tr	Plur	The last three years of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this confidence .
tr	Plur	Soldiers with vital training and know - how are refusing to re - enlist .
tr	Plur	Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .
tr	Plur	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .
tr	Plur	"The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror ."""
tr	Plur	Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media .
tr	Plur	All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .
tr	Plur	They did it once already in Iraq .
tr	Plur	The United States was to cut its level by 7 per cent .
tr	Plur	750 , 000 - Tons of toxic waste the US military , the world ' s biggest polluter , generates around the world each year .

tr	Plur	They can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands , then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
tr	Plur	The people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland .
tr	Plur	They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out , and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers .
tr	Plur	ur answers and reviews wud be highly appreciated ....... thanks !!!!!!!
tr	Plur	Watch out the poles are coming ..... my little butterfly

tr	Plur	You could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish ( also the parents ) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten .
tr	Plur	Feed the babies 3 - 4 times a day with flakes .
tr	Plur	"Look in the pet stores for "" fry food "" or "" baby fish foods ""."
tr	Plur	some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes

tr	Plur	they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i wouldnt .
tr	Plur	they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :)
tr	Plur	Theyre not really hard .
tr	Plur	Beardies are actually quite delicate .
tr	Plur	they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them .
tr	Plur	They just are there as an adaptation .
tr	Plur	The lower the reins , the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too .
tr	Plur	Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently .
tr	Plur	For horses that are strong pullers .
tr	Plur	wheels are relatively noiseless -
tr	Plur	a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet !
tr	Plur	If no , you ' ll have to go to one of the train stations .
tr	Plur	They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones ?
tr	Plur	Contact the Indian railways .
tr	Plur	Cover letters and resumes need to be perfect .
tr	Plur	Visas and Study Permits are administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada , and any questions regarding applications should be directed to them .

tr	Plur	Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier .
tr	Plur	Many thanks .
tr	Plur	HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?
tr	Plur	There are some things to consider though ...
tr	Plur	Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .
tr	Plur	Also , don ' t forget to try out Korea ' s famous amusement parks !: Lotte World , Everland , and Carribbean Bay !
tr	Plur	Doves are a species of pigeon , they are Seed eaters , they do not eat bread , or worms .
tr	Plur	as they can drink a lot .

tr	Plur	cheapest plastic surgeons in Thailand ?
tr	Plur	Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for . .
tr	Plur	Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
tr	Plur	The cheapest * high quality * plastic surgeons are at Yanhee Hospitals .
tr	Plur	They do outstanding work .
tr	Plur	They have done very well and like the dry food better .
tr	Plur	There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods .
tr	Plur	Read the labels for contents .
tr	Plur	My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver ( cooked ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest .
tr	Plur	They would be too scared and spooky .
tr	Plur	Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
tr	Plur	Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched .
tr	Plur	10 gallon nano reef ideas ?
tr	Plur	We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I ' m not an expert on the area .
tr	Plur	Oh my gosh , they are great !
tr	Plur	Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help .
tr	Plur	Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur bettas delicate fins .
tr	Plur	Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your water .
tr	Plur	Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
tr	Plur	ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up , they would know
tr	Plur	only in comic books and sci - fi tv shows / movies ... : D
tr	Plur	While they are extremely accurate , laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target .
tr	Plur	Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip .
tr	Plur	Laser grips are the most common for wangs .
tr	Plur	Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip .
tr	Plur	Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi - automatic wangs .
tr	Plur	Newer semi - automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft .
tr	Plur	Tighten these screws securely .
tr	Plur	Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
tr	Plur	However not in all cases .
tr	Plur	They will , however , cost a bunch .

tr	Plur	XBOX Joys are soo comfyy .....
tr	Plur	Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at ?
tr	Plur	from my experience with my cats 13 - 18 years depending on the breed .
tr	Plur	At 18 years , your cat has had a long life .
tr	Plur	Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11 - 15 years .
tr	Plur	Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues , so your cat has done very well .
tr	Plur	Male cats very seldom live past 14 - 15 years .
tr	Plur	Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare .
tr	Plur	By comparison , outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment .
tr	Plur	Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it ' s lost so easily !
tr	Plur	Birds eat and sleep with their flock , not predators .
tr	Plur	like my dogs , they really like me and trust me , but when I open the door to get them outside , they run from me , they know I ' m going to take them outside and they don ' t like it .
tr	Plur	My breyers need stables or barns though ..... and I need directions and materials on how to make them .
tr	Plur	Pictures would help !
tr	Plur	there are many small details , that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof ,
tr	Plur	check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts , you want carpenter wood glue , clamps , possibly small screws to hold corners together , miniature hinges , tape , paint , saws , drills , pencil ruler , paper , bryer horses
tr	Plur	No worries , i didn ' t try .
tr	Plur	lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , hes also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
tr	Plur	They LOVE to climb .
tr	Plur	Here are some better options IMO :
tr	Plur	These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
tr	Plur	what are your suggestions and opinons ?
tr	Plur	they will move if they get too warm - it ' s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
tr	Plur	What are good places to eat brunch at ? ?
tr	Plur	They have fabulous French toast too .

tr	Plur	What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
tr	Plur	Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
tr	Plur	Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
tr	Plur	Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
tr	Plur	Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa .
tr	Plur	You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
tr	Plur	My questions are ..
tr	Plur	2 ) did Vietnam m16 ' s have a 3 - shot burst function ?
tr	Plur	Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it wasn ' t .
tr	Plur	Today ' s weapons do not have that kind of problem , and are much more reliable .
tr	Plur	2 ) All M16 ' s are either automatic or semi automatic .
tr	Plur	Are the hotels back up and running ?
tr	Plur	Are there still aftershocks ?
tr	Plur	Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
tr	Plur	Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
tr	Plur	Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you ' ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
tr	Plur	Yes , yes and yes .
tr	Plur	Im around 5 ' 2 - 5 ' 4 , 11 years old and im wondering what size horse i ' ll need that i wont grow out of quickly ?
tr	Plur	"i ' m5 ' 3 - 4 "" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14 . 2hh and she ' s perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i can ' t bareback , not yet"
tr	Plur	Iguazu Falls
tr	Plur	However , save some of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River .
tr	Plur	The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
tr	Plur	Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
tr	Plur	For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls .
tr	Plur	The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
tr	Plur	As you ' re from the States you ' ll have much more fun in London .
tr	Plur	Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners .
tr	Plur	Let ’ s get this over with now …
tr	Plur	Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
tr	Plur	You can ' t MAKE them mate , you can only encourage them .
tr	Plur	Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
tr	Plur	They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
tr	Plur	The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them .
tr	Plur	Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones , but these usually are frequent visits , with small amounts of urine being passed .
tr	Plur	Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
tr	Plur	Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream .
tr	Plur	( we live in Pennsylvania btw ) I ' m mad and upset now !
tr	Plur	We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days .
tr	Plur	Enjoy those 2 days it better then not going at all .!
tr	Plur	and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places , i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go . : D
tr	Plur	If they don ' t like it , it ' ll only be two days , remember ?
tr	Plur	Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
tr	Plur	These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages .
tr	Plur	[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over - simplifying artistic developments , ignoring historical context , and focusing only on a few iconic works .
tr	Plur	There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
tr	Plur	Silkies have hookless feathers .
tr	Plur	Sussexs have soft feathers .
tr	Plur	Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate .
tr	Plur	Either way rec . and dom . white genes dilute the black gene .
tr	Plur	Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
tr	Plur	Feathered Feet / Shanks - Chicks could have feathered feet / shanks as this is also incomplete dominate .
tr	Plur	Five Toes : Silkies have five toes .
tr	Plur	Sussex have four toes .
tr	Plur	Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
tr	Plur	Silkie crosses are great birds , and very neat looking .
tr	Plur	Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
tr	Plur	Best wishes ,
tr	Plur	Not bad , but too many distracting elements for my taste .
tr	Plur	There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
tr	Plur	what are some unique customs in ireland ?
tr	Plur	In all my travels I ’ ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
tr	Plur	Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
tr	Plur	Another unique custom ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
tr	Plur	Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
tr	Plur	The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
tr	Plur	the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
tr	Plur	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Plur	Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
tr	Plur	Also , can animals remember images on TV like us , humans ?
tr	Plur	Do dogs enjoy watching T . V .?
tr	Plur	The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
tr	Plur	So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
tr	Plur	So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T . V ., it ’ s probably because of the sounds .
tr	Plur	Yes they do .
tr	Plur	If they ask how much I ' m willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
tr	Plur	Three hours isn ' t far , but you are doing multiple shows .
tr	Plur	Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
tr	Plur	Rusted , torn corners in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse .
tr	Plur	All horses I ' ve had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive .
tr	Plur	Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
tr	Plur	Do they have this anywhere ?
tr	Plur	Like you can pick the destinations ?
tr	Plur	"Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high "" single supplement "" costs in addition ."
tr	Plur	( Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone .
tr	Plur	You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ).
tr	Plur	Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines , typically 100 days in duration .
tr	Plur	Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
tr	Plur	yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
tr	Plur	HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
tr	Plur	As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
tr	Plur	The other ethicities weren ' t well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70 ' s due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
tr	Plur	It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
tr	Plur	Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid - 80s .
tr	Plur	We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
tr	Plur	We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then .
tr	Plur	We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
tr	Plur	Only Caucasians had any political power , corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods .
tr	Plur	We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
tr	Plur	The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
tr	Plur	Can rabbits and chickens live together ?
tr	Plur	We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
tr	Plur	We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it ' s nothing that a rabbit wouldn ' t be able to digest just fine .
tr	Plur	So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
tr	Plur	Yes , but be sure that your chickens are all hens ( I mean not roosters ), Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving , so be aware of that , hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !
tr	Plur	Be sure not to feed your rabbits non - veg items !
tr	Plur	So , don ' t put both of them in one cage .
tr	Plur	So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
tr	Plur	Rabbits do burrow also so don ' t be surprised if chicken are falling into holes .
tr	Plur	rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that .
tr	Plur	my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures .
tr	Plur	we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
tr	Plur	Just the zinc fumes will get you , if you don ' t take precautions .
tr	Plur	Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food ?
tr	Plur	Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
tr	Plur	They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
tr	Plur	Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions .
tr	Plur	We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
tr	Plur	Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
tr	Plur	To prevent animal cruelty , many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat .
tr	Plur	We can ' t dictate what business wants to open where .
tr	Plur	How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python ?
tr	Plur	They don ' t know ANYTHING about Ball pythons .
tr	Plur	Maybe if they see how much time and effort you ' ve devoted to researching the animal they ' ll reconsider .
tr	Plur	Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
tr	Plur	Be persistent , but don ' t pester them about it cause that ' ll get you nowhere fast .
tr	Plur	Do all your chores without being nagged , take care of any existing pets , keep your room clean , and so on .
tr	Plur	3 . Bargain with them .
tr	Plur	Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
tr	Plur	Any suggestions ?
tr	Plur	For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
tr	Plur	"A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
tr	Plur	Lets be clear about this ...........
tr	Plur	So don ' t pack your bags , yet .
tr	Plur	Hey guys .
tr	Plur	There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000 , close to the centre of these cities .
tr	Plur	Rooms start from 500 per double .
tr	Plur	Those ones are quite small .
tr	Plur	Also , while travelling ask people where they ' ve been and if they have any hotel recommendations .
tr	Plur	some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it .
tr	Plur	So my opinion is Guinea pigs .
tr	Plur	( plus they dont stink that bad )
tr	Plur	They ' re incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
tr	Plur	Again , pairs or trios and pretty big living space .
tr	Plur	They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
tr	Plur	We have two .
tr	Plur	They are social and like to be handled .
tr	Plur	Two males can fight and you definitely don ' t want babies !!
tr	Plur	Guinea pigs ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
tr	Plur	They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
tr	Plur	They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots .
tr	Plur	Don ' t feed them broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest .
tr	Plur	Also they can ' t eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
tr	Plur	Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT !
tr	Plur	They track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed ....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything , including my bare legs !
tr	Plur	My legs and hands are just full of scratches .
tr	Plur	Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated .
tr	Plur	Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring .
tr	Plur	Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
tr	Plur	They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
tr	Plur	Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator .
tr	Plur	They made need medication or deworming or something .
tr	Plur	They are testing out their claws and teeth .
tr	Plur	Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
tr	Plur	They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
tr	Plur	Generally they ' re not clawing and biting , they don ' t make nearly as much mess , they don ' t need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
tr	Plur	Take the kittens back to the shelter .
tr	Plur	what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Plur	what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
tr	Plur	including fees and forms
tr	Plur	Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child ' s birth at the town hall / registrar ' s office .
tr	Plur	My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities .
tr	Plur	they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
tr	Plur	My parents didn ' t send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment .
tr	Plur	- more fun activities
tr	Plur	- more teens
tr	Plur	Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .
tr	Plur	Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
tr	Plur	Are there any major differences between them ?
tr	Plur	For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Plur	We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don ' t believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
tr	Plur	Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .
tr	Plur	We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
tr	Plur	On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
tr	Plur	We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Plur	We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
tr	Plur	We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
tr	Plur	Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
tr	Plur	They both had pools for kids and adults .
tr	Plur	We liked the Liberty ' s pools better because one had a slide .
tr	Plur	We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
tr	Plur	What countries are the best to travel to ?
tr	Plur	In the United States ?
tr	Plur	Lots of places .
tr	Plur	There are 50 of them , 48 located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between .
tr	Plur	There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
tr	Plur	Big Cities like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast .
tr	Plur	Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston .
tr	Plur	The federal sites of Washington , DC .
tr	Plur	West Coast hot spots like Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles or San Diego .
tr	Plur	Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US .
tr	Plur	We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
tr	Plur	We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it .
tr	Plur	How could we make it settle in a new house .
tr	Plur	they just do it on their own .
tr	Plur	( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
tr	Plur	Yes , lots of time and lots of patients ...
tr	Plur	There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
tr	Plur	Try obedience classes .
tr	Plur	If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
tr	Plur	Also , any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well .
tr	Plur	The are located right at 248 De Than St . in the heart of the back packer district .
tr	Plur	The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
tr	Plur	Very few clubs and night activities .
tr	Plur	From either of those cities , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
tr	Plur	Most of the tourists that I ' ve come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
tr	Plur	We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
tr	Plur	We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
tr	Plur	But there are just so many poses and programs !
tr	Plur	Any good poses or programs ( I ' m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
tr	Plur	and will these antibiotics help ?
tr	Plur	They didnt take x - rays they offered them but i just couldnt afford anymore treatment .
tr	Plur	To answer your questions in order :
tr	Plur	They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
tr	Plur	They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
tr	Plur	NO SPICES !
tr	Plur	Did they do any x - rays ?
tr	Plur	I ' m in my 20 ' s and currently studying in France .
tr	Plur	For them , dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties , then pairing off .
tr	Plur	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
tr	Plur	They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
tr	Plur	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
tr	Plur	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
tr	Plur	Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
tr	Plur	Why not just take your chances and do it your way ?
tr	Plur	There are no jobs in this country .
tr	Plur	Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting , but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications ?
tr	Plur	And they ' ll probably add interest to what you ' ve already racked up .
tr	Plur	And they ' re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
tr	Plur	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
tr	Plur	My 2c . ....
tr	Plur	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , don ' t assume it ' s better in Oz .
tr	Plur	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it ' s not anything new .
tr	Plur	700f jobs aren ' t advertised .
tr	Plur	do babies this small hibernate ?
tr	Plur	They can smell it so i ' m sure he knows what it is and just don ' t want it .
tr	Plur	Remember snakes can go awhile without eating .
tr	Plur	King snakes sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
tr	Plur	They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
tr	Plur	In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
tr	Plur	They ' re fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
tr	Plur	are my two cats fighting or playing ?
tr	Plur	or were they actually fighting ?
tr	Plur	any answers help !!!!!!
tr	Plur	give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
tr	Plur	when they play fight , they don ' t hiss .
tr	Plur	if they hiss , they are not playing .
tr	Plur	if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .
tr	Plur	If they ' re going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as they can ), and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as they can with their paws ) then they ' re playing .
tr	Plur	When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia .
tr	Plur	All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated .
tr	Plur	The Communists agreed .
tr	Plur	They could not defeat the Americans .
tr	Plur	However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
tr	Plur	The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
tr	Plur	The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas .
tr	Plur	Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
tr	Plur	And the South Vietnamese people ?
tr	Plur	When give the ultimate choice , they rallied …
tr	Plur	They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
tr	Plur	The people rejected their attempt to topple the government , and for all intents and purposes the US military ( and the ARVN ) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time - frame he ordered it .
tr	Plur	They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it .
tr	Plur	The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ).
tr	Plur	In that , they pretty much succeeded .
tr	Plur	The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed ' s Repsitun model : http :// lllreptile . com / store / catalog / reptile - supplies / uvb - fluorescent - lights - mercury - vapor - bulbs /-/ zoo - med - 24 - repti - sun - 100 - fluorescent - bulb / Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .
tr	Plur	Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
tr	Plur	Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items , for variety ' s sake .
tr	Plur	if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if its a small tank and he can ' t escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
tr	Plur	Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so its anyone ' s guess whether or not he ' ll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
tr	Plur	Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach .
tr	Plur	They were chirping and doing their every day business .
tr	Plur	They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them .
tr	Plur	They dont want to be held or touched .
tr	Plur	They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
tr	Plur	First of all they are very tame .
tr	Plur	They can do tricks and they arent messy .
tr	Plur	Do not get two females .
tr	Plur	They sometimes dont get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
tr	Plur	They are the best !
tr	Plur	These are the steps I used .
tr	Plur	Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets .
tr	Plur	Hopefully they will work for you .
tr	Plur	Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
tr	Plur	( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
tr	Plur	When they see that you arnt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .
tr	Plur	Do not hit , yell , or harm them .
tr	Plur	They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !
tr	Plur	They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tr	Plur	They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
tr	Plur	They are also friendly .
tr	Plur	We don ' t want too many tourists , and since we ' ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
tr	Plur	We don ' t want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ), but we don ' t feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
tr	Plur	We ' re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we ' re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
tr	Plur	People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
tr	Plur	It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
tr	Plur	Some basic assumptions , however , can be made .
tr	Plur	Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
tr	Plur	Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country ’ s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
tr	Plur	Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ’ s Festival .
tr	Plur	Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular .
tr	Plur	Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ’ s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don ’ t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ’ s cold , grey and dark by 5pm , but there ’ s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
tr	Plur	Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
tr	Plur	We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24C on a few occasions , more like 14C most days .
tr	Plur	We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
tr	Plur	The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
tr	Plur	We had frosts in October so I wouldn ' t advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
tr	Plur	1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long .
tr	Plur	2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5cm long .
tr	Plur	If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive !
tr	Plur	Worms ( and Daphnia ) are also rich in Lipids , substances important in forming eggs and growing young .
tr	Plur	If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
tr	Plur	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
tr	Plur	Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .
tr	Plur	With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
tr	Plur	They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
tr	Plur	The water changes help with that too .
tr	Plur	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Plur	2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes ?
tr	Plur	TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist ' s hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department ' s annual reports .
tr	Plur	They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ).
tr	Plur	"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe ""."
tr	Plur	But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
tr	Plur	"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material ."
tr	Plur	Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .
tr	Plur	Get those out ASAP too .
tr	Plur	Any tips or advice to make this a great experience ??
tr	Plur	Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
tr	Plur	They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
tr	Plur	There can be many ideas ; one can see numerous options passing through their mind .
tr	Plur	There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
tr	Plur	No , the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages .
tr	Plur	Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
tr	Plur	There are two ships , Disney magic and Disney wonder .
tr	Plur	Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers .
tr	Plur	Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
tr	Plur	These are decorated uniquely and marvelously .
tr	Plur	Sea fishes , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard .
tr	Plur	There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
tr	Plur	There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
tr	Plur	They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
tr	Plur	These theme parks have all types of facilities .
tr	Plur	Video shows , cartoon stories , wonderful games and many such facilities .
tr	Plur	There are other amnesties also .
tr	Plur	These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
tr	Plur	There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
tr	Plur	We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
tr	Plur	With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
tr	Plur	Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there .
tr	Plur	They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
tr	Plur	We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
tr	Plur	All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
tr	Plur	You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
tr	Plur	Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
tr	Plur	We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we ' had ' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
tr	Plur	off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season .
tr	Plur	We had a ball .
tr	Plur	We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
tr	Plur	There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
tr	Plur	The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones .
tr	Plur	Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
tr	Plur	Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
tr	Plur	We were also just talking about my horse ' s crappy feet and he mentioned .
tr	Plur	"It ' s always just "" Okay , they ' re feet need to be done , better call the farrier ."""
tr	Plur	And they usually come out within a few days .
tr	Plur	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
tr	Plur	Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
tr	Plur	Leaving nails out so you ' ll call and have him come back out later ?
tr	Plur	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
tr	Plur	My other theory would be wobblers .
tr	Plur	So any ideas ?
tr	Plur	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
tr	Plur	We ' ve had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
tr	Plur	We ' ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .
tr	Plur	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
tr	Plur	Let us know what you decide to do .
tr	Plur	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn ' t work for my hair .

tr	Plur	We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
tr	Plur	Lovely People , Great Hats
tr	Plur	The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
tr	Plur	We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
tr	Plur	They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS , they will NOT take it back !
tr	Plur	And they THRIVE to get a customer .
tr	Plur	If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were .
tr	Plur	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
tr	Plur	The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal .
tr	Plur	We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it ' s worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
tr	Plur	They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
tr	Plur	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
tr	Plur	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
tr	Plur	They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
tr	Plur	Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first .
tr	Plur	We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley .
tr	Plur	We appreciated her patience , knowledge and kindness !
tr	Plur	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you ' ll be good .
tr	Plur	In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I ' m already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
tr	Plur	We love our new roof !
tr	Plur	We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
tr	Plur	We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job everyday .
tr	Plur	We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
tr	Plur	We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
tr	Plur	ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
tr	Plur	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won ' t use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
tr	Plur	They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .
tr	Plur	THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS .
tr	Plur	Do we need another one ?
tr	Plur	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
tr	Plur	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
tr	Plur	They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services .
tr	Plur	They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
tr	Plur	We love T ' s Cafe !
tr	Plur	Prominent Builders NJ
tr	Plur	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
tr	Plur	They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
tr	Plur	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
tr	Plur	They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet .
tr	Plur	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
tr	Plur	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
tr	Plur	They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won ' t hurt my score .
tr	Plur	They have a huge inventory .
tr	Plur	Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
tr	Plur	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
tr	Plur	( I ' ve been through at least 5 places already .)
tr	Plur	The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
tr	Plur	Overall they aren ' t very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
tr	Plur	We both kept trying to find something we liked .
tr	Plur	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
tr	Plur	Congratulations Prestige Hino !
tr	Plur	Each of you should be proud of your massive contributions throughout the year !
tr	Plur	Major Awards – Overall Hino dealer of the year .
tr	Plur	Major Awards – Market leader overall , Dandenong PMA , sales .
tr	Plur	The antipasti were amazing , the wines were mind - blowing , the service couldn ' t have been better .
tr	Plur	Great Prices , Great service !
tr	Plur	They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
tr	Plur	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
tr	Plur	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
tr	Plur	The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
tr	Plur	They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
tr	Plur	They don ' t care one bit about you !!!!!
tr	Plur	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
tr	Plur	Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
tr	Plur	"They said it was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts ."
tr	Plur	Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ).
tr	Plur	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
tr	Plur	Signs of Saltford - an excellent supplier of value for money signs and banners etc .
tr	Plur	Fantastic for kids
tr	Plur	They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
tr	Plur	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
tr	Plur	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
tr	Plur	Among the animals that were available to touch were pony ' s , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
tr	Plur	Wonderful , inexpensive and lots of fun !
tr	Plur	2 ) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
tr	Plur	The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
tr	Plur	and most correctly , us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife .
tr	Plur	While there wasn ' t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
tr	Plur	They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
tr	Plur	They have restored my faith in Mechanics .
tr	Plur	We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
tr	Plur	After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
tr	Plur	The waiters are like no other ...
tr	Plur	All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
tr	Plur	The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
tr	Plur	The finest Christmas Trees i ' ve ever seen .
tr	Plur	The owners were entertaining and gracious .
tr	Plur	all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
tr	Plur	They won ' t have a second chance from me .
tr	Plur	Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE .
tr	Plur	With these fusions , chiropractric isn ' t as successful , but it still is very helpful .
tr	Plur	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can ' t see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
tr	Plur	Rude , unprofessional , just jerks .
tr	Plur	Superb Arrangements
tr	Plur	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
tr	Plur	And students get $ 5 off , can ' t argue with that .
tr	Plur	Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
tr	Plur	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
tr	Plur	And non - smokers beware !!!
tr	Plur	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
tr	Plur	Great Sanwiches , Great Prices
tr	Plur	For the quality , the prices ($ 4 -$ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
tr	Plur	The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
tr	Plur	Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
tr	Plur	Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure .
tr	Plur	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( don ' t forget to tell ' em its really a ' pagen ' thing !).
tr	Plur	ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
tr	Plur	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
tr	Plur	With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you ' re money hungry ?
tr	Plur	Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc . THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN ' T PAID .
tr	Plur	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
tr	Plur	We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
tr	Plur	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
tr	Plur	We should have left then .
tr	Plur	We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
tr	Plur	We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
tr	Plur	Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long .
tr	Plur	Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
tr	Plur	Cons : * Server wasn ' t very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
tr	Plur	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
tr	Plur	Other Thoughts : Will try this place again .
tr	Plur	the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
tr	Plur	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
tr	Plur	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
tr	Plur	They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
tr	Plur	They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
tr	Plur	They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
tr	Plur	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
tr	Plur	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
tr	Plur	They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
tr	Plur	Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
tr	Plur	Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service .
tr	Plur	After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
tr	Plur	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
tr	Plur	We live in the sub - division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr . Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
tr	Plur	Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ($ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
tr	Plur	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
tr	Plur	AVOID AT ALL COSTS .
tr	Plur	One of the worst places
tr	Plur	This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
tr	Plur	( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you can ' t just go to WalMart .)
tr	Plur	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
tr	Plur	We were told that we couldn ' t today because they were closing soon .
tr	Plur	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
tr	Plur	They refused .
tr	Plur	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it hadn ' t .
tr	Plur	Over priced for students to learn !
tr	Plur	You can fool people
tr	Plur	They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
tr	Plur	They offer sales that aren ' t really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn ' t , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
tr	Plur	With higher than average prices to boot !
tr	Plur	So don ' t get taken in , keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here .
tr	Plur	"We got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
tr	Plur	Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
tr	Plur	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
tr	Plur	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
tr	Plur	"When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had "" reserved """
tr	Plur	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
tr	Plur	We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
tr	Plur	The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
tr	Plur	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
tr	Plur	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
tr	Plur	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
tr	Plur	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
tr	Plur	We were also served salad and soda .
tr	Plur	We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
tr	Plur	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
tr	Plur	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
tr	Plur	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
tr	Plur	Run for the hills ... you ' ll be much better off !
tr	Plur	We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
tr	Plur	How fast your support queries get answered ?
tr	Plur	We could not have been more welcomed , more comfortable or more well fed .
tr	Plur	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B & B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms . Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
tr	Plur	We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
tr	Plur	The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
tr	Plur	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
tr	Plur	Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we didn ' t mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
tr	Plur	We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
tr	Plur	They certainly know what they are doing .
tr	Plur	They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
tr	Plur	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever its like driving a new car .
tr	Plur	All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
tr	Plur	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife ' s work and towed it back to fix it .
tr	Plur	Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything , and smile while doing it .
tr	Plur	Liars , negative stars !
tr	Plur	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
tr	Plur	However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
tr	Plur	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
tr	Plur	"They "" finished "" the work and told me the car was ready ."
tr	Plur	They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
tr	Plur	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
tr	Plur	Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
tr	Plur	Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
tr	Plur	We signed our name in about 6 : 00pm .
tr	Plur	However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
tr	Plur	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
tr	Plur	We waited until 2 : 25 PM and then left .
tr	Plur	Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained .
tr	Plur	Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
tr	Plur	Best DJ ' s In Town !
tr	Plur	These guys were the best .
tr	Plur	They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
tr	Plur	We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
tr	Plur	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
tr	Plur	They may look young but don ' t let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
tr	Plur	So we didn ' t expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
tr	Plur	They just really know their stuff !
tr	Plur	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
tr	Plur	They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
tr	Plur	Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
tr	Plur	You ' d think they would do a good job but they don ' t care unless they are getting paid full price .
tr	Plur	Billing Issues ...
tr	Plur	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
tr	Plur	We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
tr	Plur	We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
tr	Plur	They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
tr	Plur	On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
tr	Plur	They did that with no problem .
tr	Plur	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
tr	Plur	They recently surprised me a larger order .
tr	Plur	Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
tr	Plur	They have a customer for life in us !
tr	Plur	sheisters
tr	Plur	Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
tr	Plur	Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks .
tr	Plur	Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be .
tr	Plur	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
tr	Plur	On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
tr	Plur	Be warned - they ' ll ltake you for everything they can .
tr	Plur	The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
tr	Plur	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ).
tr	Plur	If I remember , students went to Dartmouth , U . Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others .
tr	Plur	Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program .
tr	Plur	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
tr	Plur	The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
tr	Plur	They don ' t speak the best English but enough to get by .
tr	Plur	They bake bread fresh daily , they don ' t press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
tr	Plur	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
tr	Plur	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way !
tr	Plur	Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
tr	Plur	On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
tr	Plur	Wouldn ' t go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
tr	Plur	The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
tr	Plur	They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
tr	Plur	They don ' t just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
tr	Plur	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
tr	Plur	Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
tr	Plur	Prices are reasonable , ( Kids meals are around 4 . 99 ) and Wednesday ' s they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
tr	Plur	Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service
tr	Plur	And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well !)
tr	Plur	The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
tr	Plur	Best of all , there are no ads !!!!!
tr	Plur	Just previews and the main feature .
tr	Plur	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
tr	Plur	"We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , "" was I gotta have it !"""
tr	Plur	Definitely go see them !
tr	Plur	Are they serious ?
tr	Plur	Either these people don ' t know anything about what they are renting , or worse - they are bait and switching .
tr	Plur	Yes , there are bigger , but bigger isn ' t necessarily better .
tr	Plur	They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
tr	Plur	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
tr	Plur	lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
tr	Plur	However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re - trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
tr	Plur	They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it ' s not room temperature at best when you get it home .
tr	Plur	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
tr	Plur	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ($ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3 . 75 respectively ).
tr	Plur	The other rolls weren ' t at all special , especially given their pricing .
tr	Plur	These are not household type alarms .
tr	Plur	Please do not go there if it ' s professional , friendly , diligent medical services you ' re looking for .
tr	Plur	When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
tr	Plur	Worst Apartments EVER
tr	Plur	We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
tr	Plur	We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
tr	Plur	Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ).
tr	Plur	We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
tr	Plur	Just curtains and a couple of accessories .
tr	Plur	We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
tr	Plur	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
tr	Plur	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
tr	Plur	Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
tr	Plur	They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
tr	Plur	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
tr	Plur	We visited on 7 / 26 / 08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia ' s on Greenfield Ave .
tr	Plur	There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
tr	Plur	ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR .
tr	Plur	their mezza luna ' s are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
tr	Plur	also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it delivered **.
tr	Plur	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
tr	Plur	Perhaps they don ' t deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
tr	Plur	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre - owned 09 XF .
tr	Plur	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
tr	Plur	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
tr	Plur	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
tr	Plur	Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
tr	Plur	Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
tr	Plur	Not only did they answer the phone at 4 : 50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
tr	Plur	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats don ' t do you any good if they blow out ), and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
tr	Plur	They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6 : 30 that evening .
tr	Plur	Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food
tr	Plur	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
tr	Plur	"They also don ' t tell you that they ' re going to mail you an "" application "" to be admitted to be a patient ."
tr	Plur	They don ' t do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
tr	Plur	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
tr	Plur	We were greeted again and sat promptly .
tr	Plur	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
tr	Plur	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
tr	Plur	We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
tr	Plur	We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
tr	Plur	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
tr	Plur	2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
tr	Plur	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1 . 5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www . designofashion . com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
tr	Plur	We are absolutely confident that Stuart ' s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
tr	Plur	The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that ' s not why I ' m writing my review .
tr	Plur	Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
tr	Plur	The intruders slit the screen of the window .
tr	Plur	Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
tr	Plur	Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and didn ' t charge me a dime .
tr	Plur	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
tr	Plur	They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
tr	Plur	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
tr	Plur	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
tr	Plur	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order .
tr	Plur	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
tr	Plur	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
tr	Plur	One of the worst experiences I ' ve ever had with a auto repair shop .
tr	Plur	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
tr	Plur	We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
tr	Plur	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
tr	Plur	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
tr	Plur	"When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that ' s right , the manager ), did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say "" I ' m sorry ""."
tr	Plur	And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
tr	Plur	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
tr	Plur	There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
tr	Plur	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
tr	Plur	There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
tr	Plur	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he ' s so wonderful , you ' re going to love your hair .
tr	Plur	In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
tr	Plur	Bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times
tr	Plur	Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
tr	Plur	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
tr	Plur	( They even got me a couch pretty quickly .)
tr	Plur	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don ' t have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ).
tr	Plur	Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service .
tr	Plur	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
tr	Plur	But we don ' t just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
tr	Plur	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
tr	Plur	We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back .
tr	Plur	They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
tr	Plur	We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
tr	Plur	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
tr	Plur	They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
tr	Plur	Because we think IT ' S THE BEST !!!
tr	Plur	and we don ' t know them except for eating there .
tr	Plur	Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
tr	Plur	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it ' s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
tr	Plur	My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ).
tr	Plur	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe don ' t jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don ' t want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
tr	Plur	Dumbest F ' ers ever
tr	Plur	They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
tr	Plur	They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
tr	Plur	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
tr	Plur	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
tr	Plur	We heard nothing .
tr	Plur	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he ' d send someone out to look at it but couldn ' t promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
tr	Plur	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
tr	Plur	Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
tr	Plur	They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
tr	Plur	In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
tr	Plur	So no totes .
tr	Plur	We returned after 3PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
tr	Plur	Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
tr	Plur	If they think you ' ve taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1 . 50 per can .
tr	Plur	They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
tr	Plur	All these rules are posted in the rooms .)
tr	Plur	Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that didn ' t exist .
tr	Plur	No wine glasses .
tr	Plur	Don ' t get the rooms off the two kitchens .
tr	Plur	Quit with the overstatements !
tr	Plur	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I ' ve ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren ' t explained to you ).
tr	Plur	Though they are mostly excellent , you generally don ' t get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
tr	Plur	Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ).
tr	Plur	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
tr	Plur	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
tr	Plur	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
tr	Plur	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
tr	Plur	"They said they were "" unable to tell me until they ordered my dress ""."
tr	Plur	Do other brides fall for this ???
tr	Plur	"They either : a ) don ' t want to give it to me because they don ' t want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and "" filling the orders "" by their own seamstresses )."
tr	Plur	Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners .
tr	Plur	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
tr	Plur	They promised it ' d be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
tr	Plur	Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
tr	Plur	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I ' m sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
tr	Plur	The employees at this Sear ' s are completely apathetic and there didn ' t seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
va	Sing	From the AP comes this story :
va	Sing	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .
va	Sing	Bush nominated Jennifer M . Anderson for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , replacing Steffen W . Graae .
va	Sing	Bush also nominated A . Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals , replacing John Montague Steadman .
va	Sing	The sheikh in wheel - chair has been attacked with a F - 16 - launched bomb .
va	Sing	He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they didn ' t .
va	Sing	Today ' s incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace .
va	Sing	The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe .
va	Sing	( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ).
va	Sing	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
va	Sing	Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company ' s story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who haven ' t heard it .
va	Sing	Usually , these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up , but this time people are actually concerned about the company ' s plans .
va	Sing	It ' s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you ' d imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company ' s self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
va	Sing	Read the entire article ; there ' s a punchline , too .
va	Sing	My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat ' s passing for al - Qaeda has appeared at Newsday .
va	Sing	Excerpt :
va	Sing	""" Arafat ' s secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky ."
va	Sing	The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
va	Sing	Arafat ' s death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled .
va	Sing	Sharon ' s assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party .
va	Sing	Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
va	Sing	"Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror ."""
va	Sing	Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon ' s murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before .
va	Sing	"The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , "" condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq ."""
va	Sing	Ash - Sharq al - Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike .
va	Sing	In Ramadi , there was a big demonstration .
va	Sing	"Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was "" criminal "" and that "" the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad ""."
va	Sing	"The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , "" It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . ."
va	Sing	"This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region ,"" the message claimed ."
va	Sing	"Xinhua alleged that "" Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation ."""
va	Sing	That ' s overstating it , I know .
va	Sing	What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it ' s always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
va	Sing	Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
va	Sing	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
va	Sing	The other problem ?
va	Sing	It ' s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
va	Sing	As the survey cited in the above - linked article shows , most Google users don ' t intend to use Gmail , and Google isn ' t even as popular as Yahoo ! and AOL .
va	Sing	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
va	Sing	Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
va	Sing	Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
va	Sing	TEHRAN ( AFP ) -
va	Sing	An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
va	Sing	""" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in ,"" Masoud Shojai , head of the country ' s "" Iran Cartoon "" association and the fair organizer , said ."
va	Sing	""" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison ,"" he added ."
va	Sing	Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran ' s Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
va	Sing	He added that around 1 , 100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
va	Sing	He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12 , 000 , 8 , 000 and 5 , 000 dollars respectively .
va	Sing	This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
va	Sing	When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
va	Sing	The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
va	Sing	Allawi ' s aged cousin and the man ' s wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
va	Sing	In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
va	Sing	If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
va	Sing	The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
va	Sing	He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
va	Sing	The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
va	Sing	Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .
va	Sing	For some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog .
va	Sing	[ Am at a conference and can ' t blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days .]
va	Sing	Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
va	Sing	At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
va	Sing	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’ s ever seen .
va	Sing	President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
va	Sing	With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
va	Sing	Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
va	Sing	The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
va	Sing	It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
va	Sing	North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
va	Sing	It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
va	Sing	The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
va	Sing	America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’ s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
va	Sing	I ran across this item on the Internet .
va	Sing	"The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U . S . citizens ( most of whom were "" dual - citizens "")."
va	Sing	Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U . S . citizen .
va	Sing	"To pander to the mythical "" Arab street "", of course ."
va	Sing	Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ).
va	Sing	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U . S . citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
va	Sing	A lawsuit .
va	Sing	That ' s right , folks .
va	Sing	The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts .
va	Sing	Here ' s an excerpt from the article :
va	Sing	Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
va	Sing	The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
va	Sing	""" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home ,"" Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit ."
va	Sing	"I was on my way to my wedding fearing death , basically ."""
va	Sing	Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20 , 000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
va	Sing	Dear Nina ,
va	Sing	Here ' s a tip : Don ' t get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter - attack !
va	Sing	Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making .
va	Sing	"Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin ' s "" White House Briefing "" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ):"
va	Sing	At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
va	Sing	This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn ' t anticipated .
va	Sing	""" Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there ' s a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President ."
va	Sing	After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
va	Sing	""" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that ."
va	Sing	( Laughter .)
va	Sing	There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I don ' t know .
va	Sing	I ' m just speculating now .
va	Sing	I really haven ' t thought about writing a book .
va	Sing	My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job .
va	Sing	( Laughter .)
va	Sing	But if -- there ' s a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
va	Sing	It ' s a Western scene by a guy named W . H . S . Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Sing	It ' s on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O ' Neill in Midland , Texas .
va	Sing	He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
va	Sing	So he ' s got a -- I ' m a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
va	Sing	( Applause .)
va	Sing	( Laughter .)
va	Sing	This is not a filibuster .
va	Sing	( Laughter .)
va	Sing	That ' s a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
va	Sing	( Applause .)
va	Sing	The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor .
va	Sing	One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn .
va	Sing	The painting is based upon the hymn called , ' A Charge to Keep .'
va	Sing	I have .
va	Sing	The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .
va	Sing	I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can .
va	Sing	( Applause .)
va	Sing	""" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep ."
va	Sing	And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
va	Sing	"( Applause .)"""
va	Sing	Now that ' s a rambling response .
va	Sing	"And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "" A Charge to Keep ""?"
va	Sing	"That was the name of his "" autobiography "" -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 ."
va	Sing	There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and / or acquiring Firefox .
va	Sing	It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
va	Sing	I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
va	Sing	Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
va	Sing	He announced this in January :
va	Sing	As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc . of Mountain View , California .
va	Sing	My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1 . 1 , 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 releases .
va	Sing	I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
va	Sing	He also announced this in January :
va	Sing	Welcome Darin !
va	Sing	"I just want to extend a big "" Welcome !"" to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week ."
va	Sing	2005 is going to rock !
va	Sing	Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25 , 2005 :
va	Sing	"Me and the big "" G """
va	Sing	Following on the heels of Ben ' s annoucement yesterday , I thought I ' d post that I have joined Google as well .
va	Sing	Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
va	Sing	Posted by darin
va	Sing	Ben made another announcement on March 28 , 2005 :
va	Sing	I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
va	Sing	Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years ,...
va	Sing	Great to have you on board !
va	Sing	Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it ' s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
va	Sing	In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
va	Sing	If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
va	Sing	This is one thought - provoking film .
va	Sing	Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer .
va	Sing	"Just one small commment - it ' s not possible , as far as I know , for Google to "" Aquire "" Firefox ."
va	Sing	I ' m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non - Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they ' re ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
va	Sing	It ' s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
va	Sing	Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic .
va	Sing	Thanks for the link .
va	Sing	Malach , What you say makes sense .
va	Sing	Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go .
va	Sing	It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis - matches .
va	Sing	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr ' s movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
va	Sing	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
va	Sing	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
va	Sing	At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ?
va	Sing	One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
va	Sing	State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
va	Sing	Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ).
va	Sing	The Washington Monthly ' s Who ' s Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
va	Sing	"Sept . 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept . 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "" protect Israel ,"" according to the Asian Times ."
va	Sing	I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
va	Sing	But they haven ' t been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
va	Sing	Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
va	Sing	This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at .
va	Sing	There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don ' t want to fall into it .
va	Sing	But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
va	Sing	So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
va	Sing	"' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group ' s "" striking arm "" in Iraq ."
va	Sing	""" I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas ,"" Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah ."
va	Sing	Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas .
va	Sing	""" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same ,"" al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad ."
va	Sing	He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
va	Sing	And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
va	Sing	The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
va	Sing	I ' m not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
va	Sing	Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for .
va	Sing	i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out .
va	Sing	I definitely could use a drink , actually a couple would probably do better .
va	Sing	Bryan , you ' re in , right ?
va	Sing	Anybody up for happy hour after work ?
va	Sing	I was thinking Kenneally ' s at around 5 .
va	Sing	Let me know
va	Sing	you don ' t know what that means ?
va	Sing	where did you grow up ?
va	Sing	india ?
va	Sing	should I be embarrassed that I haven ' t the slightest idea what that means ?
va	Sing	i am going out tonight to get wasted if anyone is interested .

va	Sing	It is my understanding , from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
va	Sing	The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone ' s right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
va	Sing	Deal your meal from where the dishes are located .
va	Sing	I . E . the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
va	Sing	It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .
va	Sing	Power be where power lies .

va	Sing	I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP .
va	Sing	Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA .
va	Sing	However , he also mentioned we were a close sixth , that is close to the fifth highest bid .
va	Sing	He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid .
va	Sing	He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure .
va	Sing	NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter , I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP .

va	Sing	I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 giving about 44 , 000 price observations .
va	Sing	However , the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept .
va	Sing	The coefficient and standard error are as followed :
va	Sing	Intercept : - 0 . 3931 ( 0 . 0076 )
va	Sing	Slope : 0 . 1171 ( 0 . 0022 )

va	Sing	Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminated between ADHD , LD , and control subjects .
va	Sing	I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet .
va	Sing	The test itself is what is called a substitution test .
va	Sing	It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
va	Sing	I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it .
va	Sing	The test , along with an information form , is available at : .
va	Sing	I think a test like this one is much needed .
va	Sing	A person can take it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA .
va	Sing	Perhaps you are willing to recommend this site and , if you have a website , place a link on your website .
va	Sing	i dont know what it is , but since a very young age i have had a strange but very gratifying urge to torture or maime animals .

va	Sing	Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ), the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala .
va	Sing	In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth .
va	Sing	Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams .
va	Sing	The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life , so the plant was shut down last week .
va	Sing	Moral of the story : Don ' t drink Coke .......... drink Pepsi !

va	Sing	( New Scientist Space )
va	Sing	NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
va	Sing	""" It ' s not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon ,"" says Brett Alexander , vice - president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS ."
va	Sing	NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
va	Sing	Outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative , considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator .
va	Sing	Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world .
va	Sing	( New Scientist Space )
va	Sing	On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
va	Sing	""" That kind of a financial incentive [...] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge ,"" Griffin said ."
va	Sing	""" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ], but I do not expect it ,"" Griffin added ."
va	Sing	Only time will reveal whether Griffin ' s expectations are either exceeded or confirmed .
va	Sing	But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .

va	Sing	Normally this author is semi - objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi . com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ).
va	Sing	One thing is certain for sure .
va	Sing	"If Abbas keeps up this "" macho talk "" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank ."

va	Sing	Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan . 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec . 25 , 2004 .
va	Sing	Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat ' s legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood .
va	Sing	It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
va	Sing	He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
va	Sing	Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel ' s partially completed West Bank barrier .
va	Sing	Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
va	Sing	"Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue "" very important and very dangerous ."""
va	Sing	Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
va	Sing	If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
va	Sing	Selah !

va	Sing	( Hat Tip : Captains Quarters )
va	Sing	( BBC )
va	Sing	The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence .
va	Sing	In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
va	Sing	"Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "" unrestricted "" strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight ."
va	Sing	It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
va	Sing	Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas ' s leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it ' s former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
va	Sing	Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil .
va	Sing	Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
va	Sing	( Jerusalem Post )
va	Sing	""" We ' re not happy with Hamas ' s position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians ,"" commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official ."
va	Sing	""" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda ."""
va	Sing	""" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel ' s scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure ,"" Habib said ."
va	Sing	""" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression ."
va	Sing	"Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war ."""
va	Sing	"Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire , and hopes to turn the Gaza strip "" into a vast battlefield ."""
va	Sing	Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

va	Sing	my female chameleon just laid eggs yesterday and today some of the eggs are soft when i mean soft i mean like not like ordinary chameleon eggs .

va	Sing	If she continues !

te	Sing	What if Google Morphed Into GoogleOS ?
te	Sing	What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e - mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
te	Sing	[ via Microsoft Watch from Mary Jo Foley ]
te	Sing	( And , by the way , is anybody else just a little nostalgic for the days when that was a good thing ?)
te	Sing	This BuzzMachine post argues that Google ' s rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we ' ve all heard before , but it ' s particularly well - put in this post .
te	Sing	Google is a nice search engine .
te	Sing	Does anybody use it for anything else ?
te	Sing	Is that a money maker ?
te	Sing	I ' m staying away from the stock .
te	Sing	I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways .
te	Sing	John Donovan from Argghhh ! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah .
te	Sing	Click here To view it .
te	Sing	He makes some good observations on a few of the pic ' s .
te	Sing	One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah .
te	Sing	On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video ' s .
te	Sing	You have to see these slides .... they are amazing .
te	Sing	This Fallujah operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the US Military since the end of the war .
te	Sing	Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google ' s new toolbar , which , as noted in the linked article , commits just about every sin an online marketer could commit , and makes up a few new ones besides .
te	Sing	I ' m not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument
te	Sing	( You don ' t need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you don ' t need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you ' re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ).
te	Sing	However , this toolbar is really bad news .
te	Sing	On the other hand , it looks pretty cool .
te	Sing	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
te	Sing	One can suspect the Iranian Government .
te	Sing	But there is no proof .
te	Sing	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
te	Sing	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn ' t even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
te	Sing	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
te	Sing	But will diplomacy work ?
te	Sing	And can anyone use military pressure without proof ?
te	Sing	One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage .
te	Sing	He has denied this .
te	Sing	It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof .
te	Sing	"Reuters reported that "" Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today ."""
te	Sing	"It read , "" The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah ."
te	Sing	Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there , since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals .
te	Sing	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v . Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D . C . Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
te	Sing	The actual vote is a little confusing .
te	Sing	Stay with me now : John Paul STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV , VI through VI - D - iii , VI - D - v , and VII , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined , and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI - D - iv , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined .
te	Sing	KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II .
te	Sing	SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO joined .
te	Sing	THOMAS filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA joined , and in which ALITO joined as to all but Parts I , II - C - 1 , and III - B - 2 .
te	Sing	ALITO filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III .
te	Sing	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
te	Sing	I ' ll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I ' m finished .
te	Sing	Important news such as President Bush ' s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti - gay ( update : he ' s not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
te	Sing	I had to go to the BBC for this report .
te	Sing	It ' s symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
te	Sing	It ' s just disappointing .
te	Sing	Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .
te	Sing	At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .
te	Sing	The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15 , 000 , according to analysts .
te	Sing	Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
te	Sing	It ' s a move that really worries me ; Buffett ' s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
te	Sing	It ' s a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
te	Sing	Which essentially sounds like he ' s worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
te	Sing	I assume his actual reason is that he ' s worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can ' t grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
te	Sing	I ' m not sure how the market will react .
te	Sing	It doesn ' t change the company ' s intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
te	Sing	On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
te	Sing	em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .
te	Sing	He ' s not giving 85 % away , he ' s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ?).
te	Sing	He mentions his wife ' s death having an effect on him .
te	Sing	It sounds pretty rational that he ' s saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
te	Sing	Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :
te	Sing	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
te	Sing	To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria ' s promised withdrawal .
te	Sing	Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .
te	Sing	"UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "" recognize Hezbollah "" after easily being duped by "" the message on the placards they are using ""."
te	Sing	This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .
te	Sing	The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
te	Sing	The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .
te	Sing	I ' ve been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .
te	Sing	Wtf is this ?
te	Sing	This is a terrorist organization plain and simple .
te	Sing	This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80 ' s and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?
te	Sing	This is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .
te	Sing	It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .
te	Sing	The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .
te	Sing	That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .
te	Sing	Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans .
te	Sing	"In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "" raiding forces "" in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins ."
te	Sing	"The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , "" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah ."
te	Sing	"Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral ."""
te	Sing	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .
te	Sing	"The statement said , "" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal ."""
te	Sing	"It called a "" ploy "" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah ."
te	Sing	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .
te	Sing	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :
te	Sing	WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
te	Sing	""" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism ,"" said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group ."
te	Sing	Which is why he didn ' t say we ' re at war with Islamic people .
te	Sing	We ' re at war with Islamic fascists .
te	Sing	"By using the word "" Islamic "" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier ."
te	Sing	And if you haven ' t heard by now , the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :

te	Sing	Zakaria Amara , 20 , Mississauga , Ont .;
te	Sing	Asad Ansari , 21 , Mississauga ;
te	Sing	Shareef Abdelhaleen , 30 , Mississauga ;
te	Sing	Qayyum Abdul Jamal , 43 , Mississauga ;
te	Sing	Mohammed Dirie , 22 , Kingston , Ont .;
te	Sing	Yasim Abdi Mohamed , 24 , Kingston ;
te	Sing	Jahmaal James , 23 , Toronto ;
te	Sing	Amin Mohamed Durrani , 19 , Toronto ;
te	Sing	Steven Vikash Chand alias Abdul Shakur , 25 , Toronto ;
te	Sing	Ahmad Mustafa Ghany , 21 , Mississauga ;
te	Sing	Saad Khalid , 19 , of Eclipse Avenue , Mississauga .
te	Sing	Folks , if it ' s Islamic , and fascist , it ' s an Islamic fascist .
te	Sing	"On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , "" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden ."""
te	Sing	This pledge is a new development .
te	Sing	Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days .
te	Sing	One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .
te	Sing	"If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "" picked up "" by al - Qaeda ."
te	Sing	This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush ' s aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .
te	Sing	It is a setback for the war on terror .
te	Sing	"Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "" Afghan Arabs "" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden ."
te	Sing	"It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5 , 000 - strong "" 55th Brigade "" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition ."
te	Sing	Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia ' s some 15 million citizens .
te	Sing	After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .
te	Sing	Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .
te	Sing	Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .
te	Sing	Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .
te	Sing	The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al - Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings .
te	Sing	The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday .
te	Sing	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden ' s plot .
te	Sing	Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush .
te	Sing	Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .
te	Sing	Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9 / 11 if he had known it was coming .
te	Sing	"The question is , "" Should he have known it was coming ?"""
te	Sing	"The answer is , "" Yes !"""
te	Sing	Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there , already in January or February of 2001 .
te	Sing	Wolfowitz contradicted counter - terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie ' s crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
te	Sing	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
te	Sing	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .
te	Sing	( On what evidence ?
te	Sing	The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ).
te	Sing	"Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were "" no good targets "" in Afghanistan ."
te	Sing	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .
te	Sing	Bush did not have his eye on the ball .
te	Sing	Neither did Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz .
te	Sing	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter - terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
te	Sing	Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
te	Sing	"Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet ' s hair was "" on fire "" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists ."
te	Sing	As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .
te	Sing	Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .
te	Sing	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
te	Sing	You also need Pakistani air space .
te	Sing	The plan was all set and could have succeeded .
te	Sing	But in fall of 1999 , Gen . Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .
te	Sing	The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .
te	Sing	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn ' t use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
te	Sing	Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .
te	Sing	Of course , you could just go in by main force .
te	Sing	It should be easily googled .
te	Sing	Clinton tried , and tried hard .
te	Sing	"that is how i want you to refer to me as "" the king """
te	Sing	i don ' t think so .

te	Sing	Jeff
te	Sing	Well , he launched today .
te	Sing	Have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today ?
te	Sing	I think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California ' s broken system --- a potential spoiler .
te	Sing	Well , wouldn ' t you know it .
te	Sing	I ' m not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil .
te	Sing	I ' m not sure , but I think that he ' s got class tonite , too .
te	Sing	I ' ll search him out before class or after that break and see if I can set it up .
te	Sing	daily dose on enron -
te	Sing	i need to now get a job at house of pies b / c that is the only way to pay the bills .
te	Sing	the economy is down and when enron collapses , the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt .
te	Sing	not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks .
te	Sing	"Since work has gone to hell , I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl ( if Rohan "" Alabama "" Davey shows up for the next 3 games .)"
te	Sing	However , do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season .
te	Sing	i have stronger will than you think .
te	Sing	house of pies here i come .
te	Sing	i am sure i could have persuaded you to give me some action .
te	Sing	why is enron blowing up ?
te	Sing	i didn ' t want you to go .
te	Sing	i was just going to sleep anyway .
te	Sing	i was too tired to give you any action .
te	Sing	enron is blowing up .
te	Sing	Vince ,
te	Sing	Further to my voicemail , our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve on the PSE swap .
te	Sing	Volatility of USD / DM has been in the range of between 7 % and 11 %.
te	Sing	In addition , is there someone who could consider the correlation between US CPI and the $/ euro exchange rate .
te	Sing	Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide .
te	Sing	Sid
te	Sing	Vincent ,
te	Sing	I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston .
te	Sing	I enjoyed your presentations very much .
te	Sing	I was wondering if you could give me some references regarding the calculation of correlation coefficients from a GARCH model .
te	Sing	Thank you .

te	Sing	Thank you for you patience .
te	Sing	The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995 .
te	Sing	By September of that year the Dow had tumbled to 744 .
te	Sing	The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of ' 67 .
te	Sing	By March of ' 68 the Dow had fallen to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of ' 68 .
te	Sing	The Dow then sank to 631 in December of ' 70 .
te	Sing	By April of ' 71 the Dow had climbed back to 950 , only to fall to 869 in February of ' 72 .
te	Sing	A big rally then took the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of ' 73 , turning everyone bullish .
te	Sing	But by December of ' 73 the Dow had collapsed to 788 .
te	Sing	Think that was bad - by December of ' 74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 .
te	Sing	At that time , the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism .
te	Sing	Of course , that was the bottom
te	Sing	And that ' s the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down .

te	Sing	It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved .
te	Sing	""" NASA will initiate development of a Crew Launch Vehicle derived from space shuttle solid rocket boosters with a new upper stage for human spaceflight ,"" said the letter , signed by NASA Administrator Mike Griffin and the Pentagon ' s top space official , ex - astronaut Ron Sega ..."
te	Sing	""" NASA then plans to develop a new 100 - metric - ton - class launch vehicle derived from existing capabilities with the space shuttle external tanks and solid rocket boosters for future missions to the moon ,"" the letter said ."
te	Sing	NASA is planning on using these new shuttles to replace the current models , with industry forecasters predicting a launch as early as 2014 .
te	Sing	The new rocket design will differ slightly from it ' s predecessors , in the fact that the crew and cargo would launch separately from two different rockets each and join up in space later on .
te	Sing	Launching this way will hopefully avoid future disasters , giving more support towards NASA revisiting the stars .

te	Sing	A pacman frog will need a heat source that creates a basking temp in the upper 80 ' s F for at least 10 - 12 hours a day .

te	Sing	its cheap and its good !
te	Sing	Depends of what .
te	Sing	If you mean fluid ounces , 20 , as opposed to the 16 in America .
te	Sing	An Irish pint is larger than a US one .
te	Sing	Know this well because I remember an ' irish ' pub in the town in canada i grew up in used to advertise the cheapest pints of guinness in town , but they served them in american sized pints .
te	Sing	That place didn ' t stay open too long : D
te	Sing	need help finding irish music ?
te	Sing	i love The Script and know there from iraland .
te	Sing	i would like more bands like them pleasseee
te	Sing	The thing about The Script is they do not sound that Irish , I was surprised to hear they were from Dublin .
te	Sing	Well if you are interested , I suggest you have a look at General Fiasco , Two Door Cinema Club and Wallis Bird .

te	Sing	"I doubt you will get a sensible answer in the "" TRAVEL "" section ."
te	Sing	* Ireland
te	Sing	And there ' s nothing distinctly Irish about them .
te	Sing	Women ' s rain coat ... where can I find one ?
te	Sing	I ' m going on a trip to Europe soon , and I need to find a good , quality raincoat .
te	Sing	I ' ve looked and looked , but cannot find one anywhere !

te	Sing	It actually needs to be relatively waterproof - the last one I bought had me soaked in anything more than light / moderate rain .
te	Sing	I ' ll pay up to 200 - 250 for it if I have to .
te	Sing	Look on the debenhams website

te	Sing	I have a Kodak Camera ( 10 . 2 Megapixels )... Kodak AF 5x OPTICAL LENS ... how do I pause it while recording ?
te	Sing	"You don ' t ... there ' s no such thing as "" pause "" in digital recording ."
te	Sing	That ' s because of the buffer that holds the data until it ' s ready to be recorded to the memory card .
te	Sing	When you press the button to stop recording the data is moved from the buffer to the memory card - no pause .
te	Sing	All you can do is take each section ( individual video ) and edit them together on software .
te	Sing	I have a Nacho Libre question .?
te	Sing	When nacho is driving to cure the influenza guy does he say to the man with the cow i like your blouse or I like your cow because my friend thinks he says I like your blouse , but that wouldn ' t make sense .
te	Sing	I know its in the wrong catagory , but still , I wrote this question for a reason , not for you to critisize me .
te	Sing	Okay , FIRST , you have posted a question about an American movie , set in Mexico , in the Dining Out in Argentina category .
te	Sing	Do you get what ' s wrong with this picture ?
te	Sing	No ... that ' s all .
te	Sing	Nacho Libre is suppose to be inspired in Mexicans , not in Argentineans .

te	Sing	Along with the great burger try a brick of onion rings if you are with someone .

te	Sing	What should I do ?
te	Sing	I ' ve tried bland white rice but he wont eat anything .
te	Sing	What could it be ?
te	Sing	Should I be concerned ?
te	Sing	Call a vet would be a good idea with a sick dog
te	Sing	plz bring your dog to the vet ASAP !!!
te	Sing	esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY !!!
te	Sing	or has acquired some type of disease and that too needs to be attended to ...
te	Sing	i doing a research paper on donatello and i notice that there are two statues of David , a bronze one and marble one .
te	Sing	Michelangelo made the marble one but why did he do another if Donatello had already made one ?
te	Sing	so im a little confused , why is there two statues of David ?
te	Sing	Because he liked making statues of David ! : D
te	Sing	Obviously , he should have been arrested and jailed - imagine making a statue or painting on the same subject as another artist - clearly insulting and disrespecting - wasted time that could have been used making a statue with clothes on .
te	Sing	Name of specific Hibachi restaurant in Chicago ?
te	Sing	I have a friend out in Chicago this week , and I am trying to remember the name of an awesome hibachi style restaurant i visited while out there a couple years ago .
te	Sing	I think it was in the Lincoln Square area but don ' t quote me on that .
te	Sing	It ' s ' gimmick ' was that you fill your bowl cafeteria - style from raw ingredients and leave it on the counter with a chopstick listing your table number on it .

te	Sing	What ' s the best time to start a trip around the world ?
te	Sing	Well , I ' m about to graduate in less then a year , and I ' m planning to study medical school .
te	Sing	But since in my country it lasts for minimum 6 years , and I want to go aground the world , what do you think , should I do it before or after medical school ?
te	Sing	If you have to wait , due to financial reasons , then wait .
te	Sing	I would much rather put it off until I can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as I ' m sure this trip is intended to be .
te	Sing	Airfare alone will be incredibly expensive so make sure you have the money and of course free time to take your time and have a great time .
te	Sing	canon t2i stops working ?
te	Sing	"My canon t2i stops working at times as in the power bottom is switched to "" on "" but the camera does not respond to any function ."
te	Sing	the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in .
te	Sing	did anyone have this issue ?
te	Sing	is it worthy to send in for warranty repair ?
te	Sing	thanks !
te	Sing	Sounds simple enough to me .
te	Sing	Your camera isn ' t acting normally , you got warranty , let Canon deal with it .
te	Sing	I would agree .
te	Sing	I shoot a t1i and haven ' t had such an issue .
te	Sing	I also agree it ' s under warranty so get in touch with Canon .
te	Sing	It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re - boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re - start from time to time but it shouldn ' t be happening in a camera .
te	Sing	Call Canon
te	Sing	Cheapest airline ticket from Raleigh to Philippines ?
te	Sing	I ' m going on a vacation to the Philippines in May 2012 , and I ' m starting from Raleigh , NC ( RDU Airport ).
te	Sing	The sooner the better but I ' d probably wait until after the holidays .
te	Sing	Use Travelocity or Expedia and see what you come up with .
te	Sing	My friend goes to the Phils every 6 months or so and she has found that Korean Air has had the cheapest fares lately .
te	Sing	Raleigh to Chicago , Chicago to Seoul and then Seoul to Manila .
te	Sing	Compare compare compare - that ' s the key to getting the best deal .

te	Sing	I don ' t want to have to deal with those deal - a - day websites like Groupon .
te	Sing	I just want a simple way to get a good deal to whatever Restaurant I want , whenever I want .
te	Sing	I usually use ZebraKlub .
te	Sing	So you can pretty much get whatever deal you want anytime .
te	Sing	If you want to eat cheaply without worrying about all those daily deal emails every day , ZebraKlub should be perfect for you .

te	Sing	I was thinking cichlids ?
te	Sing	Possibly a freshwater tank with a ton of different species in there .
te	Sing	I ' ve never kept cichlids though .
te	Sing	I know saltwater is a possibility , can you give me a possible stocking option for that too ?
te	Sing	I ' ll choose the one that sounds the best after looking into all the fish :)
te	Sing	Here is the stocking for my 150 gallon tank i upgraded it to 200 at the weekend because of the clownloach A 200 gallon with 6 pairs of Breeding Angel fish fire mouth honey Gouramis 5 8 inch clownloach a Krib and 5 1 inch clown loach with 16 cory cats 5 Australian Rainbows

te	Sing	okay , I dont have a review , but why in the hell would you name your business something that has the initials KKK .... is there something behind the scenes at this place ?
te	Sing	Like I ' m legitimately concerned at this point ... lol
te	Sing	Fresh and Excellent Quality
te	Sing	The food is always fresh and delicious .
te	Sing	It can be a little on the spicy side but just ask them exactly what you want and they are very helpful .
te	Sing	I really want to like this place since I work right around the corner .
te	Sing	Unfortunately , I ' ve given it a couple of tries at different times and decided to stop going .
te	Sing	Class act .
te	Sing	It was late in the day and I was worried I would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever .
te	Sing	Would do business with them again .
te	Sing	Great service
te	Sing	Don ' t judge a book by its cover

te	Sing	I would highly recommend her services .
te	Sing	slow service
te	Sing	"I used to take my cars there all thetime , but management changes hands too frequently , the service has been slow , and they often try to "" add on "" extra services , which sometimes is not needed ."

te	Sing	She ' s the best !
te	Sing	this dentist want to pull the tooth out always .. always wants to do the cheapest for his benefit .. not unless he knows you .
te	Sing	and hopefully you do not know the same people because he tells others about you payment status .
te	Sing	Which should be a private issue
te	Sing	I hired this company to unlock my car .
te	Sing	The price they gave was good so I said hey this seems great .
te	Sing	After they showed up there was a little trouble to get my car unlocked , it took quite a bit of time but the job was well done .
te	Sing	Bulwark regarding service by Eric
te	Sing	Just wanted you to know that Eric came by as scheduled today and sprayed our house for scorpions .
te	Sing	He seemed to understand how important it was for us to make sure the whole house was sprayed so he took his time .
te	Sing	Thank you !
te	Sing	A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE !
te	Sing	I remain unhappy .
te	Sing	I still have noticeable scarring .
te	Sing	I still have surgically induced hair loss .

te	Sing	My favorite place ...
te	Sing	My daughter and I stayed here again from the 7th to the 14th of December .
te	Sing	yet again it was a great stay from begiinning to end .
te	Sing	Okay our room was at times noisy but we were in a mega busy city at an extremely busy time of year .
te	Sing	A Definite No
te	Sing	Expect either undercooked or mushy food and lackluster service .
te	Sing	Even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at Sprecher ' s .
te	Sing	Wonderful Atmosphere
te	Sing	I have been going there since I was a little girl and love the friendly and relaxing atmosphere .
te	Sing	Dr . Stiefvater has always been very professional and helpful .
te	Sing	I would recommend Bayside Chiropractic to anyone who is in need of a regular adjustment or is suffering from a chronic condition .
te	Sing	Channel Guide
te	Sing	Believe it or not , but the channel guide has been most helpful to my family members that visit and don ' t know where to start when it comes to watching satellite tv .
te	Sing	I just give them guide and they can find anything they need .
te	Sing	Thanks again , Directv .
te	Sing	Michael helped shoot the majority of my firm ' s website and we could not have been happier .
te	Sing	He ' s worth every penny .
te	Sing	Average food and deathly slow service
te	Sing	I have eaten here several times and everytime the service is slower than slow .
te	Sing	There must be a better mexican place in Rockland .
te	Sing	I am in love with the giant plate of nachos !
te	Sing	Last time I went however , my beer was warm and the service was so - so .
te	Sing	I get that careless teenager kind of treatment from some of their staff ... perhaps they should hire more serious adults to help serve / cook .
te	Sing	nice friendly local bagel place
te	Sing	While other may be ok waiting in line at Town Bagel we are happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagels
te	Sing	The service was friendly and fast , but this just doesnt make up for the lack - luster product .
te	Sing	a staple !
te	Sing	I live in the neighborhood and this place is one of my favorites for a tasty , quick and inexpensive meal .
te	Sing	Branch out and try something other than the Pad Thai , the curries are fantastic .
te	Sing	Fast and friendly service , they know my order when I walk in the door !

te	Sing	Deep tissue massage helps with pain in neck and shoulders
te	Sing	Seth provides deep tissue massage which has significantly reduced the pain in my neck and shoulders and added flexibility and movement back to the area .
te	Sing	He listens and is excellent in diagnosing , addressing and explaining the specific issues and suggesting exercises to use .
te	Plur	They own blogger , of course .
te	Plur	Compare the flags to the Fallujah one .
te	Plur	The United States doesn ' t believe the Iranian Government .
te	Plur	They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti - proliferation treaty .
te	Plur	Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure .
te	Plur	We don ' t have to believe him .
te	Plur	But we can ' t prove it .
te	Plur	Angry crowds chanted anti - American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop . 256 , 000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday .
te	Plur	"Let aggressive ( American ) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city ' s security and safety , and ask them to lift their hands from the city ."""
te	Plur	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders .
te	Plur	Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country ' s wealth and power .
te	Plur	They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .
te	Plur	BREYER filed a concurring opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG joined .
te	Plur	Two weeks later , and the violence continues .
te	Plur	And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .
te	Plur	So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .
te	Plur	Because the 10 . 000 . 000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead .
te	Plur	"Over three years after 9 - 11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "" terrorist "" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts ."
te	Plur	The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .
te	Plur	Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti - Shiite pogroms .
te	Plur	"U . S . Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "" war with Islamic fascists ,"" saying the term could inflame anti - Muslim tensions ."
te	Plur	U . S . officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .
te	Plur	We ' ve got a Steven , the one word that didn ' t crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .
te	Plur	But because we don ' t want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone ' s a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it ' s ever been .
te	Plur	In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ).
te	Plur	They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .
te	Plur	They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .
te	Plur	( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ).
te	Plur	These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra .
te	Plur	So now there are hundreds of al - Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before .
te	Plur	This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .
te	Plur	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
te	Plur	Even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq .
te	Plur	( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9 / 11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ??)
te	Plur	They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam ' s great white whale .
te	Plur	They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to .
te	Plur	But for those of you tempted in that direction , please look up Carter ' s Tabas operation .
te	Plur	The gods weren ' t with us on that one .
te	Plur	they are great dogs .

te	Plur	"Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made in support of EPMI ' s obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement ("" PPA "") and Green Premium Sharing Agreement ("" GSPA "").?"
te	Plur	As we discussed last week , since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants , we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks .
te	Plur	We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller ' s obligations under the PPA .
te	Plur	We will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today .
